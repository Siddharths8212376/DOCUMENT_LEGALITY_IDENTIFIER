L44321 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very worried about my brain and my spine.
L44320 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I think we should all take it tonight. Everyone's staying, stays.  No driving. That's the rule.  I love you Sally-Mae. You're going to have a fabulous time.
L44315 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ It's ecstasy, Sal.
L44314 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Dolphins.  Great.
L44288 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Whatever!  You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day...
L44287 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Not properly watered.
L44257 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm not fucking angry, for God's sake.
L44256 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Dinner.  Don't be angry.
L44255 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Truce.
L44254 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Truce?
L44253 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Okay, knock it off.
L44252 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
L44251 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ It's an unfair advantage.
L44246 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Panes is not on your team anymore.
L44245 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Still champions.
L44192 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ It's alright.  Be our guests.
L44191 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Two minutes.
L43889 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ It's taken care of.
L43888 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Well, not yet.  The gate was open?
L43847 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Okay.  Last one to find Otis is a smelly old bum.
L43846 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Yes.
L43837 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Who'd like to go and find Otis?
L43836 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ In the kitchen.
L43758 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a rock star in London.  His novels sell millions.
L43757 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Otis!  No barking!
L43734 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You can never be too early or too thin.
L43733 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Of course we do.  We have to sign our taxes.
L43729 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'll say as little as possible.
L43728 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
L43725 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Really?
L43724 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
L43723 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I'm going to throw up.
L43722 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm looking forward to meeting you, too. And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. Eternally grateful, really.
L43720 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Skye!  I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually.  You read the book again?  Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park.  Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left.
L43719 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.
L43718 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
L43717 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You want me to uninvite her?
L43716 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
L43715 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
L43714 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
L43713 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.
L43712 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
L43711 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What?
L43710 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Well, it might be Clair.  They're threatening not to come...
L43709 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Don't get it.
L43708 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ For good.
L43707 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I mean, you're really back.
L43706 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ We're great.
L43705 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
L43704 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No.  I missed that.
L43703 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ No.  Did you?
L43702 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
L43701 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ What?
L43700 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Not.
L43699 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Through the sweats or not?
L43698 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Kiss the back of my knees.
L43695 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ In the morning, after everyone's gone and there's just us.
L43694 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What did you get me?
L43693 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
L43692 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Accept a compliment.
L43691 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Hardly...
L43690 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.
L43686 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Happy anniversary.
L43685 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Happy anniversary, baby.
L43684 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh, well, we'll just have to try again. Sound like a plan?
L43683 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ No luck.
L44733 +++$+++ u3711 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ PANES +++$+++ I'll do it.
L44732 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Sure.
L44731 +++$+++ u3711 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ PANES +++$+++ Coffee?
L44196 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Come on, Panes...
L44195 +++$+++ u3711 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ PANES +++$+++ What's a sign for that?
L44004 +++$+++ u3711 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ PANES +++$+++ She'll never call again.  She called last week to tell me she'll never call again. Where's Sally?
L44003 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Has she called?
L44002 +++$+++ u3711 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ PANES +++$+++ Oh, you know, I am.
L44001 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Panes!  How are you?
L43843 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ It's Jerry's worst idea.
L43842 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Ours.
L43841 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ He's the best dog in the world.  They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea.
L43840 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ The infamous dog?
L43806 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Mmm hmmm.
L43805 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see?
L43804 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Ah.
L43803 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
L43802 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ And I you.
L43801 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.
L43800 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Do I put you off?
L43799 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
L43798 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Joking.
L43797 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Don't be silly.
L43796 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Not long.
L43795 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
L43794 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Don't I find what?
L43793 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
L43792 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes I did.
L43791 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ It's very good.  I understand you won the Booker Prize.
L43790 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No.
L43789 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron?
L43788 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes.
L43787 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
L43786 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ It's a novel.
L43785 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
L43784 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes, she is.
L43783 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
L43782 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
L43781 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book.
L43780 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh.  Well.  Good.
L43779 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Nothing that can't be exchanged.
L43778 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
L43740 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Lovely.
L43739 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?
L43738 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ We have a gift?
L44359 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh don't.  Everyone says that.
L44358 +++$+++ u3709 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ No.  No.  Let me tell you something.  Directing's the best preparation possible for fatherhood.  The sleep depravation alone.
L44357 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh.  You're serious.
L44356 +++$+++ u3709 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ I meant Sally.
L44355 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I meant Sally.
L44354 +++$+++ u3709 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Well, you know...good days, bad days.
L44351 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ God, I really need to jump about a bit.  How's your film going?
L44350 +++$+++ u3709 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
L44349 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
L44348 +++$+++ u3709 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
L44347 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
L44346 +++$+++ u3709 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
L44345 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They gave me a list.
L44344 +++$+++ u3709 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ You got your DP?
L43885 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Ah there's our snookums now.
L43884 +++$+++ u3709 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ You lose this?
L44512 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ It was a mistake.  This isn't a plot to do in Otis.
L44511 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I'm so sorry.
L44510 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Stop being such a bitch, Sal.
L44500 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I think it's great that I made an impression at all, you know.
L44499 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
L44498 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
L44497 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Sorry?
L44496 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
L44495 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I like you.
L44494 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ That's very nice.
L44493 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Come here.
L44492 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
L44491 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You must have been a baby.
L44490 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
L44489 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ How long have you been married?
L44488 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better.
L44487 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ And he doesn't smoke?
L44486 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Yes.
L44485 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ A lot of cakes.
L44484 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Medallions.
L44483 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ That's a lot of those.
L44482 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment.
L44481 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L44480 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank.
L44479 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I think he's really angry with me too.
L44478 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Ryan's really angry with me.
L44477 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Lemon it is.
L44476 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Lemon.
L44475 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Lemon or raspberry?
L44474 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Okay.
L44473 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
L44472 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ What am I, five?
L44471 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Here, drink this.  Drink lots of water.  Hold on to this.  Take deep breaths. Nice and slow.  Would you like a lolly?
L44470 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I'm a little in the puke zone.
L44469 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl.
L44468 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I've never done this before.
L44467 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Let's go for a walk.
L44466 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
L44465 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Are you okay?
L44165 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Sally!!!!
L44164 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I will treasure this.
L44163 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I need to leave you now.
L44161 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ We're way past inappropriate.
L44160 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Would you sign it for me.  I'm sure this is inappropriate.
L44159 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I'll be your best friend.
L44158 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Scout's honor.
L44157 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
L44156 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Easy tiger.
L44154 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh shit.  I'm sorry.  I'm a total fucking maniac.  Delete all that, okay?  I spoke for myself, this needn't rub off on my wife.  Oh shit.  I get pissy sometimes. Much worse than Otis.  Otis doesn't bite. It's just, I really love my dog and he doesn't really bark a lot. We live in a canyon.  We hear dogs barking at night, too.  And it's not Otis.
L44153 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.
L44152 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh shit.  I'm sorry.
L44151 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ And your phone calls are nasty and abusive.  And I've come this close to suing you for harassment.  And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you.
L44150 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ And Ryan works at home.
L44149 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ And you know, he really does not.
L44148 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
L44147 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Elitism?
L44146 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism...
L44145 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What?
L44144 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.
L44143 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Very well put.
L44142 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
L44141 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Hm.
L44140 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
L44139 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No you're not.
L44138 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ A little out of my element.
L44137 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh.
L44136 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I'm a little nervous, so...
L44135 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L44134 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Oh, yes.  You know Ryan's been sober eight years.  And it's difficult if I... you know.  It's better if I don't.
L44133 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
L44132 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
L44131 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
L44130 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Sally did all this herself?
