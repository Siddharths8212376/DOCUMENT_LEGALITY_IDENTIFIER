L124119 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
L124118 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ My pleasure --
L124117 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
L124116 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
L124115 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ You should've done all this before.
L124114 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
L124113 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ It's in the process.
L124112 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
L124111 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ We're waiting on you.
L124109 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ We're waiting for the light to cross the highway.  It just changed.  We're in a grey van.  It reads "<u>Noble Carpet Cleaners</u>."
L124108 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I still don't see you.
L124107 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ I don't know what you mean.
L124106 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
L124105 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ Satisfied?
L124092 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ Talk to the man.
L124091 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
L124090 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ You'll see her.
L124089 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I don't need to relax.  The woman. Put her on.
L124088 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ Just relax.
L124087 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Fucking "A" it is!  Any argument and I'm out of here.
L124086 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ It's your call.
L124085 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.
L124084 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ Stay there.
L124083 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
L124082 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ We don't see you.
L124081 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm here.  Where are you?
L124057 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I wish it had never been invented.
L124056 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
L124055 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot.
L124054 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ 308-9962.
L124053 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Take my number.  When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange.  It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.
L124052 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ Sure.
L124051 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Got a phone in that van?
L124050 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
L124049 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Tell the lady to relax.  Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
L124048 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
L124047 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ Some loyalty.
L124046 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I want you all in one vehicle. Your van.  If I see anybody else cruising around I'll keep going. No second chances.  You can kill them and I'll keep what I've got.
L124045 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ We can be there.
L124044 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
L124043 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ What time frame have you got in mind?
L124042 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
L124041 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ Pass.
L124040 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
L124039 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ Where do we meet?
L124036 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Granted.  But I don't believe they're grieving enough for their chauffeur to piss away their own futures.
L124035 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ There are no guarantees in this life.
L124034 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
L124033 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ Keep talking.
L124032 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison.  He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
L124031 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ You're up on your details, aren't you?
L124030 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ They saw you kill the driver.
L124029 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ You got time on your side.  Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.
L124028 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You're making it too easy.
L124027 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ Whatever you say.
L124026 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.
L124025 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ Twenty percent.
L124024 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
L124023 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ Who are you working for?
L124511 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ Following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend.
L124510 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm in awe.
L124508 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ Nobody can do anything right but you!
L124507 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.
L124506 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ Them.  They won't be expecting us.
L124505 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Who were you talking to?
L124498 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ Stay put!  I know my way around.
L124497 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.
L124495 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ Are you busting my chops or what?
L124494 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
L124493 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ In your dreams.
L124492 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Probably as close to the Getty as I'll ever come.  Unless you care to be my "patron," Nels.  You wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts.
L124491 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ At those prices I'd just as soon your cabbie didn't get a look at me.
L124490 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ None of your business, but it's in the cab.  That's all mine.  When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty.
L124489 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Where's the backpack?
L124488 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
L124487 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them.
L124479 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Believe me.  They couldn't be busier at the moment.
L124478 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ How do you know?
L124477 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ We're gonna get there first.
L124476 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ And make ourselves a hell of a target.
L124475 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together.
L124474 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ Take the Getty Center exit -- make a right onto Cisco.  It'll be a narrow winding road.  You can't miss the house.  It's a mansion built back in '29 -- Spanish -- boarded up since the quake.
L124473 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Where do I turn?
L124472 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ Five minutes.
L124471 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ How far off are you?
L124470 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Take the 405 south.
L124469 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ In the hills above Sunset.  Just below the Getty.
L124466 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Sweet revenge plus maybe a bit of vigorish off your end.
L124465 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  I may need to pry that information out of her.  What do you stand to gain?
L124464 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
L124463 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ I can see the benefit in that.
L124458 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ My compensation!  Somebody still owes me -- big time!
L124457 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
L124456 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
L124455 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
L124454 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I suppose you're in your taxi?
L124453 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ What does it take to kill you?
L124452 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I thought you'd know me by now.
L124451 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ Who's this?
L124450 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
L124449 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ Yeah?
L124354 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You couldn't be calling at a worse time, Nels.
L124353 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
L124352 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Yeah?
L124288 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Then you can sue the cops. Collect from both ends.  Tighten your belts.  Here it comes.  Ready?
L124287 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
L124286 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
L124285 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ You want us to get ourselves killed?
L124284 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Tailgate me.  I'll jam on the brakes.  You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off.
L124283 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ There's two police cars now.
L124282 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You researched me.  You know where I live.  She'll be waiting for you there along with your split.
L124279 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ It's in your interest, Nels, since the additional passenger in my trunk -- an LAPD officer is probably carrying a few bullets in him traceable to the piece you're carrying.  Tell the man.
L124278 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ The fuck I will!
L124277 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.
L124276 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Sure, I end up with some cash. And a lot of bonds I don't know how to dispose of.
L124275 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ And if you ditch us we get zilch.
L124274 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ If he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus Lenore here.
L124262 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I think I've already had a "quickie."  Thank you.
L124261 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
L124260 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
L124259 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ Call me "Nels."
L124258 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Who am I talking to?
L124251 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Better reassure him.
L124250 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ What's he doing?  Answer me!
L124068 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Tell the truth, I was going to take a much needed leak.
L124067 +++$+++ u4397 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ OFFICER GRILLO +++$+++ Was I picking on you?  How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
L124066 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Why are you picking on me for?
L124065 +++$+++ u4397 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ OFFICER GRILLO +++$+++ Mind if I have a look?
L124064 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
L124063 +++$+++ u4397 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ OFFICER GRILLO +++$+++ If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
L124062 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Seems not.
L124061 +++$+++ u4397 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ OFFICER GRILLO +++$+++ Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
L124060 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Since when did you guys start changing tires?
L124013 +++$+++ u4400 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Let her tell you.
L124012 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
L124011 +++$+++ u4400 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Hold on.
L124010 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
L124009 +++$+++ u4400 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ There's no lady here.
L124008 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Let me talk to the lady again.
L124007 +++$+++ u4400 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Who are you?
L124006 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Don't be afraid to say hello. Your friend with the recent transplant is in no condition to deliver that briefcase.  So I've taken on the task.
L124485 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ From here on, I dish it out.
L124484 +++$+++ u4399 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ TRUCKER +++$+++ You sure know how to take a lot of punishment.
L124483 +++$+++ u4399 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ TRUCKER +++$+++ Who the fuck you kidding?  Send me money!
L124482 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Let's have your name and address. The government will want to send you a letter of commendation.
L124468 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up?
L124467 +++$+++ u4399 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ TRUCKER +++$+++ The 405 is coming up.
L124462 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.
L124461 +++$+++ u4399 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ TRUCKER +++$+++ I thought so.
L124460 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Undercover.
L124459 +++$+++ u4399 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ TRUCKER +++$+++ What kind of Treasury Dept. business is this?
L124448 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Very official.  259-7881, if I recall.
L124447 +++$+++ u4399 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ TRUCKER +++$+++ Government business?
L124446 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Can I make a quick call?
L124440 +++$+++ u4399 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ TRUCKER +++$+++ Doesn't everybody?
L124439 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You've got a <u>phone</u>?
L124438 +++$+++ u4399 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ TRUCKER +++$+++ I already called for an ambulance.
L125370 +++$+++ u4401 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ COL +++$+++ Whatever you say.
L125369 +++$+++ u4405 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ FERGUS +++$+++ She's not a girl, Col --
L125368 +++$+++ u4401 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ COL +++$+++ When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
L125367 +++$+++ u4405 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ FERGUS +++$+++ How?
L125366 +++$+++ u4401 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ COL +++$+++ You could always make it up to her.
L125182 +++$+++ u4405 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ FERGUS +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L125181 +++$+++ u4401 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ COL +++$+++ She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself.
L125001 +++$+++ u4401 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ COL +++$+++ Who knows the secrets of the human heart.
L125000 +++$+++ u4405 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ FERGUS +++$+++ Then why doesn't she?
L124999 +++$+++ u4401 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ COL +++$+++ He's what she should run a mile from.
L124998 +++$+++ u4405 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ FERGUS +++$+++ So who's he?
L124997 +++$+++ u4401 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ COL +++$+++ It takes all types.
L124970 +++$+++ u4405 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ FERGUS +++$+++ Thanks.
L124969 +++$+++ u4401 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ COL +++$+++ So let's call this the usual.
L124968 +++$+++ u4401 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ COL +++$+++ Well, you get to say, The usual, Col. Things like that.
L124967 +++$+++ u4405 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ FERGUS +++$+++ Is that good or bad?
L124966 +++$+++ u4401 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ COL +++$+++ So can we consider you a regular, sir?
L124950 +++$+++ u4405 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ FERGUS +++$+++ Yeah.
L124949 +++$+++ u4401 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ COL +++$+++ Scottish?
L125363 +++$+++ u4404 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ DIL +++$+++ Fucking men, Col --
L125362 +++$+++ u4401 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ COL +++$+++ Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
L125361 +++$+++ u4404 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ DIL +++$+++ Fuck it, is what I say.
L125360 +++$+++ u4401 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ COL +++$+++ Saw it, Dil.
