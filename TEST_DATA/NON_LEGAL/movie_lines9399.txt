L532724 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Anybody call?
L532706 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?

L533584 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?

L533582 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
L533581 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch.
L533574 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ The Germans know where Dunbar is.
L533573 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Are we going to stand around here and listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
L533531 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Where. Up Joey's ocarina. Didn't you know?
L533530 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Stop that, will you!  Those idiots! So they sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He's still in the compound, isn't he? How long can he last? Where can they hide him?
L533529 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Amazing, what you can do with five thousand ping-pong balls, isn't it?
L533528 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ What did you say?
L533527 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Ach so!
L533526 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ A lot of people say that and the first thing you know is they get married and live happily ever after.  I wonder what they're trying to pull out there?
L533525 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
L533524 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.
L533523 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Are you questioning me?

L533519 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
L533518 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
L533517 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
L533516 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Or how about a game of pinochle? No, you're not a pinochle man. You're a chess player.  I haven't played since I was a kid. Let's see --  -- a pawn moves this way, doesn't it? And a bishop this way? And the queen -- every which way, doesn't it?
L533251 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ What about the radio?
L533250 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ So was the radio private property. So was Manfredi and Johnson.
L533030 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.
L533029 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.
L532908 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ I'll tell you how come.  The Barrack Chief gave them the green light. And you, our Security Officer, said it'd be safe. That's how come.
L532907 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.
L532906 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ And what's that crack supposed to mean?
L532905 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ I wasn't so sure. I just liked the odds.
L532904 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
L532903 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Now you've done it. You've given me nervous indigestion.  Anything else bothering you, boys?

L533445 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Wie hat er's gemacht?
L533444 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Ich weiss alles.
L533443 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
L533186 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
L533185 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ We have no radio.
L533184 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Give me the radio.
L533183 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Schulz, you're off your nut!
L532968 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ You are trying to say that an American would inform on other Americans?
L532967 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Which one of us is the informer?
L532786 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Ja, ja, gewiss! It is only that we are cramped for space with new prisoners every day.  Gentlemen! Outside! Please! Do you want me to have trouble with the Kommandant again!
L532785 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
L532784 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
L532756 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.
L532755 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
L533439 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Not particularly.
L533438 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
L533307 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ How many do you want? A thousand?
L533306 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Talk what? I do not know anything!
L533305 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ You'd better talk, Schulz, because I'm going to find out with you or without you. Because I won't let go for a second. Because they'll have to kill me to stop me. So talk!
L533304 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ No! No!
L533303 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ I'll make it five hundred!
L533302 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Yes, you do!
L533301 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ I do not want those cigarettes.
L533300 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
L533299 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ What guy?
L533298 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Who's the guy, Schulz?
L533297 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
L533296 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?
L533295 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village --
L533294 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Here. Take them.
L533293 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
L533292 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
L533291 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
L532972 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ You Americans! You are the craziest people! That's why I like you! I wish I could invite you all to my house for a nice German Christmas!
L532971 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ No use, Schulz. You might as well come clean. Why don't you just tell 'em it's me. Because I'm really the illegitimate son of Hitler. And after the Germans win the war you'll make me the Gauleiter of Zinzinnati.
L532783 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Fine -- fine!
L532782 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
L532781 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Good morning, Sefton.
L533192 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?
L533191 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ My grandmother's ear-muffs.
L533178 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ The Kommandant also sends you clean blankets. He wants every man to have a new, clean blanket.
L533177 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
L533176 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
L532960 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ It is not me. It is the orders. I am your friend. I am your best friend here.
L532959 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other.
L532958 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ All right, gentlemen! We will now all go outside for a little gymnastic and take some shovels and undig the tunnel which you digged.
L532955 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Give it back. You must not arouse yourselves.
L532954 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
L532953 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ That is my wife.
L532952 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
L532951 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ This is me in Cincinnati.
L532947 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Always joking. Always making wisecrackers!
L532946 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
L532945 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
L532792 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!
L532791 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
L532788 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Russian women prisoners?
L532787 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Hey, Schulz -- as long as you're going to move somebody in -- how about a couple of those Russian broads?
L533617 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Tell you what to do. First, get yourself a hundred cigarettes for the Kraut guards. Then get yourself another face.
L533616 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ You're not disposing of those Russian broads?
L533596 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Okay, Herr Preismaier, let's have the mail box.
L533595 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ You heard him.
L533316 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
L533315 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ So you're stuck with me, eh?
L533244 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Oh! Somebody was peeking!
L533243 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Have a nice time over there?
L533056 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
L533055 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ You must have been some tail gunner!  Go ahead, Cookie.
L532893 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
L532892 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
L532883 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Just don't drool on it.
L532882 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Is it all right if we smell it?
L532878 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ A chicken?
L532877 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ From a chicken, bug-wit.
L545913 +++$+++ u2897 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ B'ETOR +++$+++ Full disruptors.
L545912 +++$+++ u2905 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ LURSA +++$+++ Target their Bridge.
L545882 +++$+++ u2897 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ B'ETOR +++$+++ I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!
L545881 +++$+++ u2905 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ LURSA +++$+++ Where is he now?
L545872 +++$+++ u2897 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ B'ETOR +++$+++ Then when is he going to Engineering?
L545871 +++$+++ u2905 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ LURSA +++$+++ He is.
L545870 +++$+++ u2897 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ B'ETOR +++$+++ I thought he was the Chief Engineer.
L545860 +++$+++ u2897 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ B'ETOR +++$+++ Where is he?
L545859 +++$+++ u2905 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ LURSA +++$+++ It's working.
L545849 +++$+++ u2905 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ LURSA +++$+++ We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
L545848 +++$+++ u2897 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ B'ETOR +++$+++ The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.
L545692 +++$+++ u2905 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ LURSA +++$+++ HoS qorDu. 
L545691 +++$+++ u2897 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ B'ETOR +++$+++ Toh-pak-cha=8A 
L545378 +++$+++ u2903 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, well, congratulations, Ensign. It wouldn't be the Enterprise without a Sulu at the helm.

L545376 +++$+++ u2903 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than...
L545358 +++$+++ u2903 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final.
L545357 +++$+++ u2898 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ Captain=8A
L545353 +++$+++ u2898 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ Captain. Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony.
L545352 +++$+++ u2903 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Tomorrow I want to make a tri-elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry.
L545349 +++$+++ u2903 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Thanks for pointing that out.
L545348 +++$+++ u2898 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way.
L545833 +++$+++ u2906 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ I have to find a way to get to Soran.
L545832 +++$+++ u2899 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.
L545828 +++$+++ u2899 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Sorry, sir.  There is too much interference in the planet's ionosphere for an accurate reading.
L545827 +++$+++ u2906 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Commander.
L545826 +++$+++ u2899 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ "Lifeforms tiny little lifeforms. Where are the lifeforms-"

L545801 +++$+++ u2906 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Population?
L545800 +++$+++ u2899 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
L545799 +++$+++ u2906 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Are any of them inhabited?
L545798 +++$+++ u2906 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ And destroy every planet in the system.
L545797 +++$+++ u2899 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
L545796 +++$+++ u2906 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ That's where he's going.
L545793 +++$+++ u2899 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Yes, sir. There are two in the Veridian system.
L545792 +++$+++ u2906 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him.  Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
L545789 +++$+++ u2899 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ I believe so.
L545788 +++$+++ u2906 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
L545785 +++$+++ u2899 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ I believe so.
L545784 +++$+++ u2906 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Courage is an emotion too, Data.  Now, can you project the course of the ribbon?
L545781 +++$+++ u2906 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Can you project its course?
L545780 +++$+++ u2899 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ This is its current position.
L545778 +++$+++ u2899 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ The destruction of the Amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout the sector. Any ship passing through this region will have to make a minor course correction.
L545777 +++$+++ u2906 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
L545776 +++$+++ u2899 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-
L545775 +++$+++ u2899 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
L545774 +++$+++ u2906 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
L545773 +++$+++ u2899 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
L545772 +++$+++ u2906 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
L545771 +++$+++ u2899 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect.  I believe it was fear.
L545770 +++$+++ u2906 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ What do you mean?
L545769 +++$+++ u2899 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
L545768 +++$+++ u2906 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Data, are you all right?
L545767 +++$+++ u2899 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.
L545766 +++$+++ u2906 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
L545765 +++$+++ u2899 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
L545764 +++$+++ u2906 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
L545763 +++$+++ u2899 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Sorry, Captain. The ribbon has already entered the galaxy. It will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours.
L545762 +++$+++ u2906 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Data?
L545761 +++$+++ u2906 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ When is it expected back?
L545760 +++$+++ u2899 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
L545926 +++$+++ u2899 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ One minute to warp core breach.
L545925 +++$+++ u2904 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ LA FORGE +++$+++ That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
L545639 +++$+++ u2904 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ LA FORGE +++$+++ We better get you back to the ship  La Forge to Enterprise.
L545638 +++$+++ u2899 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
L545637 +++$+++ u2904 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ LA FORGE +++$+++ Data, are you all right?
L545635 +++$+++ u2899 +++$+++ m191 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ I am sorry, but I cannot stop myself. I think something is wrong
