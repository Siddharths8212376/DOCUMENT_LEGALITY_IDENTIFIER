L245819 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You're nothing to me now, Fredo; not a brother, not a friend, I don't want to know you, or what happens to you.  I don't want to see you at the hotels, or near my home.  When you visit our Mother, I want to know a day in advance, so I won't be there.  Do you understand?
L245818 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.
L245817 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
L245816 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I can handle things.  I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.
L245815 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It's the way Pop wanted it.
L245814 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my.  Did you ever think of that. Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.  Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!
L245813 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I've always taken care of you.
L245812 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
L245811 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ And you believed that story.
L245810 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ I didn't know it was a hit.  I swear to you I didn't know.  Johnny Ola contacted me in Beverly Hills -- said he wanted to talk.  He said you and Roth were in on some big deal, and there was a place for me in it if I could help them out. They said you were being tough on the negotiation, and if they had a little bit of help, they could close it fast and it would be good for you.
L245809 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ I know they get Pentangeli, that's all I know.
L245808 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
L245807 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
L245806 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ We have time.
L245805 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ I don't have a lot to say, Michael.
L245619 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Nowhere, Mike.  I wanted to get a refill.  How about you?
L245618 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Fredo.  Where are you going?
L245614 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ The old man will never bring in the New Year.
L245613 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ What is it?  Can I help?
L245612 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move.
L245611 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ What do you want me to do?
L245610 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that.  It was Roth all along.  He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.
L245609 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ But, you told me yourself...
L245608 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
L245607 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ ...Who?
L245606 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.
L245605 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
L245604 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
L245603 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
L245602 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
L245601 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ What's that?
L245600 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ &quot;Yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot; I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms...
L245599 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ You know her; drives me crazy, one minute she's a popsicle, the next she's all vinegar.  Sometimes I think... I think - I should a married someone, like you did.  To have kids, to have a family.
L245598 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ How is your wife, Fredo...your marriage?
L245580 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Me?  NO, no, I don't know anything. Fellas!  You're all falling asleep. We got to see Superman.
L245579 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You know otherwise, Freddie?
L245578 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ No.  I mean, are you sure?
L245577 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
L245576 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
L245575 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It was hard to have him killed.
L245574 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
L245573 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It was hard to have him killed.
L245572 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Mikey, why would they ever hit poor old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember when he was just a 'button,' when we were kids.  We used to put bedsheets on our heads, you know, like we were ghosts.  An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember?
L245571 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Wait'll you see!
L245570 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No.
L245569 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Mike, I got something special up my sleeve for these boys.  You ever hear of &quot;Superman?&quot; And I don't mean the comic book.
L245561 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I never looked down on you, Fredo. You don't look down at a brother.
L245560 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Jeeze, it's great you came along, Mike... You know, we've never spent a night out on the town together. I always thought you looked down on me for liking a good time.
L245531 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Me and you, great!  Gimme an hour to wash my face and do my research and we'll have these Washington suckers right where you want 'em.  Poor Frankie Five-Angels.  He always wanted to die in bed...with a broad.
L245530 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.
L245529 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Count on me; that's my specialty.
L245528 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
L245527 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ That's what I'm here for.
L245526 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I want you to help me, Fredo.
L245525 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
L245524 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers.  Didn't you know that?
L245523 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ I never met them.
L245522 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
L245521 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Great, Havana's great.  Lots of activity in Havana!  Anybody I know here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?
L245520 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ We're making an investment in Havana.
L245519 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
L245518 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It's all right.  He stays with me all the time.
L245517 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Oh, 'scuse me.
L245515 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Mio fratello.
L245514 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Hiya, Freddie Corleone.
L245068 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Forget it, just go take care of her.
L245067 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Hey Mike, what can I say?
L245677 +++$+++ u5539 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ GENCO +++$+++ Roberto.  Who owns the 'rat-holes.'
L245676 +++$+++ u5559 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ VITO +++$+++ Chi?
L245675 +++$+++ u5539 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ GENCO +++$+++ The 'patrone' is here.
L245115 +++$+++ u5539 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ GENCO +++$+++ He took the money.  Now he wants double from everybody in the neighborhood, including Papa.
L245114 +++$+++ u5559 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ VITO +++$+++  And he agreed?
L245113 +++$+++ u5539 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ GENCO +++$+++ What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.
L245111 +++$+++ u5539 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ GENCO +++$+++ Because he's what we say... &quot;connected&quot;... You wait, see what happens to those guys from Ninth Avenue.
L245110 +++$+++ u5559 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ VITO +++$+++ Why?
L245109 +++$+++ u5539 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ GENCO +++$+++ I wish they had.  He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.
L245108 +++$+++ u5559 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ VITO +++$+++ In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
L245107 +++$+++ u5539 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ GENCO +++$+++ Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
L245106 +++$+++ u5559 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ VITO +++$+++ No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?
L245105 +++$+++ u5539 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ GENCO +++$+++ Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
L245104 +++$+++ u5559 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ VITO +++$+++ What?
L245103 +++$+++ u5539 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ GENCO +++$+++ I bet you can't guess what happened?
L245102 +++$+++ u5539 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ GENCO +++$+++ I know.  That's why I brought you with me!
L245101 +++$+++ u5559 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ VITO +++$+++ For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
L245100 +++$+++ u5539 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ GENCO +++$+++ Beautiful.
L245099 +++$+++ u5559 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ VITO +++$+++ Beautiful.
L245098 +++$+++ u5539 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ GENCO +++$+++ Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel?
L245097 +++$+++ u5559 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ VITO +++$+++ Why?  Why does he bother other Italians?
L245096 +++$+++ u5539 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ GENCO +++$+++ A pig of a Neaponitan. 
L245095 +++$+++ u5559 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ VITO +++$+++ He's an Italian?
L245094 +++$+++ u5539 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ GENCO +++$+++ I know what you are thinking, Vitone, but you don't understand yet how things are.  Fanucci is of the Black Hand.  Everyone in the neighborhood pays him, even my father.
L245482 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ I don't know.  I hope soon; but it's not over yet, and that's why you and the kids have to come back to me.
L245481 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
L245480 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ If you told Michael what I've told you today, I'm a dead man.
L245479 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ What the hell does that mean?  Come on, Tom, speak out straight once in your life.  I know Michael can't, but you're not Sicilian, you can tell a woman the truth; you can treat her like an equal, a fellow human being.
L245478 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
L245477 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ He's not the same as when I met him.
L245476 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
L245475 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.
L245474 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
L245473 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
L245472 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Kay... Kay...
L245471 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ ... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden.  And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge.  How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?
L245279 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ That's not the way we look at it.
L245278 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Am I a prisoner?
L245277 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
L245276 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ How long does this go on?
L245275 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
L245274 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I'm going to see my parents.
L245273 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ That's off now.
L245272 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
L245271 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Within the compound will be fine.
L245270 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I'm supposed to stay in my house.
L245269 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ It's Michael's request...for your safety.  We can send out for anything you need.
L245902 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ I don't know.
L245901 +++$+++ u5554 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Will you tell him?
L245900 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Yes.
L245899 +++$+++ u5554 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ You're going to talk to him now.
L245407 +++$+++ u5554 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.
L245406 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Why didn't someone tell me!
L245405 +++$+++ u5554 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago.
L245404 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ What do you mean gone?
L245403 +++$+++ u5554 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ She's gone, Tom.
L245402 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Hello?
L244995 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ It's as though he blames me for the ground the family lost when I was Consigliere to Sonny.
L244994 +++$+++ u5554 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.
L244993 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Just now when Johnny Ola showed up, he asked me to leave them alone. Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian contact.  I was on the inside of ten, twenty meetings with him.  But today Mike asked me to leave, like an outsider.
L244992 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ I can feel it in the way he talks to me.
L244991 +++$+++ u5554 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ We don't know that's true, he never said that.
L244990 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it.
L244988 +++$+++ u5554 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ With Mama, putting the baby to sleep.  Francesca's very happy. Michael was kind to her.  She idolizes him.  The children are all out in the speedboat.  I'm going to my house.
L244987 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Where's my wife?
L245418 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Yeah, give me a minute.
L245417 +++$+++ u5550 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ Me too, Tom?
L245415 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ I can't let him down.
L245414 +++$+++ u5550 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ She took a flight to San Francisco. We figure she's going to connect to New Hampshire; her parents' place.
L245412 +++$+++ u5550 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ I was in my house.  Willy tried, but it would have taken some strong-arm to stop her, and he figured you wouldn't want that.
L245411 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Goddamn it, where were you?
L245410 +++$+++ u5550 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.
L245409 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Rocco!
L245923 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ I'm staying.  Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of all this; Sonny never listened to me about that.  Now, explain everything to me.
L245922 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Good.  Then you're staying.
L245921 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.
L245920 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
L245919 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.
L245918 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ They are everywhere!
L245917 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
L245916 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill...  ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all?
L245915 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Mike, it would be like trying to kill the President; there's no way we can get to him.
L245914 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I don't like it when you use the word impossible; nothing is impossible...
L245913 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.
L245912 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I want it met.
L245911 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ That plane goes to Miami...
L245910 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
L245909 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
L245908 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.
L245905 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ I know he's in Israel.
L245904 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Sit down, Tom.  Have you heard about our friend and partner, Mr. Hyman Roth?
L245804 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Alright.  I'm going to go outside and talk to Fredo.
L245803 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ He says he doesn't know anything, and I believe him.  Roth played this one beautifully.
L245800 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.
L245799 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?
L245742 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ I don't know.
L245741 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
L245740 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ She took the Senate Investigation worse.
L245739 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ And Kay...she's all right?
L245738 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ It was a boy.
L245737 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
L245736 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Mike, at three and a half...
L245735 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Was it a boy or a girl?
L245734 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
L245733 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Go on, tell me.
L245732 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Alright.
L245731 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Wait... there's something else.
L245730 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ They can come in now.
L245729 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.
L245728 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him.
L245727 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam.  The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York.
L245726 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I asked about Fredo?
L245725 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.
L245724 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Where's my brother?
L245722 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ A little care he can ride in with an electric motor.
L245721 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What was it, so I'll know.
L245720 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ I took care of it.
L245719 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?
L245716 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.
L245715 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?
L245237 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ If I'm wrong...
L245236 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ But if you're wrong...
L245235 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
L245234 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
L245233 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
L245231 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No Tom, just listen.  All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.
L245230 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Mikey, I hoped...
L245229 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No, I have confidence in their loyalty... but this is life and death, and Tom, you are my brother.
L245228 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...
L245227 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom. I know that's upset you in the past; and you've felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.  But it is because I do trust you that I've kept so much secret from you.  It's precisely that at this moment, you are the only one that I can completely trust.  In time, you'll understand everything.
L244971 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
L244970 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ If you need anything, just...
L244969 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Sure, Mikey.
