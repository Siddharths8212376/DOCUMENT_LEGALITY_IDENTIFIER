L469278 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ But it's not a great syllable
L469277 +++$+++ u2550 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MANK +++$+++ Craig is one syllable
L469276 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I

L469274 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that?
L469273 +++$+++ u2550 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MANK +++$+++ The title?
L469272 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
L469271 +++$+++ u2550 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MANK +++$+++ What?
L469270 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping, of course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . . exactly . . .
L469269 +++$+++ u2550 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MANK +++$+++ It's good, huh?
L469266 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It is 350 pages of ... ABSOLUTE INSPIRATION!
L469265 +++$+++ u2550 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MANK +++$+++ Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
L469264 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It's 350 pages long.
L469231 +++$+++ u2550 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MANK +++$+++ And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
L469230 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.
L469229 +++$+++ u2550 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MANK +++$+++ And what does he see?
L469228 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Hearst looks down at the world at his feet Everything has always been beneath him.
L469227 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ He loves in his own way. On his conditions. Because those are the only conditions he has ever known.

L469225 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ All men love. But men like Hearst -- they don't bother with convention because--
L469220 +++$+++ u2550 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MANK +++$+++ She was . . . innocent
L469219 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Why her?
L469218 +++$+++ u2550 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MANK +++$+++ This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
L469217 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're dying. What's the last image that comes to you? Right now.
L469215 +++$+++ u2550 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MANK +++$+++ Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated.

L469203 +++$+++ u2550 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MANK +++$+++ And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
L469202 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It doesn't have to be
L469201 +++$+++ u2550 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MANK +++$+++ When I was a kid I wanted to scorch the world too - - I had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories. But all that's finished for me--

L469194 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ --Because he has been so furiously busy wasting himself. Amusing his keepers. Because he is a sycophant! Because he has been thrown out of every studio in Hollywood and no one will hire him because he's a drunk- -!
L469193 +++$+++ u2550 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MANK +++$+++ Don't do this
L469192 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years--
L469191 +++$+++ u2550 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MANK +++$+++ Don't do this
L469190 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I remember a man who wrote I He was a brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and insight--
L469188 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ How does it feel, Mank? Going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table? How does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves--?!
L469187 +++$+++ u2550 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MANK +++$+++ Sorry to disappoint.

L469183 +++$+++ u2550 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MANK +++$+++ You may think you know what you're talking about, kid, but believe me, you don't. You're talking about going into a battle you can never win on a battlefield so far above things like movies and Hollywood that Hearst won't even have to glance down when he crushes you. When he flicks you away with one finger. I'm talking about money and influence and evil beyond your capacity to imagine Hell.
L469182 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ We're doing Hearst.
L469181 +++$+++ u2550 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MANK +++$+++ Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.

L469113 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ He's nothing but a hypocrite. He preaches morality every day in his sordid little papers for everyone else in the world but he lives openly with his mistress.

L469082 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ No, it's perfect! When in doubt, put on a cape! False noses and faux beards and flowing capes have been the life-blood of the actor's craft since the days of lrving and Booth.

L469055 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Not for me.
L469054 +++$+++ u2550 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MANK +++$+++ Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.

L469745 +++$+++ u2554 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ This isn' t some kinda fucking game! You know how many people RKO employs?! You know how many people depend on what we do for a living?!

L469673 +++$+++ u2554 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing with the stockholders in New York who are scared shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll do what I can to--
