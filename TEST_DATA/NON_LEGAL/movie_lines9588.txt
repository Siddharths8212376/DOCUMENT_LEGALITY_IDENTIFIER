L74530 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I feel naked without it.
L74529 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
L74528 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
L74527 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
L74520 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.
L74519 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
L74518 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ What if I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one?
L74517 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ You're one man. You can't save everybody.
L74516 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
L74515 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. As Bruce Wayne.
L74514 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ No one would miss me.
L74513 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
L74477 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !
L74476 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
L74475 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ ... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
L74474 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing.
L74459 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ I wish you'd...
L74458 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
L74457 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
L74456 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
L74455 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
L74454 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I know it's late. I -- Are you there?
L74283 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ ... Looks like a convention.
L74282 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ All street mimes should be executed.
L74279 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ Mm-hmm.  Lunch.  Not even dinner.
L74278 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.
L74277 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.
L74257 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is -- Now you'll have to kill me.
L74256 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I don't sing very well.
L74238 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ ... We could try that.
L74237 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Maybe we should just kiss.
L74236 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
L74235 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I'll take you home if you'd like.
L74234 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --
L74233 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it.  Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it.
L74232 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ I'm sorry, Bruce, I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.
L74231 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I see.  If I know how you really feel, I won't like you as much.
L74230 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
L74229 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
L74228 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
L74226 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
L74225 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ There's terror everywhere.  If you train yourself to look for it.
L74224 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ ... Terror.
L74223 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ What did you see?
L74222 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ Well.  A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice.  And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio.  Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.
L74221 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Odd desire for anyone.
L74220 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
L74219 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ No.
L74218 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
L74217 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops.  Look, I bore myself silly.  Let's talk about you. How the hell did you wind up in Corto Maltese?
L74215 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.
L74214 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ Do you sail?
L74165 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Good.  With any luck we'll run into each other.
L74164 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ As far as I know.
L74163 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I don't... seek publicity -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while?
L74585 +++$+++ u3945 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ DENT +++$+++ I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I don't have access to all you expert sources.
L74584 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
L74583 +++$+++ u3945 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ DENT +++$+++ We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
L74582 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
L74581 +++$+++ u3945 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ DENT +++$+++ Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne -- We do have laws.
L74580 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I suggest a nice big bomb.
L74579 +++$+++ u3945 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ DENT +++$+++ All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
L74578 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
L74577 +++$+++ u3945 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ DENT +++$+++ We'll raid the Ace the moment we get a warrant.
L74557 +++$+++ u3946 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ It's a detour. They're backed up for blocks!
L74556 +++$+++ u3951 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JOKER +++$+++ MOVE! Can't you do something??
L74555 +++$+++ u3951 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JOKER +++$+++ They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT!
L74554 +++$+++ u3946 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ Boss! Jesus! They've --
L74553 +++$+++ u3946 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ WHAT??
L74552 +++$+++ u3951 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JOKER +++$+++ SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
L74551 +++$+++ u3946 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ WHAT?
L74550 +++$+++ u3951 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JOKER +++$+++ SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
L74382 +++$+++ u3951 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JOKER +++$+++ Take 'em! I want his head!
L74381 +++$+++ u3946 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ We got 'em!
L74093 +++$+++ u3947 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ ECKHARDT +++$+++ About how pretty you are, pretty boy.  Maybe he'd like to know --
L74092 +++$+++ u3950 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L74091 +++$+++ u3947 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ ECKHARDT +++$+++ Got it all figured, huh?  Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.  -- Maybe he don't know what we know.
L74090 +++$+++ u3950 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
L74089 +++$+++ u3947 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ ECKHARDT +++$+++ I answer to Grissom, punk.  Not to you.
L74088 +++$+++ u3950 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Eckhardt... our problems are your problems.
L74087 +++$+++ u3947 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ ECKHARDT +++$+++ I'm on top of it.  If there's a problem --
L74086 +++$+++ u3950 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Don't let your job interfere with your business.  -- Someone's been talking to Harvey Dent.
L74085 +++$+++ u3947 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ ECKHARDT +++$+++ Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
L74084 +++$+++ u3950 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I missed you, Lieutenant.
L74058 +++$+++ u3954 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Do you want this money or don't you?  Now shut up!  Shut up --
L74057 +++$+++ u3948 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man.  You shouldn'ta --
L74056 +++$+++ u3954 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ No wonder you're such a chickenshit.  Now shut up.  There ain't no bat.
L74055 +++$+++ u3948 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ My brother's a priest, man.
L74054 +++$+++ u3954 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ God!  How old are you?  There ain't no bat.
L74053 +++$+++ u3948 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ There was no blood, man.  My brother says... all the bad things you done... they come back and haunt you...
L74052 +++$+++ u3954 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ No shit.  It was all over the pavement.
L74051 +++$+++ u3948 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
L74050 +++$+++ u3954 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
L74049 +++$+++ u3948 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
L74048 +++$+++ u3954 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  No big loss.
L74047 +++$+++ u3948 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -
L74046 +++$+++ u3954 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What are you, scared of heights?
L74045 +++$+++ u3948 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Let's beat it, man.  I don't like it up here.
L74253 +++$+++ u3950 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ HA!  That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
L74252 +++$+++ u3949 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ GRISSOM +++$+++ Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
L74251 +++$+++ u3950 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
L74250 +++$+++ u3949 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ GRISSOM +++$+++ Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
L74249 +++$+++ u3950 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I've died once already.  It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it.
L74248 +++$+++ u3949 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ GRISSOM +++$+++ It's not the girl, Jack.  Sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.
L74246 +++$+++ u3950 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Is that what you "heard"?
L74245 +++$+++ u3949 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ GRISSOM +++$+++ Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --
L74244 +++$+++ u3950 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It's me.  "Sugar Bumps."
L74128 +++$+++ u3949 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ GRISSOM +++$+++ Oh, Jack.  -- Don't forget your lucky deck.
L74127 +++$+++ u3950 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I understand.
L74126 +++$+++ u3949 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ GRISSOM +++$+++ Because I want someone I can trust.
L74125 +++$+++ u3950 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?
L74122 +++$+++ u3949 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ GRISSOM +++$+++ Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
L74121 +++$+++ u3950 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."
L74274 +++$+++ u3951 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JOKER +++$+++ That's it.
L74273 +++$+++ u3955 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ ROTELLI +++$+++ That's it?
L74272 +++$+++ u3951 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JOKER +++$+++ Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
L74271 +++$+++ u3955 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ ROTELLI +++$+++ And what happens if we say no?
L74270 +++$+++ u3951 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JOKER +++$+++ I've considered that possibility.
L74269 +++$+++ u3955 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ ROTELLI +++$+++ I don't like taking orders from Grissom. And I especially don't like taking orders from Grissom's goon.
L74495 +++$+++ u3951 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JOKER +++$+++ Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
L74494 +++$+++ u3953 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
L74493 +++$+++ u3951 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JOKER +++$+++ Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
L74492 +++$+++ u3953 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
L74490 +++$+++ u3951 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JOKER +++$+++ Huh. Demands. Well, gents, this is kinda embarrassing, but... I'm having such a swell time, I just haven't thought any up.
L74489 +++$+++ u3953 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
L74488 +++$+++ u3951 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JOKER +++$+++ Joker here. Can we talk?
L74359 +++$+++ u3951 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JOKER +++$+++ Miss Vale, was it something I said?  Do you want to sniff my flower?
L74358 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
L74357 +++$+++ u3951 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JOKER +++$+++ What?  I improved her a little...
L74356 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
L74355 +++$+++ u3951 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JOKER +++$+++ Alicia!  Come here, have a seat.  Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask.
L74354 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ ... Why the mask?
L74349 +++$+++ u3951 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JOKER +++$+++ Strong stomach, huh?  I like that in a woman -- Maybe we can do business after all.
L74348 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ I've seen worse.  Much worse.
L74347 +++$+++ u3951 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JOKER +++$+++ ... Behind the makeup?
L74346 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist.  People might like to see the face behind the makeup.
L74345 +++$+++ u3951 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JOKER +++$+++ A visual record, yes.  A before-and- after kind of thing.  This could make your reputation.
L74344 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ And you want a --
L74343 +++$+++ u3951 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JOKER +++$+++ Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it.
L74342 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ ... Thank you.
L74636 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Holy shit. Holy...
L74635 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
L74634 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
L74633 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ You okay?
L74632 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ HOLY SHIT!!
L74626 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Great. How??
L74625 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!  Allies -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him!
L74620 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ What do you say? Let's head for the lights.
L74619 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ Yeah. Deja vu.
L74618 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A girl could get hurt this way.
L74468 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ It's gone.
L74467 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
L74466 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
L74465 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope.  CRAZY BAT-STARD!
L74464 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ He's not crazy.
L74463 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Not what?
L74462 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ Allie, he's not.
L74461 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ The guy's bats all right. He's bat shit crazy. He --  -- I can't believe it. I was right!!
L74310 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
L74309 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
L74308 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Right.  And they know him.  And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
L74307 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ Alexander... I know you.
L74306 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ ... Okay, then, I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.
L74305 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.
L74304 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ ... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?
L74303 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
L74302 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
L74301 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ Are they paying you for all this?
L74300 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
L74299 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ You are on drugs.
L74298 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Something like this -- what do you suppose this could drive a guy to?
