L551388 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ My God.
L551387 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little OD won't surprise anybody. It's the only way we can be together.  You know it's true.
L551385 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.
L551384 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Jesus.
L551383 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
L551382 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You can't just... kill him.
L551381 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ What're you going to do?
L551380 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
L551379 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
L551378 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead.
L551300 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ What a nightmare.
L551299 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
L551298 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You think Tran killed her?
L551297 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
L551296 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
L551286 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ No.  Mace is in this.
L551285 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ We should talk alone.
L551284 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
L551283 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Oh God, Lenny.  I was trying to keep you out of this.
L551282 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
L551281 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ What's going on?
L551048 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Tell me.
L551047 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You don't know what you're fucking with here.
L551046 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
L551045 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
L551044 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
L551043 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Who did it?
L551042 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Iris is dead.  She was murdered.
L551041 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.
L550969 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You know one of the ways movies still have Squid beat?  Because they always say "The End." You always know when it's over.  It's over! Now please leave.  I have to go on again in a couple of minutes.
L550968 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Can't do it.
L550967 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
L550966 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
L550965 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
L550964 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ It's you up on that stage, not him. You don't need him.
L550963 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Damn right.
L550962 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing.  You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it.  And you will.
L550961 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Come on, Faith!  He's just toying with you.  And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers.
L550960 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Maybe.
L550959 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ What?  He gonna record you on his label?
L550958 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ He has his uses too.
L550957 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
L550956 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ That's a good one, coming from you.
L550955 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
L550954 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
L550953 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
L550952 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
L550951 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Tonight.
L550950 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You talked to Iris?  When?
L550949 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
L550948 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You have to go.  I mean it.
L550947 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I'm already hurting.
L550946 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
L550945 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Hi, baby.  I've missed you.
L550933 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ No, Lenny.
L550932 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Faith, call me, okay?
L550926 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I just got to talk to you for one second.
L550925 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
L550920 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
L550919 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Cut it out, Tran.
L550881 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Make me forget it, baby.
L550880 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Forget it's there.
L550879 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
L550878 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
L550877 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
L550736 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Watch and see.
L550735 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
L550773 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--
L550772 +++$+++ u3056 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ KEITH +++$+++ Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?
L550769 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Step into my office.
L550768 +++$+++ u3056 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ KEITH +++$+++ What?  Right Here?
L550767 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
L550766 +++$+++ u3056 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ KEITH +++$+++ Talk to me about costs, here.
L550765 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
L550764 +++$+++ u3056 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ KEITH +++$+++ Sounds good.
L550761 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Exactly anything.  Whatever you want.  Whoever you want to be.  Fabri, get us another round, would you.
L550760 +++$+++ u3056 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ KEITH +++$+++ What kind of things exactly?
L550759 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ That's right.  Clips.  Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here.  This isn't like TV only better.  This is life.  It's a piece of somebody's life.  Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex.  You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it.
L550758 +++$+++ u3056 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ KEITH +++$+++ Clips.
L550757 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
L550756 +++$+++ u3056 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ KEITH +++$+++ Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
L550755 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
L550754 +++$+++ u3056 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ KEITH +++$+++ No.
L550750 +++$+++ u3056 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ KEITH +++$+++ That's right.
L550749 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
L550748 +++$+++ u3056 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ KEITH +++$+++ I understand.  No, I'm not.
L551421 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...
L551420 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ How did you hook up with Faith?
L551419 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this shit caused by a random traffic stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that.  Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos.  You gotta take what you can, while you can.  Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.
L551418 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
L551417 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Naawww.
L551416 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ So there never was a death squad.
L551414 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You got froggy on me a couple times.
L551413 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
L551412 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
L551411 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
L551410 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
L551409 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I know.  So, I'm working for this puke, right?  And he says he'll pay me quite large to do the hooker. But also I gotta do his bitch girlfriend cause she knows the whole score and she's totally out of control.
L551408 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I won't say anything.
L551407 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect.
L551405 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You bet.  Did you like it?
L551404 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
L551403 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
L551402 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?
L551401 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ That's pretty much the way it happened.
L551400 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.
L551399 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You know, statistically that's the second most common word people say right before they die.  Shit being number one.
L551398 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Jesus!
L551397 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You just did.
L551396 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
L551395 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
L551394 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Where's Faith?
L551393 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
L551392 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Only way I could stand your ties.
L551391 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
L551321 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I intend to.
L551320 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ 2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.
L551319 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Come on!  If he gives us any shit, we kill 'em all.  Whattya say?  Just get your butt down here.  If I'm not at the shindig downstairs go to the room.  It's 2203.  You writin'?
L551318 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
L551317 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
L551316 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ What do you mean?
L551315 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ He's got her up in the room, under guard.  And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work a trade.
L551269 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ No.  Bad idea.
L551268 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Okay... what about Strickland?
L551267 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
L551264 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Thanks, buddy.  See... things weren't bad enough.  They weren't fucking bad enough!
L551263 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
L551262 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Jesus.
L551261 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.
L551260 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ What stuff?
L551259 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  I've heard stuff.
L551258 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Whattya mean?
L551252 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ No.  But his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs.  They put an amplifier in-line to boost the signal till it french-fried his brain.
L551251 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Is he dead?
L551250 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ He's been cooked-off
L551248 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!
L551247 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
L551119 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
L551118 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
L551117 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
L551116 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Looks like she was holding out.
L551115 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
L551114 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Faith OK?
L551112 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ W'sup, Max?
L551111 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
L551029 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Why me?
L551028 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.
L551025 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.
L551024 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Top ten.
L551023 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ But this is a bad one.
L551022 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ So've I.  Too much.
L551021 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
L551020 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
L551019 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ He records himself raping and killing her--
L551018 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
L551017 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
L551016 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
L551015 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Not now... I don't want to think about it--
L551014 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Let's work it.
L551013 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Yeah.  No, not really.
L551012 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You alright?  Y'okay?
L550976 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm on her.
L550975 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
L550974 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
L550973 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ You should feel like shit.
L550972 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
L550971 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
L550826 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Shutup a second!
L550825 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--
L550818 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ An ex-cop that doesn't carry.  It's embarrassing.  I oughta not be seen with you.  Hey, Mace.  What's goin' on?
L550817 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
L550816 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
L550798 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Hey, Iris, you okay?
L550797 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly.  Broken hearts are for assholes.
L550796 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Thanks, Max.  I'm touched by your concern.
L550795 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
L550794 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Naw.  She won't call me.
L550792 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can't live off of.  Good thing I wasn't any luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter right here!
L550791 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ You were lucky, Max.
L550789 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
L550788 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ That's not sayin' much.
L550787 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
L550786 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
L550785 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Thanks, Max.
L550784 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.
L550781 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Least you can do.
L550780 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
L550779 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
L550778 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
L551155 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ She never gave me a tape.
L551154 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
L551153 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ What clip?  What was it?
L551152 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
L551151 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
L551150 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Iris, man.  Pay attention.
L551149 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Who was just here?
L551148 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
L551147 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ What?
L551146 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...
L551143 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Well... the guy's fucked up.
