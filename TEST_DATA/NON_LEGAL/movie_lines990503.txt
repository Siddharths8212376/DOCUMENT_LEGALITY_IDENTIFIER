L646258 +++$+++ u8850 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ They seemed, closing by much 
L646257 +++$+++ u8850 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
L646256 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
L646255 +++$+++ u8850 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ I hope you enjoyed your visit.
L646193 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Uh, wrong picture Tony.
L646192 +++$+++ u8850 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ Velcome to ve Vaxverk.
L646401 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Go away.
L646400 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Sarah listen to me.
L646365 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ China
L646364 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Well, it all started when a friend and I
L646343 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Well.   .this, is Mr. Lincoln.  And that's the man I saw at the waxwork.
L646342 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Well?
L646340 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Who's is all this?
L646339 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
L646334 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Big deal!
L646333 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
L646332 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Oh that explains everything.
L646331 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.
L646330 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ You aren't sick! We've got to get back.  What are you doing!
L646300 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ A little?
L646299 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
L646298 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ That's not what you said last night.
L646297 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends.
L646286 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ No I'm serious.  It's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for something else.
L646285 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Come on.
L646284 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
L646283 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ No Mark. MARK Why not?
L646263 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I know what you mean.
L646262 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.
L646261 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Then why do you still like her?
L646254 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I'm not kidding.  I want to get out of here - now, ok.
L646253 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
L646252 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ What?  Tony and China, together?
L646251 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
L646247 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.
L646246 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Haven't we been doing our homework.
L646204 +++$+++ u8857 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ This. is killer.
L646203 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
L646202 +++$+++ u8857 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ This time I really don't see anyone man.
L646190 +++$+++ u8857 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Right behind you.
L646189 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Anyone else not coming?
L646183 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Right.
L646182 +++$+++ u8857 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Safety in numbers man.
L646181 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.
L646138 +++$+++ u8857 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
L646137 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
L646376 +++$+++ u8856 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SIR WILFRED +++$+++ Maybe before the event, never after.
L646375 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Can this be stopped?
L646374 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Doing what? SIR WILFRED Tipping the scales.  Ruining that delicate balance between good and evil.  I think  that our Mr. Lincoln has found a very effective way of doing it.  There's a  voodoo belief that by making a wax effigy of an evil being, containing a  belonging of his he possessed in earthly form, and feeding him the soul of a  believing victim, you can bring him back to life!
L646373 +++$+++ u8856 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SIR WILFRED +++$+++ You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
L646372 +++$+++ u8856 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SIR WILFRED +++$+++ Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
L646371 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Sell my soul?
L646370 +++$+++ u8856 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SIR WILFRED +++$+++ If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
L646368 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Six six and six
L646367 +++$+++ u8856 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SIR WILFRED +++$+++ Well divide 18 into three
L646366 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Well?
L646362 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Well, it's a long story.SIR WILFRED Oh good share.  I love them
L646361 +++$+++ u8856 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SIR WILFRED +++$+++ So Mark, what's so urgent?
L646360 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ No thank you sir we're fine.
L646358 +++$+++ u8856 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SIR WILFRED +++$+++ Hi there Sarah
L646357 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.  This is Sir Wilfred.
L646089 +++$+++ u8852 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARKS MOTHER +++$+++ I'll think about it.  Now run along darling.
L646088 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
L646087 +++$+++ u8852 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARKS MOTHER +++$+++ When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
L646086 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
L646085 +++$+++ u8852 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARKS MOTHER +++$+++ Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
L646084 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
L646083 +++$+++ u8852 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARKS MOTHER +++$+++ Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
L646082 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ They're all human beings
L646081 +++$+++ u8852 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARKS MOTHER +++$+++ One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
L646080 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Mom.
L646079 +++$+++ u8852 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARKS MOTHER +++$+++ Darling?  I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night.  Now  you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy.
L646177 +++$+++ u8857 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Never fear, Tony is here.  Ladies first.
L646176 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Looks a little spooky boys, you think we should do this?
L646160 +++$+++ u8857 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ YES!
L646159 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays
L646158 +++$+++ u8857 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ You bet.  We all can't be such modern people 
L646146 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ You guys are being real assholes
L646145 +++$+++ u8857 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain
L646142 +++$+++ u8857 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Oh! The virgin has spoken! SARAH Stop it!
L646141 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Stop saying things so loud!
L648533 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Then we both are.
L648532 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
L648531 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What?
L648530 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ No.  But once I heard...
L648529 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Did you?
L648528 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ A ghost?
L648527 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I started seeing things.
L648526 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ What do you mean?
L648525 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
L648524 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ So much.
L648523 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I miss you.
L648522 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Listen to me.  The one thing in life that I definitely don't regret...is the choice. I made to be your mother.
L648521 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Are you mad at me?
L648520 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ I know he does.
L648519 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ He loves you very much.  He just--
L648518 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Yes it is.  Can we please not do that? Please?  Cause it is.
L648517 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ That's not true.
L648516 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
L648515 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No, he wouldn't.
L648514 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Besides, Dad would have freaked.
L648512 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Why?
L648511 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
L648510 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ That was very good.
L647966 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
L647965 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Of course you will.
L647964 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ I'll come back all the time.
L647963 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I know that.
L647962 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ It's only two hours away.
L647961 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Yes?
L647960 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Hey.
L647959 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Do you have a scarf?
L648459 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it.  My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of "empty-nest" episode where I saw some things that weren't there.  Let's deal with that.  I'm willing to deal with that.  I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist.
L648458 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ That can't feel good.
L648457 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
L648456 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ What?
L648452 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Last year.  I drove my car up a tree. Nothing serious, this...  ...a minor concussion.  But the car looked bad.  It could have been bad.  I think it scared the hell out of Norman.
L648451 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ You were in an accident?
L648450 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
L648449 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Have you been hurt?
L648448 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
L648447 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ What do you think?  Guess.
L648446 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No.
L648445 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Do you?
L648444 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She said, "You know."  That I know.
L648442 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
L648441 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ You're saying you willed these events to happen?
L648440 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
L648439 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ You think you influenced her?
L648438 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Isn't there something called group hysteria?
L648437 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Your friend saw them.
L648436 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Yes, but...
L648435 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
L648434 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Well, that's what we're here for.
L648433 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What's happening to me?
L648361 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ I don't know.  My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle.
L648360 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ How?
L648359 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Nope.
L648358 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Are you humoring me?
L648357 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Can't hurt.  And I think it's important you find out what she wants.
L648356 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You think that'll help?
L648355 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Try to communicate with her somehow.
L648354 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What?
L648352 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What do you think I should do?
L648351 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Fine.
L648350 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
L648349 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Do you have any idea who she is?
L648348 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Pretty.  She's a blond.
L648347 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ What does she look like?
L648346 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
L648345 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ How do you know it's a she?
L648344 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
L648342 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Mm-hmm.
L648341 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ These are good.
L648336 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You're joking.
L648335 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Fireball?
L648334 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard?
L648333 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Why is he worried?
L648332 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No.
L648331 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Do you really think so?
L648330 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
L648329 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Your husband?
L648328 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Because he was worried about me.
L648327 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Then why did you?
L648326 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I didn't want to come.
L648325 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Mine.  His.  We both...thought...
L648324 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Who's idea was it?
L648582 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ The wives.
L648581 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Who's that?
L648580 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
L648579 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
L648578 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ Toward the end.  You remember?
L648577 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ At the party.
L648576 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
L648575 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
L648574 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.
L648573 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year.
