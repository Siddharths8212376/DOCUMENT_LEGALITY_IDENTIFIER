L642764 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Only because I got pulled out early.
L642763 +++$+++ u8800 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ DEANE +++$+++ I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive.
L642982 +++$+++ u8800 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ DEANE +++$+++ Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.
L642981 +++$+++ u8806 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.
L642623 +++$+++ u8806 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ I was assured the problem was corrected.
L642622 +++$+++ u8800 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ DEANE +++$+++ Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
L642621 +++$+++ u8806 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.
L642620 +++$+++ u8800 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ DEANE +++$+++ What the hell happened?
L642618 +++$+++ u8800 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ DEANE +++$+++ Don't remind me.
L642617 +++$+++ u8806 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
L642616 +++$+++ u8800 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ DEANE +++$+++ What did Cox pull him out early for?
L642668 +++$+++ u8806 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ As a matter of fact, I do.
L642667 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ He hears...everything.
L642666 +++$+++ u8806 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ How does he know who I am?
L642664 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ I understand... I understand perfectly.
L642663 +++$+++ u8806 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
L642662 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ I'M WHAT?!
L642661 +++$+++ u8806 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ You've had a year—and—a—half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
L642660 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ I'm still making adjustments...
L642659 +++$+++ u8806 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ Of the six prison inmates you've tested —— all of whom have had at least some military or survival training -— only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
L642658 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
L642657 +++$+++ u8806 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ You embarrassed me in front of the highest—ranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
L642747 +++$+++ u8804 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ What I need is a nymphomaniac.
L642746 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ You need a maid.
L642743 +++$+++ u8804 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ I know.  I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. If you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. And bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you...
L642742 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
L642741 +++$+++ u8804 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ ... and you get nano—death.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
L642740 +++$+++ u8804 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ Separate the character module from the neural net...
L642739 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ How do you kill it?
L642738 +++$+++ u8804 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
L642737 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ This is supposed to be years away.
L642736 +++$+++ u8804 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
L642735 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ It feels so.. .real.
L642734 +++$+++ u8804 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ Coordinated by polymer neural net.
L642733 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ It's nano—technology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
L642732 +++$+++ u8804 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
L642731 +++$+++ u8804 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ You're...such a wimp.
L642730 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ Get that fucking thing away from me!
L642727 +++$+++ u8804 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ Bastard...  Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.
L642726 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ Do I get to see it or not?
L642725 +++$+++ u8804 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ I haven't been working on anything.
L642724 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
L642723 +++$+++ u8804 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ HEY!!!
L643184 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ Then fix it.
L643183 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.
L643182 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ Talk so I can understand.
L643181 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.
L643176 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ Turn it down!
L643175 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ I wonder how that...
L643174 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ Show me his physical sensory level.
L643173 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ How should I know?
L643172 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ What's wrong with Parker?
L643171 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.
L643215 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ Don't worry. Through me, you will live forever...
L643214 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
L643213 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  What do you think I'm doing?
L643211 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ Glad to...
L643210 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ Help me get out of here.
L643209 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ How can I ever thank—you for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
L643208 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ Of course you are.
L643207 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ I am beautiful, aren't I?
L642754 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ What do you expect me to do, thank him?
L642753 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ SID —— NO!!!
L642745 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ I think I understand what you have in mind...
L642744 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ You catching my drift?
L642729 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ All my work is my finest.
L642728 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
L642698 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ I had something a little different in mind.  Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?
L642697 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
L642696 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
L642695 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ My God...
L642694 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
L642693 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
L642692 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ It was me, what?
L642691 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ It was you, wasn't it?
L642690 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
L642689 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
L642656 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ Think hard -- it'll come to you...
L642655 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ Should I have?
L642654 +++$+++ u8801 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ LINDENMEYER +++$+++ Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
L642653 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
L643284 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ You won't want to watch. Turn around.
L643283 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ What do we do now?
L643281 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ Duck!
L643280 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Then shoot him already.
L643279 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ I couldn't tell you.
L643278 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ How's your pulse?
L643260 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...
L643259 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Where the hell are you going?
L643227 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ I don't know.
L643226 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Sid?
L643225 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ My guess is dead.
L643224 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Lindenmeyer?
L643223 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ More or less.
L643222 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ ...I think so...You?
L643221 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ You okay?
L643163 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Because this pain—in—the—ass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.
L643162 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ That's why I'm asking.
L643161 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ You don't know?
L643160 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go —— right now.  Why are you going to do this?
L643159 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
L643158 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ Can I ask you something?
L643156 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
L643155 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ Find out anything?
L643136 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ Thanks.
L643135 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Nice work.
L643134 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...
L643133 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ See something?
L643132 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ That, or living through him...
L643131 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Think he's keeping track of his creation?
L643130 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.
L643129 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Part of him is.
L643128 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
L643127 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
L643126 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
L643117 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ I was wrong.  And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again.
L643116 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
L643115 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ You're not capable of it.
L643114 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
L643113 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ How did you find out about the toxin?
L643110 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?
L643109 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ He didn't know about the neural toxin.  I did.
L643105 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
L643104 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ We know you didn't kill those guards.
L643055 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!
L643054 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!
L643043 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
L643042 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ Parker -— stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you——
L643031 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Both.
L643030 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ Which way?
L643029 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Authority still makes me nervous.
L643028 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
L643027 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Real effective security...
L643012 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ You like baseball?
L643011 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
L643005 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ I don't know, yet. What we do know is his performances are increasing in scale, not decreasing.  Whatever it is, he isn't finished...
L643004 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Start of what?
L643003 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
L642975 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ I'm doing the best I can!
L642974 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ What's the problem?
L642955 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Tell him.
L642954 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ This isn't a game, Parker!
L642953 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ You know I am.
L642952 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ Enjoying yourself?
L642951 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?
L642950 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Nothing.
L642949 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ What did you do to those people?
L642948 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ This is my area of expertise.
L642947 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ What the hell's going on?!
L642939 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Stop me.
L642938 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ Don't get out of the car.
L642934 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while?
L642933 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
L642932 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Relax. I know what you meant.
L642931 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
L642930 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Don't worry about it, all right?
L642929 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're re—adapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
L642928 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
L642924 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does.  Welcome to police work. You better like coffee.
L642923 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
L642922 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Sounds to me like a well—educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
L642921 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
L642920 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ What does that mean?
L642919 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
L642918 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
L642917 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
L642916 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
L642915 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
L642914 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ She's beautiful, you know?
L642913 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
L642912 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
L642910 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ How did you get your hand out?
L642909 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
L642906 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ And I'm going to make sure of it.  Give me your wrist.
L642905 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
