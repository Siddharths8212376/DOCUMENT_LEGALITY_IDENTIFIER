L595489 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl.
L595472 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ You left that guy alone in the room?
L595471 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Taking a shower.
L595470 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
L595469 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
L595468 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.
L595467 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
L595466 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.
L595464 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ I don't think I wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.
L595463 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
L595462 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
L595461 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
L595460 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ What's wrong with you?
L595459 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Nothing.  It got messed up.
L595458 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ What happened to your hair?
L595353 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Have another drink, Thelma.
L595352 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.
L595351 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ How do I look?
L595350 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ I won't wait up.
L595349 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
L595348 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
L595347 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ I didn't ask him to come!  It's like I said, Thelma, he just loves the chase.
L595346 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ You are so sweet to that guy, you really are.  Imagine not wanting to drag him into this.  He is a lucky man.
L595345 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
L595344 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ So what are you gonna tell him?
L595342 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ I heard that.
L595341 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.
L595340 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad.
L595332 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Thelma kinda took to him.
L595331 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Yup.  That's him goin'.  I love to watch him go.
L595299 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ He's a real piece o' work.  I wish you could meet him.
L595298 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ She thinks he's a pig.
L595297 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ That's puttin' it mildly.
L595296 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Louise and Darryl don't get along.
L595295 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ He's got a lot to be proud of.
L595282 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ No, Louise.  How come you never said what happened?
L595281 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about this!  Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will!  You understand?
L595280 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ I know, Louise, but we're running for our lives!  Don't you think you could make an exception just this once?!  I mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!
L595279 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
L595278 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
L595277 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
L595276 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
L595275 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.
L595274 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ I just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride.  Did you see his butt?  Darryl doesn't have a cute butt.  You could park a car in the shadow of his ass.
L595272 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ He said "Okay, Thelma.  I just wanted to know you were alright.  I hope you're havin' a good time.  You sure deserve one after puttin' up with me all the time.  I love you, honey."
L595271 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ What did Darryl say?
L595270 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ I wish we could've brought him with us.
L595266 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Louise.
L595265 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ It's probably not a good idea.
L595264 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and I thought since...
L595239 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ I don't know.  I won't be.
L595238 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Will I be?
L595237 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
L595236 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Call him?
L595215 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Don't you fall apart on me. Goddamnit, Thelma.  Every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time... Not this time. Everything's changed now... Now you can do whatever you want, but I'm going to Mexico.  I'm going.  Are you coming with me?
L595214 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
L595213 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
L595212 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ But you think he fools around.
L595211 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
L595210 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
L595209 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
L595208 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
L595207 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
L595206 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
L595205 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
L595204 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
L595195 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ I think better when I drive.
L595194 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Did you finish thinking?
L595156 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Most people just cause me trouble, but that car always gets me out of it.
L595155 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people.
L595154 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ You're not touchin' that car.
L595153 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Give me the keys.
L595152 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
L595151 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ I suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, I'm all out of ideas.
L595150 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ You could help me try and figure it out!  I gotta figure out what to do, and you could try and help me.
L595149 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Actin' like what?!  How am I supposed to act?  'Scuse me for not knowing what to do after you blow somebody's head off!
L595148 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Why are you actin' like this?
L595147 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ What do you mean?
L595146 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Just what the hell is wrong with you?
L595145 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
L595144 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
L595142 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Hmmm.  We gotta get some money.
L595141 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ I'm cash poor.
L595138 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.
L595137 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?
L595119 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ So this is all my fault, is it.
L595118 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ It means shut up, Thelma.
L595117 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Just what is that supposed to mean?
L595116 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
L595115 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun.
L595114 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ We have to think this through.  We have to be smart.  Now is not the time to panic.  If we panic now, we're done for.  Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us.  We're still okay.  Now all we have to do is just figure out our next move.
L595112 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ It means you don't talk to anybody. You don't draw attention to yourself in any way.  Do you understand that?
L595111 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Yes.
L595110 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ We gotta be inconspicuous.  Do you know what that means?
L595104 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe that?!  We just don't live in that kind of world.  Pull over!
L595103 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
L595102 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Which part?
L595101 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
L595100 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
L595099 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.
L595098 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ I don't know, Thelma!  I don't know! Just shut up a minute so I can think.
L595097 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Louise.  Where are we going?
L595095 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ West.  Left.
L595094 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Shit!  I... I, which way?
L595091 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Get the car!
L595090 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
L595089 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Get the car.
L595088 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Oh my God.
L595057 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Ready when you are.
L595056 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road.
L595055 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ In the meantime, you said we were gonna have some fun.  So let's have some!
L595054 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Exactly.
L595051 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?
L595050 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
L595049 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
L595048 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
L595047 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
L595046 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
L595045 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Well, just relax, will ya.  You're makin' me nervous.
L595044 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Maybe.
L595043 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ So what if he was?  It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.
L595042 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
L595041 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
L595028 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Yeah!
L595027 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Alright...  I changed my mind.  I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.
L595026 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Well, I've had it up to my ass with sedate!  You said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. Well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!
L595025 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
L595024 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
L595023 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Thelma!
L595019 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Isn't this fun?
L595018 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
L595016 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Then what difference does it make if we stop?  Come on.  I never get to do stuff like this.
L595015 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
L595014 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
L595013 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
L595012 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm hungry.
L595007 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Well, he has never let me go.  He never lets me do one goddamn thing that's any fun.  All he wants me to do is hang around the house the whole time while he's out doing God only knows what.
L595006 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
L595005 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ 'Cause I didn't ask him.
L595004 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ How come he let you go?
L595003 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
L595002 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
L595001 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Whose place is this again?
L594997 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway.
L594996 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
L594995 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
L594994 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ In case of what?
L594993 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
L594992 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.
L594989 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Neither do I, Thelma, but Darryl does it, how hard can it be?  I'll see you later.  Be ready.
L594988 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ I don't know how to fish, Louise.
L594987 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
L594986 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Okay.  I will, too.
L594985 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
L594984 +++$+++ u3266 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ What kind of stuff do I bring?
L594983 +++$+++ u3261 +++$+++ m216 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
