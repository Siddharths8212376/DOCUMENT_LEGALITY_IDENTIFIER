L244090 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ You haven't talked to him.
L244089 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Graff?  Because I worked for him.
L244088 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ How do you know he'd buy them?
L244087 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Yes.

L244083 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ What could we get for them?  I don't know.  Buck a throw...buck-a- half a throw...I don't know...Hey, who knows what they're worth, what do they pay for them?  All told...must be, I'd... three bucks a throw...I don't know.
L244082 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ What could somebody get for them?
L244081 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ That's what I'm saying.  We were, if we were that kind of guys, to knock it off, and trash the joint, it looks like robbery, and take the fuckin' leads out of the files...go to Jerry Graff.
L244080 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ Huh.
L244079 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Someone should rob the office.

L244068 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ What do you mean?
L244067 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Someone should stand up and strike back.
L244066 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ What?
L244065 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ I want to tell you what somebody should do.
L244064 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ What?

No.  You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.
L244062 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ When they...
L244061 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ They have...

L244049 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ That's the God's truth.  And it gets me depressed.  I swear that it does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn: "Somebody wins the Cadillac this month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked."
L244048 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ That's the truth...
L244047 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ He made up those rules, and we're working for him.
L244046 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ That's right...
L244045 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ To say "I'm going on my own." 'Cause what you do, George, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. And we enslave ourselves.  To please.  To win some fucking toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those...
L244044 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ What act?
L244043 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Just the act.
L244042 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ What?
L244041 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?

L244039 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Starting up.
L244038 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ What?
L244037 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
L244036 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ No, it's not that simple, Dave...
L244035 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
L244034 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
L244033 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ That's what I'm saying.  Why?  The leads.  He's got the good leads... what are we, we're sitting in the shit here.  Why?  We have to go to them to get them.  Huh.  Ninety percent our sale, we're paying to the office for the leads.
L244032 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ Himself?
L244031 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
L244030 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ With River Oaks?
L244029 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.
L244028 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ Yes.
L244027 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ The nurses?
L244026 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ I heard that they were running cold.
L244025 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ He's doing very well.
L244024 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ He is?
L244023 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...
L244022 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ Nurses.
L244021 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ That's thinking.  Now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself.  He's...that's what I... that's thinking! "Who?  Who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who?"
L244020 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ Yes.
L244019 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Look at Jerry Graff.  He's clean, he's doing business for himself, he's got his, that list of his with the nurses...see?  You see?  That's thinking.  Why take ten percent?  A ten percent comm...why are we giving the rest away?  What are we giving ninety per...for nothing. For some jerk sit in the office tell you "Get out there and close." "Go win the Cadillac." Graff.  He goes out and buys.  He pays top dollar for the... you see?
L244018 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ No.
L244017 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
L244016 +++$+++ u5522 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ AARONOW +++$+++ Who?

They got a grapevine.  Fuckin' Indians, George. Not my cup of tea.  Speaking of which I want to tell you something:  I never got a cup of tea with them. You see them in the restaurants.  A supercilious race.  What is this look on their face all the time?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Their broads all look like they just got fucked with a dead cat, I don't know.  I don't know.
