L446403 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I told you she's just..
L446402 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ How about your new friend?
L446401 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Of course.
L446400 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
L446399 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
L446398 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You already have the checks, darling.
L446397 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
L446396 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Years, why?
L446395 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ How long have you had it?
L446394 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ What does it look like?
L446393 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ What's this?
L446392 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Kind or not kind. What's the difference? It always ends up the same way.
L446391 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ That's not very kind.
L446390 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.
L446388 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I seem to recognize this routine. First the kiss then the touch.  Oh, what's the use. You're you.
L446387 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
L446386 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You don't have to make a pose of it.
L446385 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
L446383 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ She is much younger than I am. That's something I'm going to have to get used to. Isn't it, Larry? They'll all be much younger than I am. Here.  Tear them up.
L446382 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ What'll we do about it, Margo?
L446381 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Correct. I couldn't even afford to pay a lawyer to defend me.
L446380 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You'd go to jail. For a long term.
L446379 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I have a rough idea.
L446378 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
L446377 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky.
L446375 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
L446374 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
L446373 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You ought to know why.
L446372 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
L446371 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
L446370 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
L446369 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
L446368 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
L446367 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Why should I mind?
L446366 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
L446365 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Nice.
L446364 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
L446363 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Who's the girl?
L446362 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ So-so.
L446361 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
L446360 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I'm afraid you're not very glad to see me, Margo.
L449019 +++$+++ u7106 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh, many things.  Inertia ... Stalin and the Cold War... a failure of nerve.  We took the seediest, most inefficient fifth of the economy into State care, paid out millions for it, put the same old duffers in charge.  A new broom with very old bristles.  When the Tories were returned, I went and sat in the BM and wrote my little book on Chartism.
L449018 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ What went wrong?
L449017 +++$+++ u7106 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong.
L449016 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
L449015 +++$+++ u7106 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now — the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act.  A small minority thought that England was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it.  The rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking it all.
L449014 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Yes.
L449013 +++$+++ u7106 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Shall we go?
L449005 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Well, we were just...
L449004 +++$+++ u7106 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Hello.  Anyone for a walk?  Tom isn't, I can tell you.
L448994 +++$+++ u7106 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ These are transcripts of various radio broadcasts, including Gaitskill's, the one they tried to stop.  You ought to have that ...
L448993 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ I will, thanks.
L448992 +++$+++ u7106 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ The references are to Hansard or to newspapers.  I haven't got the actual speeches now.  You'll have to chase them up.
L448865 +++$+++ u7106 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ We'll see you next week, and if--
L448864 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Thank you.
L448863 +++$+++ u7106 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Don't be silly.  I'll look out some more Suez material for you. You'll be very welcome.
L448862 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
L448861 +++$+++ u7106 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
L448860 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Yes.
L448859 +++$+++ u7106 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
L448858 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
L448857 +++$+++ u7106 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I do worry about Susan.  Have you known her long?  She hasn't mentioned you.
L448855 +++$+++ u7106 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I think you'll do very well.
L448854 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ You're kind to be so encouraging.
L448853 +++$+++ u7106 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ If you like.  But don't be too modest, James.  The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books.  You are highly qualified.  You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job.  Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history.  A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.
L448852 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ So I can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.I shall be fulfilling a citizen's duty.
L448851 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Thanks.
L448850 +++$+++ u7106 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Here I am lecturing you.  Have some pâté.
L448849 +++$+++ u7106 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ If we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost.  Everyone must have a memory, everyone needs to be a historian.  In this country, for example, we're in danger of losing hard-won freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present.
L448848 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ History books are first onto the bonfires.
L448847 +++$+++ u7106 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
L448846 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ To Ann.
L448845 +++$+++ u7106 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ And I'd like you to call me Ann.
L448844 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
L448843 +++$+++ u7106 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
L448842 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ It's fine, thank you.
L448841 +++$+++ u7106 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ My husband apologises for not joining us.  It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield?
L448840 +++$+++ u7106 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Good.  Suez was a minefield for both parties.
L448839 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Yes.
L448838 +++$+++ u7106 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?
L448837 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
L448836 +++$+++ u7106 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.
L448835 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ What a shame.
L448834 +++$+++ u7106 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ My first husband worked for the BBC.  I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  I became involved too.  I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it.  By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.
L448833 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ He was delightful.
L448832 +++$+++ u7106 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ He's a little unhappy.  I hope he wasn't a nuisance?
L448831 +++$+++ u7106 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Tom, Daddy would like to see you in the garden.  And will you ask Betty to bring us some coffee. And remember to say 'please'.
L448830 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ It's kind of you to see me.
L448829 +++$+++ u7106 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.
L448910 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ I'll suggest it.  Remember though, we're news, not features.  It might help if you could get yourselves attacked by the police.  Anyway, I'll be back with this soon. Thanks.
L448909 +++$+++ u7107 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ CARMEN +++$+++ But what we need is national coverage.  It's difficult with this Falklands madness going on. Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back?
L448908 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Terrific.
L448903 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Very good.
L448902 +++$+++ u7107 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ CARMEN +++$+++ Give them here.  This tells you how the Women's Peace Camp came to be set up.  All local women at first, then we had support from women and men all over the country.
L448899 +++$+++ u7107 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ CARMEN +++$+++ That doesn't matter.  As long as we can get our message through to someone there.  Jill, where are those handouts?
L448898 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ But I'm not an interviewer or a correspondent.
L448891 +++$+++ u7107 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ CARMEN +++$+++ This is Jill, Carol, Betty, Mandy, Louise, Pete over there, and I'm Carmen.
L448890 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Penfield.  James Penfield.
L448889 +++$+++ u7107 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ CARMEN +++$+++ Now first of all, tell us your name.
L448880 +++$+++ u7107 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ CARMEN +++$+++ Sit on that log, dear.
L448879 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Thank you.
L449035 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Exactly that.
L449034 +++$+++ u7108 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Aha.  James giving some woman the old heave-ho.
L448941 +++$+++ u7108 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Look, I'd rather you didn't ask me questions.  I can't talk about it.
L448940 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
L448939 +++$+++ u7108 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
L448938 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ How's Mary?
L448937 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Keep me company.
L448936 +++$+++ u7108 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ I'm not sure I can face it.
L448935 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Working hard on that book I was telling you about.  Coming to the meeting?
L448934 +++$+++ u7108 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
L448933 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Charles!  I didn't know you were back.  Have a good holiday?
L448711 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ A glamorous young lady way above his station...
L448710 +++$+++ u7109 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Congratulations.  Who with?
L448707 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ It needn't concern you, Edward. James has got some news.  He needs a poet's advice.
L448706 +++$+++ u7109 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway?
L448705 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Of course.
L448704 +++$+++ u7109 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Attributed?
L448701 +++$+++ u7109 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I see.
L448700 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Committed to memory.  Forever.
L448699 +++$+++ u7109 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Don't tell me you've actually read it, Jeremy.
L448698 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ It's terribly good.
L449119 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ And to history.
L449118 +++$+++ u7110 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ GOLD +++$+++ It's everything we wanted.  A very good read.  A terrific piece of work.  So, here's to you and Suez.
L449117 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Thank you.
L449116 +++$+++ u7110 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ GOLD +++$+++ James... I can't begin to tell you how pleased we all are.  Congratulations, and I really mean it.
L448650 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Like I was saying, the American angle in Suez is very important. I wouldn't want to say they let us down.  I think that's wrong.  A good ally is one who doesn't back you up in your mistakes, who tells you when to pull back.  And the Americans were good allies.  Simple as that.
L448649 +++$+++ u7110 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ GOLD +++$+++ You know the lingo.  Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.
L448648 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Freshman and sophomores...
L448647 +++$+++ u7110 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ GOLD +++$+++ Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages.  Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why.  Your readership will be first and second year American collage students...
L448643 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Thank you.
L448642 +++$+++ u7110 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ GOLD +++$+++ And you'll join me in a sambucca?
L448641 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Yes, please.
L448640 +++$+++ u7110 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ GOLD +++$+++ Are you going to have coffee?
L448639 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ I'd want to set out events as they happened.  The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal.  It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do.  Then there's the essential--
L448638 +++$+++ u7110 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ GOLD +++$+++ Good.
L448637 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ No.  I'd want to--
L448636 +++$+++ u7110 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ GOLD +++$+++ Yes...You're not a socialist then?
L448635 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ ...from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on Suez...
L448634 +++$+++ u7110 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ GOLD +++$+++ And some of that.  Sorry.
L448633 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ ...break away completely from--
L448632 +++$+++ u7110 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ GOLD +++$+++ I'll have some of that.
L448631 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
L448630 +++$+++ u7110 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ GOLD +++$+++ Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.
L448589 +++$+++ u7110 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ GOLD +++$+++ I won't introduce you all by name. Basically James, this is our UK sales team.  What was I saying? Yes, these graduate trainees...
L448588 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Hello.
L448587 +++$+++ u7110 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ GOLD +++$+++ I know, I know!  Gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to The Cold War.  James Penfield.  He wrote the opening chapter, on 'The Berlin Airlift'.  One of the best chapters in the book.
L449084 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I know.  I'm sorry.
L449083 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ We don't seem to get much time to talk.
L449079 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Oh ... excuse me.  There's Nicholas.
L449078 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Shall we have a drink or something?
L449003 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Why not.
L449002 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ In your car
L449001 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ That'll be fun
L449000 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.
L448999 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ What did he want?
L448998 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Jeremy phoned this morning
L448978 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Yes.  Might.  Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.
L448977 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Might?
L448971 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Might?
L448970 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I might.
L448969 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?
L448966 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ He's all right, the professor.
L448965 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
L448964 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ I haven't seen much of you.
L448931 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Well, you should.
L448930 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ I haven't really thought about it.
L448929 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?
L448927 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.
L448926 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Did she talk about me?
L448925 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ I think she liked me.
L448924 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I think we're ready now, thank you.  And how was Norfolk?  Did you get on with my mother?
L448790 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You just might.
L448789 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ I might see you in Norfolk over the weekend.
L448788 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I bet.  Thanks for the drink.
L448787 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ In radio we're different.
L448786 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
L448785 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ You don't trust me.
L448783 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Too late.  Just my luck.
L448782 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you.
L448781 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Me too.
L448780 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I have to be up early. 
L448779 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Why not stay?
L448725 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Yes, if you like.  Call me at work.
L448724 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Again?
L448723 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Well, you know...
L448722 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Very thoughtful.
L448721 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I called you a taxi.
L448720 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Who?
L448719 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Damn.  They're early.
L448718 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ That must be rather nice, in a way.  I mean, you don't have any--
L448717 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Both dead.
L448716 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours.
L448715 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ How nice.
L448714 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious.  I really was upset. I stopped going home.  I never phoned.  I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand.  So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart.  And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
L448692 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Yes.  You're much too old to making a drama out of alienation, or whatever you call it.  You've got to take responsibility for your own happiness.  That's what I think anyway.
L448691 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Oh yes?
L448690 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.
L448689 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ No, there's a fourth.  Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way.
L448688 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ And you're at this third stage
