L260039 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I can't.
L260038 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
L260037 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
L260036 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Fancy.
L259970 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Annie!
L259969 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.
L259966 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You guys will make a fabulous couple.
L259965 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
L259964 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
L259963 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I'd say you must have the wrong number.
L259962 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
L259961 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ What's this big, big news?
L259960 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.
L259899 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ For that matter, I might as well be a girl scout tonight. I plan on making popcorn and watching Doctor Dementia. Six straight hours of horror movies. Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her.
L259898 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Thanks.
L259897 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
L259896 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
L259895 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What's the pumpkin for?
L259894 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That's probably all he can do.
L259893 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ He can still watch.
L259892 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
L259891 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ He was watching me.
L259890 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Probably Mister Riddle.
L259889 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
L259888 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Lies.
L259887 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I wasn't spooked.
L259886 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You still spooked?
L259872 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Bye.
L259871 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Sure, see you later.
L259870 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.
L259869 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I've already lost it.
L259868 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
L259867 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I thought it was an obscene phone call.
L259866 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
L259865 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
L259864 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Of course.
L259863 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Annie, was that you?
L259862 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Why did you hang up on me?
L259861 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Hello?
L259848 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Okay. Bye.
L259847 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later.
L259845 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ The guys think I'm too smart.
L259844 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.
L259843 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Cute.
L259842 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
L259841 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ He was standing right here.
L259838 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Subtle, isn't he? Hey creep!
L259837 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
L259836 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I don't see anything.
L259835 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Behind that bush there.
L259834 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Look where?
L259833 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Look.
L259828 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Terrific. I've got three choices. Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw, or talk to you.
L259827 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I'M baby sitting for the Doyles. It's only three houses away. We can keep each other company.
L259814 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I forgot my chemistry book.
L259813 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I have a place for that.
L259812 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Shit!
L259805 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Exploring uncharted territory?
L259804 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'm never smiling again. Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell me...
L259803 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling.
L260033 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Come with me.
L260032 +++$+++ u5727 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Yes.
L260030 +++$+++ u5727 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I want to stay here and watch this.
L260029 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
L260028 +++$+++ u5727 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I don't want to.
L260027 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, come on, get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul.
L260026 +++$+++ u5727 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I don't know.
L260025 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
L260024 +++$+++ u5727 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I'm scared.
L260019 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.
L260018 +++$+++ u5727 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ You locked yourself in.
L260017 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Lindsey, open the door! I'm locked in the laundry room!
L260016 +++$+++ u5727 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Annie, Paul's on the phone!
L259977 +++$+++ u5727 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ No, he's not.
L259976 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
L259959 +++$+++ u5727 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Here, Lester.
L259958 +++$+++ u5722 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Get him out of here!
L260125 +++$+++ u5729 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LYNDA +++$+++ YEAH?
L260124 +++$+++ u5723 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I thought you were gonna get one for me.
L260123 +++$+++ u5729 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LYNDA +++$+++ Go get me a beer.
L260122 +++$+++ u5723 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Yeah.
L260121 +++$+++ u5729 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LYNDA +++$+++ Is that all you say?
L260120 +++$+++ u5723 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Yeah.
L260119 +++$+++ u5729 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LYNDA +++$+++ Want a beer?
L260118 +++$+++ u5723 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Yeah.
L260117 +++$+++ u5729 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LYNDA +++$+++ Fantastic. Totally.
L260115 +++$+++ u5729 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LYNDA +++$+++ I can't. What if it's the Wallaces!? We'd get Annie in trouble.
L260114 +++$+++ u5723 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Just answer the damn phone.
L260113 +++$+++ u5729 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LYNDA +++$+++ That's great. Now you'll be too drunk to...
L260112 +++$+++ u5729 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LYNDA +++$+++ And I can't keep you interested?
L260111 +++$+++ u5723 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I can't help it. It just keeps ringing.
L260090 +++$+++ u5729 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LYNDA +++$+++ Annie probably took Lindsey out or something. Let's look for a note.
L260089 +++$+++ u5723 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I wonder where they went.
L260086 +++$+++ u5729 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LYNDA +++$+++ Totally...
L260085 +++$+++ u5723 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ ...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
L260084 +++$+++ u5729 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LYNDA +++$+++ You idiot!
L260083 +++$+++ u5723 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Okay. First I rip your clothes off...
L260082 +++$+++ u5729 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LYNDA +++$+++ Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?
L259705 +++$+++ u5724 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BOYFRIEND +++$+++ Yeah.
L259704 +++$+++ u5732 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ SISTER +++$+++ Promise?
L259703 +++$+++ u5724 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BOYFRIEND +++$+++ Yeah, sure.
L259702 +++$+++ u5732 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ SISTER +++$+++ Will you call me tomorrow?
L259701 +++$+++ u5724 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BOYFRIEND +++$+++ I gotta go.
L259699 +++$+++ u5732 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ SISTER +++$+++ Michael's around someplace...
L259698 +++$+++ u5724 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BOYFRIEND +++$+++ We're all alone, aren't we?
L259697 +++$+++ u5724 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BOYFRIEND +++$+++ Are you sure?
L259696 +++$+++ u5732 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ SISTER +++$+++ My parents won't be back till ten.
L260174 +++$+++ u5728 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ Three blocks down. Get in the car and go up that other street and then back down here. I'm going up the block.
L260173 +++$+++ u5725 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BRACKETT +++$+++ Where?
L260172 +++$+++ u5728 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ I found the car! He's here!
L260171 +++$+++ u5725 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BRACKETT +++$+++ Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...
L260081 +++$+++ u5725 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BRACKETT +++$+++ I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
L260080 +++$+++ u5728 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ They could be.
L260079 +++$+++ u5725 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BRACKETT +++$+++ More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.
L260078 +++$+++ u5728 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing THIS NIGHT. He's waited for it, inhumanly patient. Hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. Death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. You can ignore it, or you can help me stop it.
L260077 +++$+++ u5725 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BRACKETT +++$+++ Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
L260076 +++$+++ u5728 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ Exactly what do you need?
L260075 +++$+++ u5725 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BRACKETT +++$+++ You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
L260074 +++$+++ u5728 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ You have the wrong feeling.
L260073 +++$+++ u5725 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BRACKETT +++$+++ Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
L260072 +++$+++ u5728 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ Sure...
L260071 +++$+++ u5725 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BRACKETT +++$+++ You all right?
L260070 +++$+++ u5728 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ Jesus!
L259944 +++$+++ u5725 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BRACKETT +++$+++ I'll check back in an hour.
L259943 +++$+++ u5728 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
L259942 +++$+++ u5725 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BRACKETT +++$+++ I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
L259941 +++$+++ u5728 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
L259940 +++$+++ u5725 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BRACKETT +++$+++ What do we do?
L259939 +++$+++ u5728 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ I am.  I met him fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left, no conscience, no reason, no understanding, in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death or right or wrong. I met this six- year-old boy with a blank, cold emotionless face and the blackest of eyes, the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him and another seven trying to keep him locked away when I realized what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.
L259938 +++$+++ u5725 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BRACKETT +++$+++ Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
L259937 +++$+++ u5728 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ I suppose I do seem a bit sinister for a doctor.
L259932 +++$+++ u5728 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ He isn't a man.
L259931 +++$+++ u5725 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BRACKETT +++$+++ A man wouldn't do that...
L259930 +++$+++ u5728 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ Could have...
L259929 +++$+++ u5725 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BRACKETT +++$+++ Come on... A skunk could have killed it...
L259924 +++$+++ u5728 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ They may be right.
L259923 +++$+++ u5725 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BRACKETT +++$+++ Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
L259922 +++$+++ u5728 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ Anybody live here?
L259921 +++$+++ u5728 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ I'll be here.
L259920 +++$+++ u5725 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BRACKETT +++$+++ Ten minutes.
L259919 +++$+++ u5728 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ It's important.
L259918 +++$+++ u5725 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BRACKETT +++$+++ May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
L259917 +++$+++ u5728 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
L259916 +++$+++ u5725 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ BRACKETT +++$+++ Lee Brackett.
L259915 +++$+++ u5728 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
L260106 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Have a good time.
L260105 +++$+++ u5729 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LYNDA +++$+++ Okay. Later.
L260104 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
L260103 +++$+++ u5729 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LYNDA +++$+++ Well, she's totally not here.
L260102 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
L260101 +++$+++ u5729 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LYNDA +++$+++ Is Annie around?
L260100 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
L260099 +++$+++ u5729 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LYNDA +++$+++ Hi, Laurie, what's up?
L259821 +++$+++ u5729 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LYNDA +++$+++ Totally.
L259820 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.
L259817 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I don't think so...
L259816 +++$+++ u5729 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LYNDA +++$+++ Isn't that David Graham? He's cute.
L259811 +++$+++ u5729 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LYNDA +++$+++ The only reason she babysits is to have a place to...
L259810 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I thought you were babysitting tonight.
L259798 +++$+++ u5729 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LYNDA +++$+++ It's your own fault and I don't feel sorry for you.
L259797 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ As usual, I don't have anything to do.
L259796 +++$+++ u5729 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LYNDA +++$+++ TOTALLY!
L259795 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
L259794 +++$+++ u5729 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LYNDA +++$+++ It's totally insane! We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, I get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. I'll be totally wiped out!
L260191 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ No! Do as I say.
L260190 +++$+++ u5733 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Laurie, you come with us...
L260184 +++$+++ u5733 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ But you can't kill the bogyman.
L260183 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I killed him...
L260182 +++$+++ u5733 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ How?
L260181 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Yes.
L260180 +++$+++ u5733 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Are you sure?
L260177 +++$+++ u5733 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Was it the bogyman?
L260176 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.
L260169 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ HURRY!
L260168 +++$+++ u5733 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ It's the bogyman, isn't it?
L260167 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
L260166 +++$+++ u5733 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ I'm scared...
L260165 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
L260164 +++$+++ u5733 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ What is it, Laurie?
L260163 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...
L260162 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Tommy, let me in!
L260161 +++$+++ u5733 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Who is it?
L260059 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I said, stop it! There is no bogyman. There's nothing out there. If you don't stop all this, I'm turning off the TV and you go to bed.
L260058 +++$+++ u5733 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ I saw him...
L260057 +++$+++ u5726 +++$+++ m379 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.
