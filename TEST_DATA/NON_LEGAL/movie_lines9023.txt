L140752 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.
L141691 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ No, I want my cut!
L141690 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What do you want? An apology?
L141689 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You tell them the "Tale".
L141671 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ You sold me out. You should have trusted me like I trusted you. You fucked up. You fucked up HUGE.
L141670 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee? Because it is all about the money, right?
L141625 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it.
L141624 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ You got my cell. Leave a message.
L141551 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you.
L141550 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Sorry. I didn't know...
L141502 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I'm going to say this one last time for you, so take a deep breath and count to ten. There is no cut.
L141501 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ No, I want my cut!
L141500 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology?
L141499 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ What about the money?
L141498 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What about what?
L141497 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ What about...
L141496 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
L141495 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Everyone's working an angle, right?
L141494 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
L141493 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ You are such a raving pussy sometimes.
L141483 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.
L141482 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Jesus... Take it easy.
L141424 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.
L141423 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
L141422 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way.
L141421 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Did, uh... Did you kill him?
L141420 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ After Glenn was finished, he gave me a couple of valiums and I went home. The next day, I finished my shift and met him around back, like we always did. I stuck a number eight scalpel into his chest. Three or four times.
L141419 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Lily... Jesus Christ...
L141418 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.
L141417 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to "fuck some sense into me."
L141416 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ He was looking out for you.
L141415 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Sort of. I was telling him about this great love of my life who's name I don't remember, and I could see... He was getting pissed. I thought it was just because he was worried about me, but... He told me that I was stupid because my boyfriend didn't really love me.
L141414 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Glenn talked you out of it.
L141413 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him.  What the hell was his name?
L141412 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You guys got busted. This is a great neck.
L141411 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.
L141410 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
L141409 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.
L141408 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?
L141407 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
L141406 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Sounds respectable.
L141405 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Who says you have to know the King to be in a hole? I actually did have a real job once. When I was in high school, I worked as a candy striper.
L141402 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I SAID, HOW DO --  Deal with that?
L141401 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ WHAT?
L141400 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ How do you deal with --
L141396 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Don't ruin this for me.
L141395 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.
L141394 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Intuition.
L141393 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ How do you know I will?
L141392 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
L141391 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
L141390 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.
L141389 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ It's more than that.
L141388 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
L141387 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
L141386 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
L141385 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
L141384 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
L141383 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Do you have something to prove?
L141382 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
L141381 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
L141380 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ It's what I do. It's my job.
L141379 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
L141378 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ For what? A couple hundred bucks?
L141377 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Look at you... You want to go.
L141365 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
L141364 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...
L141286 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Did I miss something?
L141285 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
L141284 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ You told me to change my hair!
L141280 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house...
L141279 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Lighten up.
L141278 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You just put a mother of a jinx on us.
L141253 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L141252 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ I gotta go get a haircut.
L141251 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L141250 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ He's gone.
L141219 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
L141218 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Uh... Everything okay?
L141197 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Then show me how.
L141196 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I don't trust anyone.
L141195 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ You're just going to have to trust me.
L141194 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
L141193 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Why?
L141192 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ And some new clothes.
L141191 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ What?
L141190 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You need to get a haircut.
L141189 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ It's just that I left my asshole decoder ring at home, so how do I know not to worry?
L141188 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Don't worry about it.
L141187 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ What the hell's his problem?
L141117 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
L141116 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Mr. King, I think --
L141106 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
L141105 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
L141104 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I'll worry about Customs.
L141103 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ What about Customs?
L141016 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Just play a part. A little acting.
L141015 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ What do I have to do?
L141014 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You get an equal cut.
L141013 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ No.  What's my cut?
L141012 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I just have a good feeling about you. Haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before?
L141011 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
L141010 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious.
L141009 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
L141008 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
L141005 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going?
L141004 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.
L141003 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me.
L141002 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Says who?
L141001 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
L141000 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy.  Jake.
L140999 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You interested in a little work?
L140998 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ That's not --
L140994 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ We're not cops.
L140993 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ What is this? You guys cops or something?
L141561 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Jake? Customs?
L141560 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ And we got rid of the red head.
L141559 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ And we got rid of the red head.
L141558 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.
L141492 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Do you even remember Al? Do you remember what he looked like sitting there?
L141491 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Escorts!
L141490 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ No, no, no! Not this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You with the hookers!
L141485 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk.
L141484 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What do we do? We change the scam?
L141329 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!
L141328 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, "You're fired! Your whole team's fired!" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo --
L141269 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Where the hell is she?
L141268 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
L141151 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You sure?
L141150 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Him.
L141141 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
L141140 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.
L141102 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker.
L141101 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Is it all fugasi?
L141060 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I'm getting clear of this. If you're not going to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money. Gordo?
L141059 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
L141058 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ We're getting a little old for running.
L141057 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
L141056 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
L141055 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ We never had a problem with that before.
L141054 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
L141053 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
L141052 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs.
L141044 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Good point.
L141043 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
L141042 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What?
L141041 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Uh...
L141024 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
L141023 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Why?
L140991 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Breasts.
L140990 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What do we need another Shill for?
L140989 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill.
L140986 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Wait a second... Who's the mope?
L140985 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ We're working for the King.
L140977 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Now you're an accomplice in a homicide. Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg.
L140976 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You better hurry. The police will be here any second.  I don't really understand my motivation with this. Why am I washing glasses?
L140882 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I'm getting a ride.
L140881 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
L140880 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Meet me at my place later.
L140875 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Just mail it to the hospital.  Mr. King, please. It's regarding an accounting problem. Yes... Correct... I know where it is. That will be fine. Thank you.
L140874 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Do we want insurance?  I'm just asking...
L140862 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ He'll find us. We go talk to him.
L140861 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
L140860 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ It's bad luck.
L140840 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Sorry. I'm just... Look what they did to him. Right in the middle of his egg-foo-young.
L140839 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Miles...
L140838 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I was supposed to meet him for breakfast. He likes that new IHOP they just opened, you know... He likes to order that thing. The Rutti- Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got.
L140837 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You better get over to Al's. Now.
L140836 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Yeah.
L140781 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You sure we're clear?
L140780 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Stop waving that thing around.
L140767 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ My place.
L140766 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Then shut up.

It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later...
