You can either feel lonely -- you know, the hate -- or --  So you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some John you've never seen before, but he wants you. He must, he's paying for it.  And usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not; you know this thing. And then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you're all there is.  And it's not real and you don't have to even like them -- you can even hate them, it's all right, it safe -- you know?

L336010 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
L336009 +++$+++ u6212 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ SPANGLER +++$+++ You think people hate you.

And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something?

L336243 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
L336242 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
L336241 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?
L336240 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Will you let me go then?
L336239 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.

L336232 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ You have no idea what I'm talking about.
L336229 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ All right, then, an ordinary matter. I'm a quite well off man, I have a -- position to respect. I would feel personally uncomfortable to be connected with a -- certain kind of woman, I'm sure you understand. Do you? Well I'd like to buy Jane McKenna's book.
L336228 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ -- Yes.

L336280 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
L336279 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ OK.
L336278 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.
L336276 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.
L336275 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ What?
L336274 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ They don't scare me any more.

L335845 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
L335844 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
L335843 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
L335842 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
L335841 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
L335840 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
L335839 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Arlyn Page.
L335838 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I've checked the records of Jane McKenna's death -- I can't get anything special. But Frank Ligourin had another girl you said, besides McKenna and you.
L335837 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ When?
L335836 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ You asked if there was anything more you could help me with.
L335826 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Well what're you down about? You mean because you didn't get me there?  You can't expect that. I mean Frank, yes, he'd get me there all the time -- but never with a John.
L335825 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Thanks.
L335824 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ What's the matter hon? You were great. Terrific. A tiger.
L335819 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --
L335818 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.
L335816 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ So you're not too different from him, or the chap on the roof, or Tommy-baby --
L335815 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Mm.
L335814 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
L335813 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Not much point to this, is there?
L335812 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Oh, don't be a doo-doo.
L335811 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof.
L335810 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ It's kind of late.
L335807 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Goodbye.
L335806 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know --  -- too bad? Pathetic?
L335805 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ -- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
L335804 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Yeah, you got to me.
L335803 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
L335802 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Well --
L335801 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
L335800 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ No, I said what did you think.
L335799 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ You said it was!
L335798 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ And I don't think that was Tom.
L335797 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
L335796 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Try some other ways. 
L335795 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ What're you gonna do next?
