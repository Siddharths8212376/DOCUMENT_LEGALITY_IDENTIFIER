L135161 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Her fucking body fell out!
L135160 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ So the casket fell over! Big deal!
L135159 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
L135158 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
L135157 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
L135156 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
L135155 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I can't fucking believe you!!
L135154 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Nobody's there. It's four o'clock on a Saturday. How many people ever come to the store at four on a Saturday?
L135153 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in.
L135152 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Listen to you.
L135151 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I know it was a bad idea to close the store.
L135149 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ I never tried it.
L135148 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
L135147 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ What, your dick?
L135146 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ You know.
L135145 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Reach what?
L135144 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I could never reach.
L135143 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Yeah, but at what a price.
L135142 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ He made it, hunhh?
L135141 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Balls resting on his lips.
L135140 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ His dick was in his mouth?
L135139 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ My cousin? My aunt found him. On his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. Dick in his mouth. My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.
L135138 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Who found him?
L135137 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
L135136 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
L135135 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
L135134 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ No!
L135133 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
L135132 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Oh, my god.
L135131 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ I swear.
L135130 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Stop it.
L135129 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Bible truth.
L135128 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Shut the hell up.
L135127 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ He broke his neck trying to suck his own dick.
L135126 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ That's embarrassing?
L135125 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Broke his neck.
L135124 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ How'd he die?
L135123 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
L135122 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ An embarrassing way to die.
L135121 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ An embolism in a pool.
L135120 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Twenty-two; same as us.
L135119 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ She was pretty young, hunhh?
L135118 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend.
L135117 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ You were saying?
L135116 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Exactly, which means I can't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake.
L135115 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
L135114 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I can't close the store.
L135113 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ I'm going with you.
L135112 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I'm not taking you to this funeral.
L135111 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
L135110 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ She meant nothing to you!
L135109 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ If you go, I go.
L135108 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
L135107 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
L135106 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ You hate people.
L135105 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
L135104 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Stop it. This is beneath even you.
L135103 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
L135102 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ You hardly knew her!
L135101 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
L135100 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
L135099 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ One night only. She's buried in the morning.
L135098 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Shit. What about tomorrow?
L135097 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
L135096 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ What!?
L135095 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ It's today.
L135094 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Why not?
L135093 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ No, you're not.
L135092 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I'm gonna go to her wake.
L135091 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ You've had sex with a dead person.
L135090 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Number six.
L135089 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
L135088 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I haven't seen her in almost two years.
L135087 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
L135086 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Jesus.
L135085 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
L135084 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ How? When?
L135083 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
L135082 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Oh, my god.
L135081 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ No, I'm serious.
L135080 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Yeah, right.
L135079 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Julie Dwyer died.
L135078 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
L135077 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ You know what Sanford told me? 
L135076 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ "It's not like we're gonna sell out."
L135075 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
L135074 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Exactly. They drank it all.
L135073 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ What happened to all the Gatorade?
L135072 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Gatorade.
L135071 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
L135070 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
L135069 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
L135068 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
L135067 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Helluva game!
L134994 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Then where're we gonna play?
L134993 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ We're not playing in the street.
L134992 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
L134991 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
L134990 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Are you gonna lock the store?
L134988 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Can we not talk about this?
L134987 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Design major.
L134981 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here.
L134980 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ He's blunt, but he's got a point.
L134972 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I just want to play hockey like I was scheduled to.
L134971 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ No argument here. Insubordination rules.
L134970 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
L134969 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
L134968 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Pull my laces tighter.
L134964 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ You've got a customer.
L134963 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ At least we're stuck here together.
L134962 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
L134961 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ See? There you go again.
L134960 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Sorry.
L134959 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Don't yell at me, pal.
L134958 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
L134957 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Because you buckled.
L134956 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I'm going to miss the game.
L134955 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
L134954 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ You know what pisses me off the most?
L134953 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
L134952 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I don't back down.
L134951 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
L134950 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I know.
L134949 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
L134948 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ What?
L134947 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Why'd you apologize?
L134946 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ FUCK!
L134945 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ So, what-you're stuck here all day?
L134944 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
L134943 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
L134942 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Can you believe this?!
L134941 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Vermont?
L134937 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ The best Burtless movie ever made.
L134936 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
L134935 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call.
L134913 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Shut up!  Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not happy about it, but I've been able to deal.
L134912 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Thirty-seven!
L134904 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Veronica!
L134903 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
L134902 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
L134901 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Why not?
L134900 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ No.
L134886 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ All of them.
L134885 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Which ones?
L134884 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
L134883 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade.
L134882 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ The milkmaids?
L134881 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ The milkmaids.
L134880 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Let's hear it.
L134879 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
L134878 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
L134877 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ There aren't.
L134876 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
L134875 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
L134874 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
L134873 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
L134872 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
L134871 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.
L134862 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ The jizz-mopper's job is to clean up the booths afterward, because practically everybody shoots a load against the window, and I don't know if you know or not, but cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it right away.
L134861 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Can we talk about this later?
L134860 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.
L134859 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ What kind of show?
L134858 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Oh, it's great. You step into this little booth and there's this window between you and this naked woman, and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks.
L134857 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I guess not.
L134856 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
L134855 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Nudie booth?
L134854 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
L134853 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ What's a jizz-mopper?
L134852 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
L134851 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie.
L134833 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I'll give him five more minutes then I'm calling the cops. I don't need this, man. I'm not even supposed to be here today.
L134832 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
L134831 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
L134830 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ What did he say?
L134829 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I told him that and he yelled at me.
L134828 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Why doesn't he just mix and match?
L134827 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Obviously not. Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade.
L134826 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ The quest isn't going well?
L134825 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Each egg has to be perfect.
L134824 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Perfect dozen.
L134823 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
L134822 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ What's he looking for?
L134820 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ This guy is going through all of the eggs. Look.
L134819 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ She's in here?
L134818 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Wait.
L134817 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said...
L134774 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ All those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed- casualties of a war they had nothing to do with.  All right, look-you're a roofer, and some juicy government contract comes your way; you got the wife and kids and the two-story in suburbia-this is a government contract, which means all sorts of benefits. All of a sudden these left-wing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a three-mile radius.  You didn't ask for that. You have no personal politics. You're just trying to scrape out a living.
L134773 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
L134772 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.
L134771 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.
L134770 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.
L134769 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ So?
L134768 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.
L134767 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ And the second time around...?
L134766 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.
L134765 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Basically.
L134764 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
L134763 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ And you figured it out?
L134762 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
L134761 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
