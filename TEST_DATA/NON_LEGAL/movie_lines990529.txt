L665198 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What's the deal?
L665197 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ Sorry, "dude".
L665195 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ Is this what you're looking for?
L665194 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
L665193 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
L665192 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Dude, what are you doing here?
L664970 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Yeah, thanks a lot.
L664969 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ I'll leave you two alone to talk.
L664903 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ The corner. Anarchy 99.
L664902 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Nice hops.
L664900 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two, I don't wanna be here either, so just step off. Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out, I'm gonna get some rest.
L664899 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.
L664898 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Here we go again.
L664897 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.
L664896 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand.
L664895 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ Sit down.
L664824 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.
L664823 +++$+++ u8999 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ VIRG +++$+++ They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?
L664818 +++$+++ u8999 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ VIRG +++$+++ It's like you said, every man for himself.
L664817 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Help me with this guy.
L664803 +++$+++ u8999 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ VIRG +++$+++ He's a pretty good actor, though.
L664802 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
L664780 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ A parachute. This does not argue well.
L664779 +++$+++ u8999 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ VIRG +++$+++ Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
L664775 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Been to any good diners lately?
L664774 +++$+++ u8999 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ VIRG +++$+++ What's so damn funny?
L665272 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
L665271 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --
L665268 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it.
L665267 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.
L665266 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
L665265 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Including rape, pillage, murder.
L665264 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
L665263 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
L665262 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
L665261 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.
L665258 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.
L665257 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
L665256 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
L665250 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
L665249 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ That was for Anders.
L665067 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ You want to insult me? This is my hospitality. Pick one.
L665066 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
L665065 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl.
L665059 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ My old man, he bought into the system, and it screwed him. So he swallowed a bullet. Me, I don't believe in nothing I can't see and touch.
L665058 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
L665057 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
L665056 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
L665055 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.
L665054 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
L665053 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.
L665033 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Easy. You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss.
L665032 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
L665031 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.
L665030 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ "...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
L665029 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."
L665028 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.
L665027 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.
L665026 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You wanna see my politics?
L665025 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
L665024 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What's "Anarchy 99"?
L665023 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!
L665020 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Had to do what I had to do.
L665019 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!
L665014 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
L665013 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
L665012 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
L665011 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ What's going on, my friend?
L665004 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ This is a gift. From me to you.
L665003 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What's this?
L665002 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Of course.
L665001 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I had to inspect the merchandise first.
L665000 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem...
L664999 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Very nice. I'm impressed.
L664940 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ It'll work faster if I have an account number.
L664939 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
L664930 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
L664929 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
L664926 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ When else are you gonna do it?
L664925 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour.
L664919 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don't know about 'em, who does?
L664918 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
L664917 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.
L664916 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. Whatever you want, the rest of the night, consider it on the house.
L664915 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
L664914 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
L664910 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Who you workin' for? What do you do for a living, dickhead?
L664909 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ This pizda? Never seen him before.
L664908 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ That's the guy.
L664564 +++$+++ u9009 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ STORM +++$+++ Beast.
L664563 +++$+++ u9002 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ BEAST +++$+++ Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
L664562 +++$+++ u9009 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ STORM +++$+++ We all do.
L664561 +++$+++ u9002 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ BEAST +++$+++ I wish I could go.
L664555 +++$+++ u9009 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ STORM +++$+++ ... until he found tungsten.
L664554 +++$+++ u9002 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ BEAST +++$+++ Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
L664509 +++$+++ u9002 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ BEAST +++$+++ The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
L664508 +++$+++ u9009 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ STORM +++$+++ What does that mean?
L664559 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
L664558 +++$+++ u9002 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ BEAST +++$+++ Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
L664557 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ For what purpose?
L664556 +++$+++ u9002 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ BEAST +++$+++ Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
L664553 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ Its core?
L664552 +++$+++ u9002 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ BEAST +++$+++ It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
L664511 +++$+++ u9002 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ BEAST +++$+++ I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
L664510 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ Can the Professor repair his own mind?
L664610 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.
L664609 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ Jean... can you?
L664595 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ Storm, Rogue, -- you take the south entrance.  Jean and I will go in here.
L664594 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ It's too far.
L664593 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?
L664575 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L664574 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Into the Hudson?
L664573 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down.
L664570 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ He calls me sport one more time, and I'll blow a watermelon-sized hole through him.
L664569 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ What's that?
L664568 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ I'll tell you one thing though.
L664567 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
L664566 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
L664515 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
L664514 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Are you all right?
L664513 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ We have to find Magneto.
L664512 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ He's already losing control of his vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.
L664503 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
L664502 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ What's wrong with him?
L664396 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose it's our responsibility to do something.
L664395 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
L664394 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L664393 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ I don't like him being here.
L664392 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Scott.. I -
L664642 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ Sure you are, sport.
L664641 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.
L664427 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Shut up.  I got no interest in you, Xavier,  or your... X-Men.
L664426 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ You know, you --
L664425 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
L664423 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?
L664422 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ How long have you been in Alaska?
L664419 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ I wanted to talk to you.
L664418 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
L664482 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Yeah, I'll bet you have.
L664481 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I've seen a lot of rings.
L664480 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Logan, do you see this ring?
L664478 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?
L664477 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ He takes himself seriously.
L664476 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ He takes his work seriously.
L664475 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ He's uptight.
L664474 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Suit yourself.
L664473 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Let go.
L664472 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Not interested.
L664471 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What do you say?
L664470 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Were you now?
L664469 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
L664468 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ He's busy right now.
L664467 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ You should always work with a spotter.
L664390 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What if they're naughty?
L664389 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ If necessary.
L664388 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ By reading my thoughts?
L664387 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
L664386 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
L664385 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.
L664384 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What if I like the pain?
L664383 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
L664382 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I won't light the cigars - how about that?
L664381 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
L664380 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Some cigars.  Case of beer.
L664379 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Anything else I can get you?
L664537 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
L664536 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
L664526 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Tell it to the ones that did this to me.
L664525 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.
L664524 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...
L664519 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Senator?
L664518 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Dr. Grey.
L664268 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
L664267 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.
L664266 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey.  A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him.  I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off.  You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.  But what you presume to tell this committee -
L664265 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Control, Senator...  we teach them control.
L664264 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
L664263 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
L664262 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
L664259 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator.  The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.
L664258 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are mutants dangerous?
L664319 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ Let's just say, God works too slowly.
L664318 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ What is it you intend to do to me?
L664317 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
L664316 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ The intention of registration act -
L664312 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ Gosh, I hope so.
L664311 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Whatever you do to me... no matter what you'll make me right.  Every word I have spoken will be confirmed.
L664310 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You mutant bastards...
L664309 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
L664308 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
L664580 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?
L664579 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L664578 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ You're backstage at the encore of creation.
L664577 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Where am I?
L664497 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
L664496 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ Come with me and I'll let her live.
L664495 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What do you want?
L664494 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ I do love a good check mate.
L664654 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What?... miss me?  Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.
L664653 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ Why?  You have a home here now, if you want it.  Everyone will...
