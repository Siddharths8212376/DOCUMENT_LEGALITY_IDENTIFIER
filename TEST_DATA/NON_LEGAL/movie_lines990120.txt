L380079 +++$+++ u6570 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CASTILLO +++$+++ ...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
L380078 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ You need to consider a few issues.
L380052 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ They knew about Alonzo, <u>before</u> he made a move on them.  They had our operation.  They've cut into us.
L380051 +++$+++ u6570 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CASTILLO +++$+++ Tell them what you want.
L380050 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ Not anymore.  This is a distribution network out of South Florida, moving poly-drug loads, crystal meth through coke, to Nashville, Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland.  And computer fraud, identity theft. It's like that.
L380045 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ We're not certain!
L380044 +++$+++ u6570 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CASTILLO +++$+++ You said Nazi Low-riders...?
L380043 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ We're not certain...
L380504 +++$+++ u6571 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ COLEMAN +++$+++ Deal.
L380503 +++$+++ u6573 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ EL TIBURON +++$+++ Make it 35.
L380502 +++$+++ u6571 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ COLEMAN +++$+++ Make it 40%.
L380501 +++$+++ u6573 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ EL TIBURON +++$+++ 25% discount on the load.
L380500 +++$+++ u6571 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ COLEMAN +++$+++ My end?
L380499 +++$+++ u6573 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ EL TIBURON +++$+++ Two main players plus three.
L380498 +++$+++ u6571 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ COLEMAN +++$+++ How many?
L380497 +++$+++ u6573 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ EL TIBURON +++$+++ And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
L380496 +++$+++ u6571 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ COLEMAN +++$+++ I got the item.
L380495 +++$+++ u6573 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ EL TIBURON +++$+++ Okay.  You got the "item"?
L380494 +++$+++ u6571 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ COLEMAN +++$+++ All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.
L380493 +++$+++ u6573 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ EL TIBURON +++$+++ Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
L380492 +++$+++ u6571 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ COLEMAN +++$+++ So...?
L380588 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ It still is.  I'm so in this, I don't know which way is up... All I know is I won't let anything bad happen to you.  Just like I said.  And I know we can't ever see each other again.  And we never will.
L380587 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ I know.  And now?
L380586 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ No part of it wasn't real.
L380584 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ No.
L380583 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail?  You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?
L380554 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ ...it's gonna be an L-shaped ambush.  They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors, 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They <u>will</u> wait till they got the goods before they do the deed.
L380553 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ If they attack you...
L380525 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Maybe.  Maybe with the crazy whites.
L380524 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Yero, by himself?
L380479 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ I'll be on board by noon.
L380478 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ ...in the morning.
L380477 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Would you?  Because if you couldn't, I would be very lonely... I would have left the only world I know and have known since I was seventeen.  But none of this will happen.  So it doesn't matter.  Because we are on the Guajira Peninsula.  And all you see around you...look around... is Archangel de Jesus Montoya- Londono.  He is my man.  And you are a smuggler moving a load...
L380476 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
L380475 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
L380474 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
L380473 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Is this the protective male talk?
L380472 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
L380471 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Where would I go?
L380470 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Of course.
L380469 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Would you find me...?
L380468 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Whenever.  Maybe later, maybe sooner.
L380467 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ When?
L380466 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.
L380465 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Really?
L380464 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them.  So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run...
L380463 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ 'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...?
L380462 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
L380461 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Do I need it?
L380460 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ ...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
L380459 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Why?
L380458 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts?
L380457 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ In Kowloon, once, I got one that said, "Live now because life is dust."
L380456 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
L380455 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ What's the best fortune you ever got?
L380454 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
L380453 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ I forgot the napkins.
L380424 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Hola, viejo.
L380423 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Hola, chica.
L380342 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Maybe I'm only one.
L380341 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
L380340 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
L380339 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Twenty-eight-point-five.
L380338 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Available cash is not an issue for us...
L380337 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front...
L380336 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E....to even consider it.
L380334 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ And you're our thirty-percent partner?
L380333 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ 'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
L380332 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ 'Cause you don't lose loads?
L380331 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Zero risk.
L380330 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Good samba dancing...?
L380329 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
L380328 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Did Christmas come early this year...?
L380327 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ What do you mean?
L380326 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Is it December?
L380325 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Cost less.  That's the point.
L380324 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ And why should continuing excellence cost more?
L380323 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers.
L380322 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Like...?
L380319 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Exactly.
L380318 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ ...and therafore there is no consequence?
L380317 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ That's right.
L380316 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ ...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
L380315 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ "Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
L380314 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ You know how improbable this is...?
L380313 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ To mothers.  And all that we owe them...
L380312 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Died in childbirth, having me...
L380311 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Blanca...a rubio like you.  I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.  ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone...  She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance.  Your mother?
L380310 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Okay.  Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know, now...it's all business...
L380309 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ I insist.
L380308 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ No.
L380307 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Tell <u>me</u> everything.
L380305 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ I dance...
L380304 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Later!  Do you dance?
L380303 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Mojitas...?
L380302 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel...  And I can do anything I want...
L380301 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ How's he not your husband?
L380300 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Angolan Military.  Went back to the fighting.  Disappeared.  Who knows...?
L380299 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Your father?
L380298 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ She's dead...
L380297 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Where's she now?
L380296 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
L380295 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Were you born in Havana?
L380294 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ I never do business in Cuba.  And nobody goes to Cuba but me.  And he is not my husband...
L380293 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ You do business in Cuba with your husband?
L380292 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...
L380290 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
L380289 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
L380288 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Havana.
L380287 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ The Keys?
L380286 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
L380285 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Where's that?
L380284 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
L380283 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ So where's the best place for mojitas?
L380279 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Show me...?
L380278 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ It goes very fast.
L380277 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ How fast does that go?
L380276 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ I'm a fiend for mojitas.
L380275 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ What do you like to drink?
L380273 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ And what is that?
L380272 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...
L380263 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Nothing.  As in "free, gratis."
L380262 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ What's "nothing"?
L380259 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ What's the recovery?  How much are you looking for?
L380258 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Okay.
L380257 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ We want it back.
L380185 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Right now.
L380184 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ When?
L380183 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ You do.
L380182 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ I thought we had to meet the Man.
L380176 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Really?  So, what is this, a party?
L380175 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.
L380514 +++$+++ u6577 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ JOSÉ YERO +++$+++ 'Cause she will tell you.
L380513 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?
L380512 +++$+++ u6577 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ JOSÉ YERO +++$+++ Mrs. Rico.  But don't worry.  She is safe.  To insure that, I am keeping her close to me.  It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you.
L380511 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ What friend?
L380510 +++$+++ u6577 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ JOSÉ YERO +++$+++ I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view.  I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now...
L380509 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ You got something to say, José, let's hear it.
L380508 +++$+++ u6577 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ JOSÉ YERO +++$+++ Hey, Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I have second thoughts.
L380507 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Yeah?
L380440 +++$+++ u6577 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ JOSÉ YERO +++$+++ Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.
L380439 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Packaging?
L380256 +++$+++ u6577 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ JOSÉ YERO +++$+++ Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load...
L380255 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?
L380254 +++$+++ u6577 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ JOSÉ YERO +++$+++ What'd Neptune tell you?
L380253 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours?
L380249 +++$+++ u6577 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ JOSÉ YERO +++$+++ And what do I do with him?
L380248 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Yeah.
L380243 +++$+++ u6577 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ JOSÉ YERO +++$+++ I'll be there.
L380242 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ He tried to..."do business"...with you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be there.
L380241 +++$+++ u6577 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ JOSÉ YERO +++$+++ I do.  We don't do business with him...
L380240 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ "Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?
L380239 +++$+++ u6577 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ JOSÉ YERO +++$+++ Client got delivery.  But there were..."extras" in the back of the truck.
L380144 +++$+++ u6577 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ JOSÉ YERO +++$+++ I'm also called "Cochi Loco."  That means "Crazy pig."  'Cause I enforce security and get people to tell me what I need to know.  That part of what I do, you never want to find out about.  Other people will negotiate the money and go or not go.  Not me...
L380143 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Red light, green light, José?
L380136 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ I am not John Wayne.  There is no "S" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money.
L380135 +++$+++ u6577 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ JOSÉ YERO +++$+++ You afraid of violence?
L380118 +++$+++ u6577 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ JOSÉ YERO +++$+++ Who you run loads for?  Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you?
L380117 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ What...?
L380113 +++$+++ u6577 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ JOSÉ YERO +++$+++ Sit.
L380112 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico.
L380111 +++$+++ u6577 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ JOSÉ YERO +++$+++ José...
L380486 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Call the US Coast Guard:  "Come and arrest our ass."  And Switek resumes romancing Miss Ukraine...

L380484 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ What's your take?
L380444 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ And José, my ace, lots of transshipment.  Lots of action. Skies are crowded.  And the JIT has assets on land, air, and sea.  So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...?
L380443 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy...

L380373 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Their loads are poly-drug.  "E" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan "H." Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network.
L380370 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow...
L380369 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?

L380361 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Oh, that makes it okay, then.
L380360 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ We're makin' moves on each other.
L380359 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ You're not makin' a move on her...?
