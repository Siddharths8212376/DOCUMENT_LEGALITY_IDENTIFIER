L628222 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ What do you think, eightball?
L628221 +++$+++ u8640 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ What department?
L628220 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.
L628219 +++$+++ u8640 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Look, Dick, I don't -
L628218 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -
L628217 +++$+++ u8640 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
L628216 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.
L628213 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Unloading? That's a helluva way to describe the bargain of a lifetime.
L628212 +++$+++ u8640 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ - that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
L628211 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Leave the gorillas.
L628210 +++$+++ u8640 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Yeah, OK.
L628209 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Want an animal cracker?
L628208 +++$+++ u8640 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading -
L628303 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Like, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick.
L628302 +++$+++ u8636 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CUSTOMER +++$+++ I can see what you mean.
L628301 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps.
L628300 +++$+++ u8636 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CUSTOMER +++$+++ That good, huh?
L628299 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.
L628298 +++$+++ u8636 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CUSTOMER +++$+++ No. Not yet.
L628297 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Have you read the story on Elvis?
L628296 +++$+++ u8636 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CUSTOMER +++$+++ Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.
L628574 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room.
L628573 +++$+++ u8645 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Wanna count your money?
L628564 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I bullshitted him.
L628563 +++$+++ u8645 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
L628562 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ We grew up together.
L628561 +++$+++ u8645 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Why does he trust you?
L628560 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
L628559 +++$+++ u8645 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
L628554 +++$+++ u8645 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Bastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys.
L628553 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ A Norms in Van Nuys.
L628552 +++$+++ u8645 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Where'd you go?
L628547 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
L628546 +++$+++ u8645 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
L628545 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Me too, Boris.
L628544 +++$+++ u8645 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
L628543 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Now, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more.
L628531 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books.
L628530 +++$+++ u8645 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
L628529 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
L628528 +++$+++ u8645 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Thank you very much, Clarence.
L628527 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you "Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies. After "Apocalypse Now" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.
L628526 +++$+++ u8645 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
L628525 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
L628524 +++$+++ u8645 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody.
L628523 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these "Soldier of Fortune" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll put the gun on the table.
L628262 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire.
L628261 +++$+++ u8645 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to "Doctor Zhivago" are in arbitration?
L628260 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.
L628259 +++$+++ u8645 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.
L628257 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.
L628256 +++$+++ u8645 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I don't know, Clarence, "Doctor Zhivago" is a pretty big movie.
L627787 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around.  I love you son.
L627786 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ We do make a cute couple, don't we?
L627785 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
L627784 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Keep it.
L627783 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ I got some money I can give you -
L627782 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.
L627781 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ Naw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou had a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it.
L627780 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
L627779 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
L627778 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Who is he?
L627777 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
L627776 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Nope.
L627775 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
L627774 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ No shit?
L627773 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
L627772 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Do tell. Why drug related?
L627771 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.
L627755 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.
L627754 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ You got it all worked out, don't you?
L627753 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I'm your son.
L627752 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ What makes you think I would do that?
L627751 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ You were a cop.
L627750 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ What makes you think I could do that?
L627749 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
L627748 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ Yes, I still have friends on the force.
L627747 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Do you still have friends on the force?
L627746 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
L627745 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ What?
L627744 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ What do you want from me?
L627743 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ You're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes. Making jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a joke about this -  - I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head!
L627742 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Look, I don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel free.
L627724 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Daddy, I'm in big fuckin' trouble and I really need your help.
L627723 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
L627722 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
L627721 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ She seems very nice.
L627720 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
L627717 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ You don't know the chicken places around where you live?  Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.
L627716 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ I really don't know.
L627715 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
L627714 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ I'm really not very -
L627711 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Get a six-pack of something imported. It's hard to tell you what to get 'cause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get that, if not, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has. Look, since you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a foot run as well. I'm fuckin' starvin' to death. Are you hungry too?
L627710 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
L627709 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Go to the liquor store -  Where is there a liquor store around here?
L627705 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ That's about all I ever eat.
L627704 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ I can, but I don't.
L627703 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
L627702 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ I think there's a Seven-Up in there.
L627878 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?
L627877 +++$+++ u8635 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ COCCOTTI +++$+++ Come again?
L627876 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ You know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I find that shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, Sicilians were spawned by niggers.
L627875 +++$+++ u8635 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ COCCOTTI +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L627874 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ Oh, don't bother. I got one.  So you're a Sicilian, huh?
L627872 +++$+++ u8635 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ COCCOTTI +++$+++ Sure.
L627871 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
L627868 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ They didn't tell me.
L627867 +++$+++ u8635 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ COCCOTTI +++$+++ I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
L627866 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ On their honeymoon.
L627865 +++$+++ u8635 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ COCCOTTI +++$+++ That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
L627864 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ I don't believe you.
L627863 +++$+++ u8635 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ COCCOTTI +++$+++ I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.
L627862 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ What are you talkin' about?
L627861 +++$+++ u8635 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ COCCOTTI +++$+++ Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
L627860 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ I've seen him.
L627858 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence -
L627857 +++$+++ u8635 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ COCCOTTI +++$+++ I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
L627856 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ No.
L627855 +++$+++ u8635 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ COCCOTTI +++$+++ I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?
L627854 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.
L627853 +++$+++ u8635 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ COCCOTTI +++$+++ I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard od us before. Am I correct?
L627852 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ I give up. Who are you?
L627851 +++$+++ u8635 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ COCCOTTI +++$+++ Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?
L627770 +++$+++ u8653 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got myself a new place - mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place. I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla.
L627769 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ You and Robin moved?
L627768 +++$+++ u8653 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
L627767 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
L627766 +++$+++ u8653 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ McTeague.
L627765 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?
L627764 +++$+++ u8653 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?
L627763 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.
L627762 +++$+++ u8653 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ What about him?
L627761 +++$+++ u8634 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.
L627740 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
L627739 +++$+++ u8651 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ RAVENCROFT +++$+++ I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
L627738 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Where'd he come from?
L627737 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Absolutely.
L627736 +++$+++ u8651 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ RAVENCROFT +++$+++ Could we try it now?
L627735 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Sure. No problem.
L627734 +++$+++ u8651 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ RAVENCROFT +++$+++ If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?
L627733 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Thank you.
L627732 +++$+++ u8651 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ RAVENCROFT +++$+++ That was very good.
L627731 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
L627730 +++$+++ u8651 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ RAVENCROFT +++$+++ I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
L627729 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Where'd you come from?
L627728 +++$+++ u8651 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ RAVENCROFT +++$+++ Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.  And what you're trying to do is get him off.  Whenever you're ready.
L627727 +++$+++ u8651 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ RAVENCROFT +++$+++ Step inside.
L627726 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ I'm me... I mean, that's me.
L628379 +++$+++ u8638 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DIMES +++$+++ Look, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire department, the L.A. Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the twelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust.
L628378 +++$+++ u8644 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ KRINKLE +++$+++ Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.
L628377 +++$+++ u8638 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DIMES +++$+++ We talked him into it.
L628376 +++$+++ u8644 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ KRINKLE +++$+++ He'll wear a wire?
L628373 +++$+++ u8638 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DIMES +++$+++ I believe he believes him.
L628372 +++$+++ u8644 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ KRINKLE +++$+++ Do you believe him?
L628371 +++$+++ u8638 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DIMES +++$+++ Sure was.
L628370 +++$+++ u8644 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ KRINKLE +++$+++ That was a good fuckin' movie.
L628369 +++$+++ u8638 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DIMES +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L628368 +++$+++ u8644 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ KRINKLE +++$+++ That Vietnam movie?
L628353 +++$+++ u8638 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DIMES +++$+++ Okee-dokee. It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for speeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. So they bring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him.
L628352 +++$+++ u8644 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ KRINKLE +++$+++ Both you, idiots shut up, I can't understand shit! Now, what's happened, what's going on, and what are you talking about?
L628496 +++$+++ u8638 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DIMES +++$+++ You're an actor, so act, motherfucker.
L628495 +++$+++ u8650 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ NICHOLSON +++$+++ Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.
L628491 +++$+++ u8638 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DIMES +++$+++ This guy's gonna kill him.
L628490 +++$+++ u8650 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ NICHOLSON +++$+++ He's bluffin ya, Elliot. Can't you see that? You're an actor, remember, the show must go on.
L628484 +++$+++ u8638 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DIMES +++$+++ Whatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator.
L628483 +++$+++ u8650 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ NICHOLSON +++$+++ We gotta get him outta there.
L628478 +++$+++ u8638 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DIMES +++$+++ He knows something's up.
L628477 +++$+++ u8650 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ NICHOLSON +++$+++ How's he supposed to see the wire?
L628476 +++$+++ u8638 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DIMES +++$+++ He saw the wire.
L628475 +++$+++ u8650 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ NICHOLSON +++$+++ How the fuck could he know?
L628474 +++$+++ u8638 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DIMES +++$+++ He knows.
L628435 +++$+++ u8638 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DIMES +++$+++ Hope you're a good actor, Elliot.
L628434 +++$+++ u8650 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ NICHOLSON +++$+++ You do.
L628433 +++$+++ u8638 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DIMES +++$+++ You do more than try.
L628428 +++$+++ u8650 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ NICHOLSON +++$+++ So you gotta get him to admit on tape that he's buying this coke.
L628427 +++$+++ u8638 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DIMES +++$+++ We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.
L628426 +++$+++ u8650 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ NICHOLSON +++$+++ Like gang-busters. Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail.
L628375 +++$+++ u8638 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DIMES +++$+++ This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.
L628374 +++$+++ u8650 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ NICHOLSON +++$+++ He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.
L628367 +++$+++ u8638 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DIMES +++$+++ He produced "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
L628366 +++$+++ u8650 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ NICHOLSON +++$+++ To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
L628365 +++$+++ u8638 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DIMES +++$+++ Suspect's words -
L628357 +++$+++ u8638 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DIMES +++$+++ So we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. And, Krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin' believe it.
L628356 +++$+++ u8650 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ NICHOLSON +++$+++ Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.
L628355 +++$+++ u8638 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DIMES +++$+++ Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.
L628354 +++$+++ u8650 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ NICHOLSON +++$+++ Nicholson and I.
L628351 +++$+++ u8650 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ NICHOLSON +++$+++ Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion -
L628350 +++$+++ u8638 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DIMES +++$+++ Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts  cryin', and then it was all over -
L628348 +++$+++ u8650 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ NICHOLSON +++$+++ That is, of course, if you don't catch Aids from all your anal intrusions.
L628347 +++$+++ u8638 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DIMES +++$+++ 'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -
L628346 +++$+++ u8650 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ NICHOLSON +++$+++ And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman.
L628345 +++$+++ u8638 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DIMES +++$+++ But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
L628344 +++$+++ u8650 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ NICHOLSON +++$+++ You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
L628343 +++$+++ u8638 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DIMES +++$+++ Or a supporting actor -
L628342 +++$+++ u8650 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ NICHOLSON +++$+++ Or a bit player -
L628341 +++$+++ u8638 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DIMES +++$+++ You're no longer an extra -
L628340 +++$+++ u8650 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ NICHOLSON +++$+++ You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time -
L628339 +++$+++ u8638 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DIMES +++$+++ No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
L628338 +++$+++ u8650 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ NICHOLSON +++$+++ But a fuckin' baggie.
L628337 +++$+++ u8638 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DIMES +++$+++ Not a tiny little vial -
