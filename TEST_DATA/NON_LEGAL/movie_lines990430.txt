L609582 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Millionaires, man.
L609581 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ It'd make their heads explode.
L609580 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they knew.  We're going to be millionaires, man.  Millionaires!
L609579 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ You can't tell anybody about this.
L609578 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
L609577 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ What?
L609576 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Let's go.
L609575 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
L609574 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ She okay?
L609547 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
L609546 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Steady it out!
L609538 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.
L609537 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
L609532 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ It's the only way.  We drive!
L609531 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ They're not going to--
L609530 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
L609529 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ They'll shoot us!
L609525 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ We can see them, they can see us.  We run, they chase.
L609524 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
L609523 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
L609517 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS!
L609516 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Wh-what do you think--
L609515 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Take the binoculars.
L609513 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ You know, you sound just like a boy who's never--
L609512 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
L609511 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
L609510 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Oh, that's fun.
L609509 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Invest it.
L609508 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
L609507 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels?
L609504 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ A car?  You're going to buy a car?
L609503 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.
L609502 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Third.  What you're going to do with your third.
L609499 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
L609498 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way.
L609481 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Cool it, Jaeger.  Hey, Wes?  Wes?
L609480 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?
L609473 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Roger that.
L609472 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Now this is war.
L609470 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.
L609469 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all right.
L609462 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ But we all got to be in for this.  We all go, or we do nothing.
L609461 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
L609460 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off--
L609447 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ What we're doing is kicking ass.  For God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering to news crews.  The war is over.  We've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers.
L609446 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ And you know what that area is?  It's Iraq.  IRAQ!  We're doing a little thing with them right now; Desert Storm.  Maybe you've read about it.
L609443 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this stuff.
L609442 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
L609441 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
L609440 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
L609439 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Wait.  Wait.
L609438 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Don't even.  You're not going to show me that tired map.
L609426 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ I'd like to go home alive with a couple of Iraqi scalps hanging from my belt.
L609425 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
L609424 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.
L609401 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes.  Let's get out of here.  We got sand to protect.
L609400 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ You think?
L609386 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ I did it!  I got the box open.
L609385 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ What!?  What!?
L609384 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ OH MY GOD!
L609383 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ You all want to lay off?  God.  I hope the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.
L609380 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ I've got to have something to tell people when I get home besides I protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place.
L609379 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
L609378 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ This is stupid.  It's going on a month now.  How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards?  They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?
L609343 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ There might be.
L609342 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
L609341 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ There might be something in there.
L609340 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
L609327 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.
L609326 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
L609298 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Another month in this desert and I might just.
L609297 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Blow me.
L609296 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ You know what?  I think you got Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the General right in the ass.  Now that's good shooting.
L609294 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ No you're not.
L609293 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
L609292 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
L609291 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
L609290 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Knock it off!
L609289 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ At-at-at-at-at.
L609282 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ What does it look like I'm doing?  I'm killing Iraqis.  At-at-at-at-at.  At-at- at-at--
L609281 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ What are you doing?
L609280 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.
L609416 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Saddam's got a boil on his ass?
L609415 +++$+++ u8411 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WOODS +++$+++ They're all good ones.  Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.
L609414 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Some good ones.
L609413 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ The photos.
L609412 +++$+++ u8411 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WOODS +++$+++ Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
L609411 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Just...want to be ready when we do.
L609410 +++$+++ u8411 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WOODS +++$+++ Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
L609409 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ I could use some recon photos too.
L609408 +++$+++ u8411 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WOODS +++$+++ That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing.
L609405 +++$+++ u8411 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WOODS +++$+++ A map?  All I got is maps.  I'm gonna have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here.  What kind of map you need?  Topographical, geographical, thermal?
L609404 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.
L609403 +++$+++ u8411 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WOODS +++$+++ Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
L609402 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Woods.
L610156 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ You actually got around to killing someone.  I'm impressed.  I guess you're only half a bitch.
L610155 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
L610154 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs.  They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy.  America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out:  They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert.  They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something.  And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis.  See how I mean?
L609988 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.
L609987 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
L609986 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler.  That's why they wear them.
L609985 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ You're going to burn up in those.
L609967 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ You want to say some words?
L609966 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him.
L609946 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ He'd just slow us down, and drink our water.  And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.
L609945 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.
L609936 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ I'm not wasting my water on him.
L609935 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ I think he wants something to drink.
L609934 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ All last night he could have been--
L609933 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Maybe we should give him some water.
L609927 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ He lived through that?
L609926 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
L609921 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.
L609920 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
L609855 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ I think we found something.
L609854 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ What the hell are you doing!?
L609825 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ What do you see?
L609824 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Yeah, we're down.
L609823 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ You down?
L609817 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Guess we know what the next stop is.
L609816 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ It's got a bottom.
L609812 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Lines up with the map and the photos.
L609811 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ What do you think?
L609788 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
L609787 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
L609767 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ We make it, or we go back empty handed.
L609766 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Think we can make it?
L609755 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.
L609754 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
L609753 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
L609752 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ We're American soldiers.  We don't abandon people.
L609744 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ We have to do something.
L609743 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ So?
L609740 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ I know you're a pussy.  I know that.
L609739 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ Is there anything you do know?
L609736 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
L609735 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
L609720 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Anytime you want to do something about it just let--
L609719 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
L609716 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you.
L609715 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.
L609701 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ You want to crawl, crawl.
L609700 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
L609699 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
L609698 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
L609697 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ How long we going to keep this up.
L609668 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.
L609667 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Epps...
L609610 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ You have to go with us.  You can't walk back...
L609609 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
L609608 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ You have to go with us, Wes.
L609607 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ You two don't even know how crazy you are.  You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.
L609602 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ As soon as we hit the mountain we would have had to go on foot anyway.  We're not that far.  We can make it.
L609601 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ Then lets go back while we still can.
L609600 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ We're not stranded.  We've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back.
L609595 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ ...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.
L609594 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
L609561 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ We just about got killed.  You know what happened?  We just about got killed, and you want to go on?
L609560 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.
L609559 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ We have to go back.
L609558 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ We got to get out of here.
L609557 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Yeah, well, we're not.
L609556 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ I thought we were dead.
L609536 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ You see that?  Right by us.  They went right by.  You had them Epps; you called it.
L609535 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.

L609506 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--
L609505 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
L609501 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ You know what I'm doing with my half?
L609500 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ If there's gold.  If!
L609497 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ How the hell should I know how much?
L609496 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
L609495 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
L609494 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?
L609493 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ If!  If there's a treasure.
L609492 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Hey, Wes, what kind of treasure you figure these people buried?
L609486 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ Oh, no.

L609468 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Yes!
L609467 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.
L609465 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ You're insane if you think you'll find anything, and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive.
L609464 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ You know it's real.  You know it's real, and you know it's there.  You know it.
L609463 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ Epps, you're smarter than this.  Jaeger I understand, but you're smarter.
L609454 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ So you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase?  It's crazy.  Tell him it's crazy, Epps.
L609453 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.
L609452 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
L609451 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
L609450 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
L609449 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
L609448 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
L609436 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ With...with millions.  Millions of dollars.
L609435 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ What?
