L325815 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Not too good in daylight ..
L325814 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ What does that mean?
L325813 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ O.K.
L325812 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ How's the new residence?
L325810 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Since when did you drink diet soda?
L325809 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..
L325806 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is <u>French</u> champagne.
L325805 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Not for me ..
L325802 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ A professional, whining, con-person bitch with an ass the size of Africa ..
L325801 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Who is who?
L325762 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
L325761 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Yeah, he can go ...
L325755 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Two dogs. He should do the dogs.
L325754 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ The <u>dogs</u>?
L325753 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs?
L325751 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I think you're here all day.
L325750 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ What do you think?
L325745 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Oh, shit. Of course. The kid.  <u>Travis</u>. Find that kid and get the knife off him. He's gonna lie to you - but he's got it - so <u>get</u> it. Well, go on, get on with it. Whatta you staring at?
L325744 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ What about that kid, Ross?
L325743 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Watch my lips, coz you're not gonna believe this - <u>this</u> is a rare occurrence. We haven't had a body in eighteen months.
L325742 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing?
L325731 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed ..
L325730 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Mr Blattis, of our local news- paper. You sure it's a suicide?
L325727 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ "Welcome to Eureka."
L325726 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist."
L325725 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ You heard. Look for the knife.
L325724 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him? You need some hands up here to look ..
L325717 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife.
L325716 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Be my guest. What you got?
L325715 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I hope I'm not intruding?
L325714 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Did you bring it with you?
L326462 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I am calm .. <u>I am calm</u> ..
L326461 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
L326460 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I'll sign anything you want. <u>Please</u>. Bring here her .. <u>I want Helena here</u> ..
L326312 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ Coz I'm <u>short of men</u> & Ang- elo won't do it .. Who ever I got free first - <u>you</u> <u>get</u> ..
L326311 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
L326310 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ Alright, you got it. And I'll be putting an Observer in with you.
L326117 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ No.
L326116 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ And did they?
L326115 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I never asked if he could "see." I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything?
L326114 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ He says, you freaked one of em out?  "Asking a newly blind kid if he can 'see,' is both cruel, and dangerous" ..
L326113 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ That's bullshit,
L326112 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
L326111 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Once.
L326110 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ I'm talking, outside the girl?
L326109 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Three or four.
L326108 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute?
L326107 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
L326106 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ I'm shutting you down on this "blind thing," John.
L326046 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ We have a body part in suspicious circumstances - a tailor's dummy wearing a brassiere - <u>and a bill</u> <u>for seventeen dollars for its wig</u>!
L326045 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
L326044 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ I <u>have</u> heard you. You just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part ..
L326043 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..
L326042 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ She's <u>not</u> "missing." Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? <u>No</u>. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John.
L326041 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
L326040 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
L326039 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ No, Sir.
L326038 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ Have you got a print from the hand?
L326037 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ No.
L326036 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ Have you got a match on the bullet?
L326035 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
L326034 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ Then <u>where's the body</u>? .. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?
L326033 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
L326032 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ You're pushing this too hard. It's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?
L325877 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is <u>right</u> <u>now</u>, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..
L325876 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ What do you want me to do, Chief?
L325875 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ Sucked in officers from all over the county. And it was the worst six months this station ever had.
L325874 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I thought it was Taylor's case?
L325873 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ Probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall. He worked a lotta time on this.
L325869 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ Yeah, that's all very inter- esting, but where's the body?
L325868 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I got four points of posit- ive comparison on the cut ..
L325867 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ I don't see that at all ..
L325866 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Yes, Sir, I think they maybe. I think "Jennifer," and this lady got hit by the same guy?
L325865 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ What is all this Jennifer stuff?
L325864 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
L325863 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ How do you know her hair's black?
L325862 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?
L325861 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ What is that?
L325788 +++$+++ u6123 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ CITRINE +++$+++ That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
L325787 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Why did he ask if it was frozen?
L325778 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Maybe he's lying to you?
L325777 +++$+++ u6122 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BLATTIS +++$+++ Kid told me he didn't take it?
L325776 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ No .. But we have a theory ..
L325775 +++$+++ u6122 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BLATTIS +++$+++ Did you find the knife, Sergeant?
L325772 +++$+++ u6122 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BLATTIS +++$+++ Popeye wasn't old. Younger than you.
L325771 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
L325770 +++$+++ u6122 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BLATTIS +++$+++ Did he get you the job?
L325767 +++$+++ u6122 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BLATTIS +++$+++ Average rainfall, 48 inches. Pisses down, October to June.
L325766 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Is this normal?
L325741 +++$+++ u6122 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BLATTIS +++$+++ Your predecessor. He did- n't like to get outta bed. Catch you later, Freddy T ..
L325740 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?
L325739 +++$+++ u6122 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BLATTIS +++$+++ Alright, gentlemen, I'm gonna leave you. I got a couple of questions for the paper, Serg- eant? Mind if I swing by later, wring out a tea-bag with you?
L325733 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Cut your own throat, you're ner- vous about it, tend to hesitate. He's got three trial cuts, lower left side of the neck, before he works up courage for the big one.
L325732 +++$+++ u6122 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BLATTIS +++$+++ What does that mean, Sergeant?
L325729 +++$+++ u6122 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BLATTIS +++$+++ Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
L325728 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.
L326425 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ You <u>haven't</u>. And you got no voice in here, Taylor, <u>so keep it shut</u>.
L326424 +++$+++ u6128 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ I've heard you call him Freddy.
L326423 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life ..
L326413 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ He ain't offerin me shit.
L326412 +++$+++ u6128 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ He's offerin you a deal? Why don't you take it ..
L326178 +++$+++ u6128 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Well, her, it ain't. That bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat.
L326177 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I know what a "witness" is.
L326176 +++$+++ u6128 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ <u>If</u>, your friend from San Diego was up here, and thought for <u>one</u> out of <u>two fucken seconds</u>, she was a danger to him, he'da taken her out weeks ago ..
L326175 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ You don't know what you done, Taylor.
L326169 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Just walk away from me, Taylor ..
L326168 +++$+++ u6128 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.
L326167 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Don't you know nothing about this guy? He <u>reads</u> the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..
L326166 +++$+++ u6128 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Bullshit.
L326165 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ So read it! You just hung a target around her neck!
L326164 +++$+++ u6128 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Alright, I gave him the case? .. So the case is closed, so what?
L326163 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
L326162 +++$+++ u6128 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
L326161 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ <u>You</u> put it in there.
L326160 +++$+++ u6128 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ His blind friend got "attacked." Angelo went up there, and some- how, it got itself in the paper.
L326145 +++$+++ u6128 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Wrong cabinet.
L326144 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Vehicle references.
L326143 +++$+++ u6128 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ What are you looking for?
L326142 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ .. feel like I'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time, feel like I'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J ..
L326130 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ How come he's suddenly so forth- coming? I'd like to kick him right in the ass. If he'd discussed it with me, I mighta gotten somewhere ..
L326129 +++$+++ u6128 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Yeah, in and outta Frisco on the big boats .. Every lead we had went right out to sea .. Night, night, Freddy T .. John ..
L325909 +++$+++ u6124 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ GOODRIDGE +++$+++ I see .. Well, she's teaching an- other class at four .. I'd apprec- iate it if you don't detain her ..
L325908 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
L325907 +++$+++ u6124 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ GOODRIDGE +++$+++ As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
L325906 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Yes, Sir.
L325899 +++$+++ u6124 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ GOODRIDGE +++$+++ Then you could have saved yourself a lot of driving, Sergeant. What I said on the phone's the same as I'm saying now. I got no idea where Amb- er is, or who it was took her there.
L325898 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
L325897 +++$+++ u6124 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ GOODRIDGE +++$+++ Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
L325896 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
L325895 +++$+++ u6124 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ GOODRIDGE +++$+++ As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber?
L326421 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ It's not as bad as it sounds .. They can't refuse me bail. Raise bail of my own cognizance & find the best damned lawyer there is ..
L326420 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ I don't want them to arrest you.
L326419 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I think they're gonna arrest me.
L326418 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ I wanna be near you ...
L326417 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart ..
L326408 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ I'm blind because my father drank.
L326407 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ You do?
L326406 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ I know about alcohol, John.
L326405 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ He doesn't need my help.
L326397 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Then why didn't he kill me?
L326396 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ He don't know that. I didn't.
L326395 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ I can't identify him ..
L326394 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Coz he thinks you're a witness.
L326393 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Why does he want to kill me?
L326392 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up at the in- stitute to <u>kill you</u> - he don't wanna kill Rose - he was there to <u>kill you</u> - that's the truth - and I didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's - coz I can't protect you here ..
L326391 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ <u>Then explain it to me</u>. I got enough darkness, don't I?
L326390 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
L326389 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u>  ..
L326294 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ No .. not now ..
L326293 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ I'm going back to the institute.
L326292 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ She has an aunt, in Vermont. I'll take her there tonight.
L326287 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now ..
L326286 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Why?
L326285 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ It's not possible right now.
L326284 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Why can't I stay with you?
L326205 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
L326204 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?
L326203 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ No I'm not.
L326202 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ You're looking worried again, Helena?
L326201 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Who?  Probably Angelo .. I'll take care of it .. Don't worry, we- 're gonna find this guy, and everything'll be O.K. .. O.K.?
L326200 +++$+++ u6125 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
L326199 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Has he got your aunt's address?
