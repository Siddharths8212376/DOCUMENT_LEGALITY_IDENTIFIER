L446924 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ Get it in half an hour.
L446923 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Got the information on you?
L446922 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ Got it on you?
L446921 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ A thousand.
L446920 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
L446919 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ You mentioned information.
L446918 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
L446917 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ For two hundred?
L446916 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ I go home and paint the kitchen.
L446915 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ For five hundred, what do I get?
L446914 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ Bluff. You've waited too long.
L446913 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
L446912 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the price to be a thousand.
L446911 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I don't know whether to knock your teeth down your throat--or call the police--or just give you twenty bucks to go out and buy yourself a clean nose.
L446910 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.
L446909 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ That's a nice hard knee you've got, Goble. How'd you like to trade it for a broken neck?
L446908 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.
L446907 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
L446906 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ $40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
L446905 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ What are your rates?
L446904 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
L446903 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Private eye?
L446902 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ Information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio.  That's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, I get hired not to work.  Nice girl you were with last night. Known her long?
L446901 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Name it.
L446900 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
L446899 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I'm still asking. What do you want?
L446898 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ You asked for it.
L446897 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Nice friendly approach you've got. Goble. I could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning.
L446892 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I'm not interested in blind dates.
L446891 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ I'd like a few words with you, in private.
L446668 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ That comedian?
L446667 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
L446666 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly.  How long do we have to wait for this police character?
L446662 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ They still hang women in Canada, I've heard.
L446661 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Leave that one lay.
L446660 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ And without much discrimination.
L446659 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Sometimes.
L446658 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You make friends quickly, don't you, Clark?
L446524 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ You, Killaine?
L446523 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Martini.
L446522 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ What'll you have, Margo?
L446521 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Fascinated.
L446520 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Let me introduce you. Mr.  Killaine, Mrs. West.
L446519 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
L446518 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?
L446848 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.
L446847 +++$+++ u7097 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ What's this in favor of?
L446846 +++$+++ u7097 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble.
L446845 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ How are your teeth getting along?
L446844 +++$+++ u7097 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ I've got good ears.
L446843 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Who told you my name?
L446842 +++$+++ u7097 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?
L446841 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ So you're not a cop.
L446840 +++$+++ u7097 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ What's a buzzer?
L446839 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ All right, let's see the buzzer.
L447211 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Oh.  That was just one of those idle questions.  One doesn't expect an answer.
L447210 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ You asked me where it all came from.
L447209 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ What?
L447208 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I had a father who knew how to steal.
L447207 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Where did it all come from?  Or is that a permissible question?
L447206 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
L447205 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
L447204 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
L447203 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
L447202 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Wait a minute.  I'll go with you.
L447201 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
L447200 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ You forgetting the gag line, Killaine.  The police don't take anything for granted.
L447198 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Where would she go, anyway.  Don't tell me you haven't got her covered.
L447197 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ No more for me, thanks.  Remember what I said.  I can't interfere with the law.
L447181 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ No idea.
L447180 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
L447179 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
L447178 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
L447177 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Mitchell was too drunk.
L447176 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ She didn't have to.  He could have climbed down from here.
L447175 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
L447174 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
L447173 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ And old man Clarendon?  He had a motive, too.  Margo and her money.
L447172 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Your concentrating too hard, Killaine.  What about Margo West? She had a motive.  I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?
L447171 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
L447170 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ That COULD BE TOLD.
L447169 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ It could have been an accident.
L447168 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
L447167 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Information.
L447166 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
L447165 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ The only answer I have for you.
L447164 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Doesn't answer the question.
L447163 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You'd be breaking the law.
L447162 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Would that make me a heel?
L447161 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
L447160 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ That must hurt.
L447159 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I have a warrant for her arrest.
L447158 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ A couple of hours.
L447157 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
L447156 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Could we discuss that some other time?
L447155 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ "Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
L447154 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I wouldn't know.
L447153 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
L447152 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I never notice the view after the first week.
L447151 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?
L447149 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Thanks.  I don't mind.
L447148 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
L447147 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Time for a little chat?
L446807 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Well--good night.
L446806 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I don't.
L446805 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ In case you want to have us followed.
L446784 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something, I know less than I did before.  Well, I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.
L446783 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ How are you two getting along?
L446726 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for, say, half and hour?
L446725 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ How about a cup of coffee?
L446713 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ We do, when we get the chance.
L446712 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.
L446711 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ It was lying where on the balcony?
L446710 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ No.
L446709 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
L446708 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Could be.
L446707 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Quite sure you had no motive?
L446706 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
L446705 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Where?
L446704 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Yes, I've seen it before.
L446703 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Thank you.
L446580 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ That's what I thought, at first.  Maybe somebody else ought to have thrown this party.  With my liquor of course.
L446579 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
L446578 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
L446577 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Hardly. Who's the girl?
L446576 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Would it have helped if I'd knocked him down?
L446544 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ If I can get off.
L446543 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Round of golf Saturday?
L446542 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ The usual grind.
L446541 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ How's life treating you?
L446540 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
L446530 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ You're not English.
L446529 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.
L446528 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ A private joke.
L446527 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ What?
L446566 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.
L446565 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
L446564 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
L446563 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ How would you know, Brandon?
L446562 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.
L446561 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Did I do something wrong?
L446560 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Do me a favor, Mitchell. Find yourself a nice secluded park bench.
L446498 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Lay off what? This is my new girl friend. Met her on the train. She's very fond of me. Love at first sight. Wasn't it, baby?
L446497 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Lay off, can't you?
L446496 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore?
L446495 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.
L446494 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
L446413 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies.
L446412 +++$+++ u7090 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CAMPBELL +++$+++ I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell.
L446411 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I'm afraid this is all for the moment.
L446410 +++$+++ u7090 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CAMPBELL +++$+++ Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
L446409 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ A little something on account perhaps?
L446408 +++$+++ u7090 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CAMPBELL +++$+++ Mr. Mitchell.
L446407 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.
L446761 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why.
L446760 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
L446759 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ With what motive?
L446758 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
L446757 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
L446756 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.
L446755 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ Convenient, isn't it?
L446754 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
L446753 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.
L446752 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ He saw my face too.
L446751 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
L446750 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ That's not enough.
L446749 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ I'm a very observant man. You had something in your bag this afternoon, Something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. Something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. You went out with Mitchell. None of us ever saw him again.
L446748 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ Sardonic, if you will my dear. Bust nasty. You lied about the gun.
L446747 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You nasty, sardonic--
L446746 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.
L446745 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Don't be a fool. I loved him. He wasn't worth it, but I loved him.
L446744 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.
L446743 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Passkey?
L446742 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys.
L446741 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ What do you want?
L446740 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ I don't think you locked your door.
L446739 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L446664 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.
L446663 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
L446355 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ I see out friend Larry Mitchell is with us again.
L446354 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I'm getting positively haggard. In a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved.
L446715 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ Thank you. It is rather late... and I'm not young anymore. Good night.
L446714 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I needn't keep you any longer, Mr. Clarendon.
L446699 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Thank you.
L446698 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
L446697 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Recently, then.
L446696 +++$+++ u7091 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ CLARENDON +++$+++ I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
L446695 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
L447401 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ We don't need him.
L447400 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
L447399 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ What's the face for, Driscoll?
L447146 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Men like you don't need orders.
L447145 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
L447144 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ The Super's just given me the sweetest dressing down I've ever had.  I'm still reeling from it. And believe me, I had it coming. I apologize.  What you think is important--I think is important.
L447143 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.
L447142 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.
L447141 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ If you're asking my opinion, no. I'd read it to Greer over the phone. Ask him if he had any objections.
L447140 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Would you?
L447139 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ Send that?
L447138 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police.
