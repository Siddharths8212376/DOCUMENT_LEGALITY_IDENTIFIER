L27803 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You're not going, are you?
L27769 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ It couldn't possibly interest you.
L27768 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
L27762 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Well...
L27761 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Try...
L27760 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ If I only knew how...
L27729 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ My husband...
L27728 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Hello, Miss Channing.
L27725 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Not at all.  Margo, this is Eve Harrington.
L27724 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I thought you'd forgotten about me.
L27679 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Eve. Eve Harrington.
L27678 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
L27677 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
L27676 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ There isn't another like you, there couldn't be-
L27675 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ No, I'd be imposing on her, I'd be just another tongue-tied gushing fan...
L27674 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ She's got to meet you-
L27673 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh, no...
L27672 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I'm going to take you to Margo...
L27671 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Standing room doesn't cost much. I manage.
L27670 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You see the play? You've seen the play every performance?  But, don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?
L27669 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh, no. I see the play.
L27668 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
L27667 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ He's the best.
L27666 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
L27665 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
L27664 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
L27663 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
L27662 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Not at all.
L27661 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I hope you don't mind my speaking to you...
L27660 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Why should you be? After all, six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater-
L27659 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Why should you think I wouldn't be?
L27658 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ So there you are. It seemed odd, suddenly, your not being there...
L28359 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...
L28358 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo, let me tell you about Eve-
L27821 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
L27820 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
L27773 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Farmers were poor in those days, that's what dad was - a farmer. I had to help out. So I quit school and I went to Milwaukee. I became a secretary. In a brewery.  When you're a secretary in a brewery - it's pretty hard to make believe you're anything else. Everything is beer. It wasn't much fun, but it helped at home -  and there was a Little Theater Group... like a drop of rain in the desert. That's where I met Eddie. He was a radio technician. We played 'Liliom' for three performances, I was awful - then the war came, and we got married. Eddie was in the air force - and they sent him to the South Pacific. You were with the O.W.I., weren't you Mr. Richards?  That's what 'Who's Who' says... well, with Eddie gone, my life went back to beer. Except for a letter a week. One week Eddie wrote he had a leave coming up. I'd saved my money and vacation time. I went to San Francisco to meet him.  Eddie wasn't there. They forwarded the telegram from Milwaukee - the one that came from Washington to say that Eddie wasn't coming at all. That Eddie was dead...  ... so I figured I'd stay in San Francisco. i was alone, but couldn't go back without Eddie. I found a job. And his insurance helped... and there were theaters in San Francisco. And one night Margo Channing came to play in 'Remembrance'... and I went to see it. And - well - here I am...
L27772 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Not at all...
L27771 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I guess it started back home. Wisconsin, that is. There was just mum, and dad - and me. I was the only child, and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that I couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?
L27764 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ 'Remembrance'.
L27763 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Well... it started with the play before this one...
L27754 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Let's get back to this one. Have you really seen every performance?  Why? I'm curious...
L27753 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.
L27752 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ How'd hear about it?
L27747 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I'd like anything Miss Channing played...
L27746 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
L27745 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ No, thank you.  Yes. I've seen every performance.
L27731 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ How do you do, Mr. Richards.
L27730 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Hello, Miss Harrington.
L28355 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
L28354 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
L28353 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Why not?
L28352 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...
L28351 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Really, Eve? Why?
L28350 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Miss Channing, I can't tell you how glad I am that you arrived so late.
L28341 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ How are you making out in Mr. Fabian's office?  I don't want you working the child too hard, Max - just because you promised. As you see, I kept my promise, too...
L28340 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Hello, Miss Channing.
L28339 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Terribly sorry I'm late, lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab - where's Miss Caswell, shall we start? Oh, hello, Eve...
L28210 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I had no idea you knew each other.
L28209 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Good evening, Mr. deWitt.
L28174 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.
L28173 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is there anything else I can do?
L28141 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Of course.
L28140 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Some snowy night in front of the fire... in the meantime, while we're on the subject, will you check about the hors d'oeuvres? The caterer forgot them, the varnish wasn't dry or something...
L28139 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I'd like to hear it.
L28101 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I wouldn't like.
L28100 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ If you'd like.
L28079 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-
L28078 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother.
L28013 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Mr. Sampson's birthday. I certainly wouldn't forget that. You'd never forgive me.  As a matter of fact, I sent him a telegram myself...
L28012 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
L28011 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home...
L28010 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
L28009 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
L28008 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
L28007 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ That's my job.  See you at tea time...
L28006 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
L28005 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Right here.
L28004 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ - and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
L28003 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I've got it.
L28002 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ There's the script to go back to the Guild-
L28001 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?
L28000 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me...
L27999 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?
L27998 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
L27997 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Well - what do you think of my elegant new suit?
L27927 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ No trouble at all.
L27926 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be along for it in a minute.
L27925 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ While you're cleaning up, I'll take this to the wardrobe mistress-
L27922 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ They are lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?
L27921 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ The curtains. I made them myself.
L27920 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Well, you've done so much... what's new?
L27919 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
L27914 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ When he gets too close, I'll spit in his eye.
L27913 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night...
L27912 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Well, teacher's away and actors will be actors...
L27911 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I mean the performance. Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around...
L27910 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
L27909 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I must say you can certainly tell Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.
L27908 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Performance number one thousand of this one - if I play it that long - will take place in a well-padded booby hatch...
L27907 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time-
L27906 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ What - again?
L27809 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I won't be a minute.
L27808 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Well - if I'm not in the way...
L27807 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Stick around. Please. Tell you what - we'll put Stanislavsky on his plane, you and I, then go somewhere and talk.
L27806 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ The four of you must have so much to say to each other - with Mr. Sampson leaving...
L27805 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ No, don't go...
L27766 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ San Francisco. It was the last week. I went one night... the most important night in my life - until this one. Anyway... I found myself going the next night - and the next and the next. Every performance. Then, when the show went East - I went East.
L27765 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Did you see it here in New York?
L27757 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Not with you in them. Not by Mr. Richards...
L27756 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ There are other plays...
L27755 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Well. If I didn't come to see the play, I wouldn't have anywhere else to go.
L27751 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Of course it is.
L27750 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr. Richards. I think that part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it, Mr. Richards?
L28813 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You'll be there, won't you.
L28812 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I remember.
L28792 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Very classy stuff, lots of technique-
L28791 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Check.
L28790 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ But not right away? First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...
L28789 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ With tears.
L28788 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ With tears?
L28720 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Well... all right.
L28719 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Karen, in all the years of our friendship, I have never let you go to the Ladies' Room alone. But now I must. I am busting to know what goes on in that feverish little brain waiting there...
L28630 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ The little witch must have had Indians runners out snatching critics out of bars, steam rooms and museums or wherever they hole up... well, she won't get away with it! Nor will Addison deWitt and his poison pen! If Equity or my lawyer can't or won't do anything about it, I will personally stuff that pathetic little lost lamb down Mr. deWitt's ugly throat...
L28629 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Lloyd says it's a publicity release...
L28628 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ In this rat race, everybody's guilty till they're proved innocent! One of the differences between the Theater and civilization...  ... what gets me is how all of those papers in town happened to catch that particular performance!
L28627 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I can't believe Eve said those things!
L28626 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ It get better! "- About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say - younger - actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity-"
L28625 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I just can't believe it.
L28624 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ "... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington. I am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." ... I thought that one went out with Woollcott...  Down here... here, listen to this- "... Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our Theater of permitting, shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory-"
L28534 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Don't give it another thought, one of destiny's many pranks. After all, you didn't personally drain the gasoline out of the tank...
L28533 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ This. I can't tell you how sorry I am!
L28532 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ About what?
L28531 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Margo.  Margo, I want you to know how sorry I am about this...
L28530 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Let's not fumble for excuses, not here and now with my hair down. At best, let's say I've been oversensitive to... well, to the fact that she's so young - so feminine and helpless. To so many things I want to be for Bill... funny business, a woman's career. The things you drop on your way up the ladder, so you can move faster. You forget you'll need them again when you go back to being a woman. That's one career all females have in common - whether we like it or not - being a woman. Sooner or later we've all got to work at it, no matter what other careers we've had or wanted... and, in the last analysis, nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turns around in bed - and there he is. Without that, you're not woman. You're something with a French provincial office or a book full of clippings - but you're not a woman...  ... slow curtain. The end.
L28529 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Well...
L28528 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too.
L28527 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
L28526 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
L28525 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Isn't that what they always say?
L28524 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Not to you. Not to Bill.
L28523 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
L28522 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
L28521 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's fought with her, worked with her, loved her... but ten years from now - Margo Channing will have ceased to exist. And what's left will be... what?
L28520 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Why should he - and why should you?
L28519 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he?
L28518 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ He's in love with you.
L28517 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ What about Bill?
L28516 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What about Bill?
L28515 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ And what is that? Besides something spelled out in light bulbs, I mean. Besides something called temperament, which consists mostly of swooping about on a broomstick creaming at the top of my voice... infants behave the way I do, you know. They carry on and misbehave - they'd get drunk if they knew how - when they can't have what they want. When they feel unwanted and insecure - or unloved.
L28514 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You're Margo. Just - Margo.
L28513 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me...
L28512 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
L28511 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
L28510 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ We've all seemed a little tense lately...
L28509 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend.
L28508 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I detest cheap sentiment.
L28507 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ It doesn't matter.
L28506 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Do you want it on?
L28505 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Be brave. He'll come back - with or without gas.
L28504 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
L28503 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
L28502 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ He always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical-
L28494 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Not many car either, not much chance of a lift...
L28493 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
L28492 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
L28491 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Three or four miles...
L28490 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ How far to the station?
L28489 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Roughly ten minutes.
L28488 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ How much time have we?
L28478 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Peace and quit is for libraries.
L28477 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet-
L28476 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ That little place just two hours form New York. It's on my list of things-I'll-never-understand. Like collecting shrunken Indian heads...
L28184 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I'm so happy you're happy.
L28183 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Margo, nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking Eve in...
L28083 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Please don't play governess, Karen, I haven't your unyielding good taste, I wish I'd gone to Radcliffe too but father wouldn't hear of it - he needed help at the notions counter...  I'm being rude now, aren't I? OR should I say "ain't I"?
L28082 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Margo, really...
L27744 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
L27743 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...
L27741 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I'm so sorry... Harrington. Won't you sit down?
L27740 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Harrington.
L27739 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Dear Birdie. Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?
L27718 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ The heave-ho.
L27717 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ She's just outside the door.
L27716 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You've what?
L27715 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Well... there's one indoors now. I've brought her back to see you.
L27714 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ They're nobody's fans! They're juvenile delinquents, mental detectives, they're nobody's audience, they never see a play or a movie, even - they're never indoors long enough!
L27713 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ They're your fans, your audience-
L27712 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
L27711 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
L27710 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Ain't it the truth?
L27709 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
L27708 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Relax, kid. It's only me and my big mouth...
L27704 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I find these wisecracks increasingly less funny! 'Aged in Wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play-
L27703 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ It's the tight girdle that does it.
L27684 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Hi.  "Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't think you can rightly say we lost the wah, we was mo' stahved out, you might say - an' that's what ah don' unnerstand about all these plays about love-stahved Suth'n women - love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the South!"
L27683 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Hi.  Hello, darling-
L28847 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Then tell me this isn't true! That your concern for your play and career is one thing - and that poor frightened hysterical girl another - and that your concern for her has nothing to do with either your play or your career!
L28846 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!
L28845 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done?
