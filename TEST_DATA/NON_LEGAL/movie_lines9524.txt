L28400 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.
L28399 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I must have frightened her away.
L28398 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Gone.
L28397 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ The kid. Junior.
L28396 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Who?
L28395 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano?  Where is Princess Fire-and-Music?
L28370 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ So full of meaning, fire and music!
L28369 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Addison-!
L28357 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You wouldn't understand.  How was Miss Caswell?
L28356 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ What fire and music?
L28345 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Eve?  How enchanting...  Wherever did you get the idea of having Eve read with Miss Caswell?
L28344 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ The audition.
L28343 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ What's all over?
L28342 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ It's all over.
L28243 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Everybody has a heart - except some people.  Of course I've got bicarb. There's a box in the pantry. We'll put your name on it. Max Fabian. It'll say there. Always. Just for you.
L28242 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ No heart to burn.
L28239 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ If my guests do not like it here, I suggest they accompany you to the nursery where I'm sure you will all feel more at home.
L28238 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side?
L28237 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
L28236 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
L28235 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ It hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you're looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.
L28234 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body. Where has it been laid out?
L28195 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I can always get a fresh one. Karen - you're a Gibson girl...
L28194 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ The kid - junior, that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...
L28193 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Nothing, really...
L28192 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Thank you.
L28171 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Cut! Print it! What happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pit?
L28170 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
L28169 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
L28168 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
L28167 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ - guilty.
L28166 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you - but I'm not going to. I'm too mad-
L28165 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ For instance - you!
L28164 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ For instance what?
L28163 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
L28162 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!
L28161 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Stage-struck kid... she's a young lady - of qualities. And I'll have you know I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if - as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!
L28160 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What of it?
L28159 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Twenty minutes!
L28158 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Of course it's funny - this is all too laughable to be anything else. You know what I think about this - this age obsession of yours - and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because I spent ten minutes with a stage-struck kid-
L28157 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I don't think that's funny!
L28156 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot...
L28155 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
L28154 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play...
L28153 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ So you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young. So young and so fair...
L28152 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ So she seems.
L28151 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
L28150 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ It's a pretty rare quality these days.
L28149 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ She's a girl of so many interests.
L28148 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...
L28147 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ That never stopped you before.
L28146 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
L28145 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I had no idea you were even here.
L28144 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ When I'm guest of honor?
L28143 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I thought you were going to be late-
L28142 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
L28138 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Remind me to tell you about when I looked into the heart of an artichoke.
L28137 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
L28136 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?
L28099 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ To put me to bed? Take my clothes off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn off the lights, tiptoe out...? eve would. Wouldn't you, Eve?
L28098 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Need any help?
L28092 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ This is my house, not a theater! In my house you're a guest, not a director-!
L28091 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Cut it out.
L28090 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Happy little housewife...
L28088 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ It won't play.
L28087 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ It's a good thought.
L28081 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night-  - aren't we, honey?
L28080 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Outside of a beehive, Margo, your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly!
L27978 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ See you...
L27977 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I love you too. Good night, darling-
L27976 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ What?
L27975 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I'll check with Eve...
L27974 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I love you...
L27973 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Okay.
L27972 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ How is Eve? Okay?
L27971 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Yeah... I will.
L27970 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
L27969 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ She did...?
L27968 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
L27967 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
L27966 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I get a party, don't I?
L27965 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Many happy returns of the day...
L27964 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ The reading could have been better, but you said it - now "many happy returns of the day..."
L27963 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Happy birthday, darling...
L27962 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ And who remembered it? Who was there on the dot, at twelve midnight...?
L27961 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Bill... Bill, it's your birthday.
L27960 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Sure! Like the Western Union boys used to do...
L27959 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Sing it?
L27958 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...
L27957 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
L27956 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
L27955 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...
L27954 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ You in a hurry?
L27953 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ - in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...
L27952 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I leave in a week - the picture's all wrapped up, we previewed last night... those previews. Like opening out of town, but terrifying. There's nothing you can do, you're trapped, you're in a tin can-
L27951 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ When - when are you coming back?
L27950 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Then you're crazy.
L27949 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ That I am...
L27948 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ You're my girl, aren't you?
L27947 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
L27946 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do-
L27897 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Call me when you get in...
L27896 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Knit me a muffler.
L27892 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ As of this moment you're six years old...
L27891 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
L27890 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ And cut that out right now.
L27889 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
L27888 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
L27887 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ - you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
L27886 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
L27885 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
L27884 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I'll try.
L27883 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
L27882 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Huh?
L27881 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Bill...
L27880 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...
L27879 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Take care of yourself out there...
L27878 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ All the religions in the world rolled into one, and we're Gods and Goddesses... isn't it silly, suddenly I've developed a big protective feeling for her - a lamb loose in our big stone jungle...
L27877 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I told her. I sounded off.
L27876 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
L27875 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
L27874 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
L27873 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ She's quite a girl, that what's-her name...
L27863 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Byron couldn't have said it more graciously... here we go-
L27862 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Like a nylon lemon peel-
L27861 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Can't keep his eyes off my legs.
L27858 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Where's my coat?
L27857 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
L27856 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Oh well...  ... look through the wigs, maybe it got caught-
L27793 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Heaven help me, I love a psychotic.
L27792 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Hi.  My wonderful junk yard. The mystery and dreams you find in a junk yard-
L27788 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I'm a junk yard.
L27787 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Only in some ways. You're prettier...
L27782 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Show me a human and I might have!
L27781 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? Have you no human consideration?
L27780 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Thank you so much.
L27779 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Forty-five minutes from now my plane takes off and how do I find you? Not ready yet, looking like a junk yard-
L28565 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Only thing, what I go after, I want to go after. I don't want it to come after me.
L28564 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Find out.
L28563 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man...
L28562 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ You hear all kinds of things.
L28561 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
L28560 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ You think?
L28559 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ You're quite a girl.
L28558 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ - and for you.
L28557 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Your make-up's a little heavy.
L28556 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-
L28555 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ When I told you what every young actress should know.
L28554 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.
L28553 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I'm for it.
L28552 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
L28551 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ From what would I be running?
L28550 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Don't run away, Bill.
L28549 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ The names I've been called. But never Svengali.  Good luck.
L28548 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Everything.
L28547 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ What have I got to do with it?
L28546 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ So am I.
L28545 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I'm talking about you. And what you want.
L28544 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Is that what you want me to be?
L28543 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ - after all, the other day was one scene, the woods are full of one scene sensations. But you did it. With work and patience, you'll be a fine actress. If that's what you want to be.
L28542 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ You shouldn't have had any doubts.
L28541 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.
L28540 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Are you proud of me, Bill?
L28539 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ - little things here and there, it doesn't matter. You can be proud of yourself, you've got a right to be.
L28076 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ It means concentration of ambition, desire, and sacrifice such as no other profession demands... And I'll agree that the man or woman who accepts those terms can't be ordinary, can't be - just someone. To give so much for almost always so little...
L28075 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Yes. Yes, it does.
L27895 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.
L27894 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Thanks for your help... good luck.
L27872 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Of course not.
L27871 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind?
L27870 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I have a suggestion.  There's really not much time left - I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet, and - well, I could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket... if you'd like.
L27869 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Ah...
L27851 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ You didn't have to tell me.
L27850 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Every day.
L27849 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Also Addison deWitt.
L27848 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I read George Jean Nathan every week.
L27847 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Yeah. They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards...
L27846 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ So few come back...
L27845 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ It's only one picture deal.
L27844 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.
L27843 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ And I shot my mouth off. Nothing personal, junior, no offense...  ... it's just that there's so much bushwah in this Ivory Green Room they call the Theatuh - sometimes it gets up around my chin...
L27842 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I just asked a simple question.
L27841 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ The Theatuh, the Theatuh-  - what book of rules says the Theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of New York City? Or London, Paris or Vienna?  Listen, junior. And learn. Want to know what the Theater is? A flea circus. Also opera. Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man band - all Theater. Wherever there's magic and make-believe and an audience - there's Theater. Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora Duse. You don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you? The Theater's for everybody - you included, but not exclusively - so don't approve or disapprove. It may not be your Theater, but it's Theater of somebody, somewhere.
L27840 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
L27839 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
L27838 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Is it the money?
L27837 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I don't have to. I want to.
L27836 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Why you have to go out there.
L27835 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Why what?
L27834 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Why.
L27833 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Just wondered what?
L27832 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I just wondered.
L27831 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Why?
L27825 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I told you a lie. We'll make it easily. Margo's got no more conception of time than a halibut.
L27824 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ You said forty-seven minutes. You'll never make it.
L27795 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Eve. Eve Harrington.
L27794 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Hello, what's your name?
L28048 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ They can always grab oranges off trees. This you can't do in Times Square...
L28047 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here-
L28046 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ A diamond collar, gold sleeves - you know, picture people...
