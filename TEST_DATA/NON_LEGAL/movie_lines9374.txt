L504784 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I don't want to talk about it.
L504783 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Just don't give up on Maya. Cool smart chicks like that --they like persistence.
L504779 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Throw me his ball.
L504778 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
L504777 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Fucker hit into us.
L504773 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
L504772 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What is it?
L504771 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile.  Here.
L504770 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
L504769 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Just trying to be helpful.  It's all about stillness, Miles. Inner quiet.
L504768 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Shut up.
L504767 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Don't come over the top. Stay still.
L504765 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say?
L504764 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
L504763 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Huh.
L504762 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Obsessively.
L504761 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Been checking your messages?
L504760 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Could be anything.
L504759 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What do you think's going on?
L504758 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Nope.
L504757 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
L504756 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You're an asshole.
L504755 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Nice shot.
L504753 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Thanks, Jack.
L504752 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
L504751 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Oh yeah. Sure.
L504750 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Can you give me some room here?
L504749 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
L504748 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Nope.
L504747 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
L504745 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy.  This is our day!
L504744 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ That's a public course.  No Stephanie?
L504728 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah.
L504727 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Call me on my cell if you go out.
L504723 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie.
L504722 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay?
L504718 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an actor. All I have is my instinct.  My intuition -- that's all I have. And you're asking me to go against it. And that's just wrong.
L504717 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ That was three years ago after that first party!
L504716 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
L504715 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What? Of course I like Christine.
L504714 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
L504713 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
L504712 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
L504711 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
L504710 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
L504709 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
L504708 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Look who's talking. You've been there.
L504707 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
L504706 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Like I might be in love with another woman.
L504705 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Understanding of what?
L504704 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
L504702 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Deep.
L504701 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes. She's not uptight or controlling. She's just cool. Things are so easy with her. Smells different. Tastes different. Fucks different. Fucks like an animal. I'm telling you, I went deep last night, Miles. Deep.
L504699 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
L504698 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Oh, you've been thinking. And?
L504697 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, I've been doing some thinking.
L504696 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What?
L504695 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
L504694 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Besides what?
L504693 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
L504692 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Does she know about Saturday?
L504691 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ With this chick.
L504690 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What?
L504689 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What the fuck are you doing?
L504688 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
L504687 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Where is Stephanie?
L504684 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What're you drinking?
L504683 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yep.
L504682 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Hey, there you are.
L504679 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool.
L504678 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What'd Christine say?
L504660 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Okay! Jesus!
L504659 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Right now.
L504658 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I will.  See ya!
L504657 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You should call her.
L504656 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah. Okay.
L504655 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ She's been leaving messages here too.
L504654 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Oh, boy.
L504653 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
L504652 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Later.
L504651 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last night, huh? That's a shocker. You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood? You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude.
L504650 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Count me out.
L504649 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
L504648 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ We were supposed to play golf.
L504647 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
L504645 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.
L504644 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.
L504546 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Don't you see how Maya's looking at you? You got her on the hook. Reel her in! Come on, let's rachet this up a notch. You know how to to do it. Here.  Drink some agua.
L504545 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Shut up. Shut your face.
L504544 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ And don't forget all the bad times you had with Victoria. How small she make you feel. That's why you had the affair in the first place.
L504543 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Oh Jesus, Miles.
L504542 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
L504541 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Stop it. You are blowing a great opportunity here, Miles. Fucking Maya, man. She's great. She's cool. She's funny. She knows wine. What is this morose come-down bullshit? These girls want to party. And what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come on!
L504539 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Did you drink and dial?
L504538 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Bathroom.
L504537 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Where were you?
L504536 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I'm fine!
L504535 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Pull yourself together, man.
L504471 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Okay! Fuck!
L504470 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ And don't drink too much. I don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the dark side.
L504469 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
L504468 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
L504467 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
L504466 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Aye-aye, captain.
L504465 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
L504464 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
L504463 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.
L504460 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
L504459 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ So what should I wear?
L504456 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Nah. I want to watch this.
L504455 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
L504454 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And you almost tell her I'm getting married. What's the matter with you?  Gotta love it. Gotta love it.
L504453 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Well, she is cute.
L504452 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on.
L504451 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Been divorced for a year now, bud.
L504450 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ With Maya?
L504449 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
L504448 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What?
L504447 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ We're on.
L504446 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You have the keys.
L504445 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Get the trunk.
L504444 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
L504443 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
L504419 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm a quick learner.
L504418 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
L504411 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
L504410 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
L504409 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
L504408 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
L504407 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
L504406 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What do you think?
L504405 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Is she bringing him to the wedding?
L504404 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
L504403 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I want to go home now.
L504402 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
L504400 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ To that guy? That guy with the restaurant...
L504399 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ About a month ago. Six weeks.
L504398 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ She what?  When?
L504397 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
L504396 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
L504395 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
L504394 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.
L504393 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Miles.
L504392 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
L504391 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Beautiful.
L504390 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Nice, huh?
L504376 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No, see, I want both of us to get crazy. We should both be cutting loose. I mean, this is our last chance. This is our week! It should be something we share.
L504375 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
L504374 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
L504373 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
L504372 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
L504369 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel.
L504368 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ So what's the plan today?
L504367 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?
L504364 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Fuck you.
L504363 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
L504362 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Have you no shame?
L504361 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ She probably went home, lit some candles, put on some relaxing music, took a nice hot bath, and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator.
L504360 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Shut up.
L504359 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
L504358 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock.
L504357 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ How do you know?
L504356 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
L504355 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
L504354 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
L504353 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
L504352 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
L504351 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
L504350 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
L504315 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You're blind, dude. Blind.
L504314 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ She works for tips!
L504313 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
L504312 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
L504311 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Perfect.
L504310 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ And she likes Pinot.
L504309 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
L504308 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Well, she does know a lot about wine.
L504307 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
L504298 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay?  The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
L504297 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
L504296 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
L504295 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her?
L504294 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ And very nice. And very married. Check out the rock.
L504293 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ She is very hot.
L504292 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
L504291 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You know that chick?
L504290 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Sure I know Maya.
L504289 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You know her?
L504288 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
L504286 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ It's going to be great. Here's to us.
L504285 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Here's to my last week of freedom.
L504284 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Pour us a couple.
L504283 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah. Tight.
L504272 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah. It's good. Feels good.
L504271 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Then it's a good thing.
L504270 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It does. Feels right.
L504269 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ If that's what feels right.
L504268 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
L504267 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L504266 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
