L101654 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Any word back from the E.R.s?
L101653 +++$+++ u584 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CHAFFEY +++$+++ Any tips on where these guys may be?
L101652 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one.
L101650 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.
L101649 +++$+++ u584 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CHAFFEY +++$+++ Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
L101615 +++$+++ u584 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CHAFFEY +++$+++ Got it.
L101614 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Look under the body.
L101613 +++$+++ u584 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CHAFFEY +++$+++ I can't find the second one, sir.
L101612 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
L101606 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.
L101605 +++$+++ u584 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CHAFFEY +++$+++ Yes sir.
L102228 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ You gotta keep going.
L102227 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ We're here brother.
L102226 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ You guys?
L102162 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
L102161 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
L102160 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
L102159 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
L102133 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
L102132 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ They got nothing.
L102129 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ What?  What, that guy?
L102128 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Shit.
L102108 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ I know what the fuck he looks like!
L102107 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Look again for fuck sake!
L102086 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!
L102085 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you fuckin' know!
L102060 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ C'mon!
L102059 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
L102058 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.
L102054 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ Aw, c'mon. I gotta clear my family name here. I've brought shame to the house of Della Rocco.
L102053 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
L102052 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ Oh man. You gotta let me do these guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make up for the tit thing.
L102049 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
L102048 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ What? What is it?
L102044 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ I-I'll tip her.
L102043 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ What the fuck are you doing?
L102025 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!
L102024 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.
L102021 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?
L102020 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Yeah, well...
L102013 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
L102012 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Anybody see ya?
L101983 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!
L101982 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview.
L101970 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em all!!
L101969 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ What happened?
L101968 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!
L101903 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ No, look. No rolling. Nothing needs to be rolled.
L101902 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
L101901 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
L101900 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
L101899 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
L101898 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
L101897 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ You think they sold me out? No way.
L101896 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
L101895 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ What are you saying?
L101894 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
L101893 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ What?
L101892 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
L101891 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
L101890 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ You sound real remorseful.
L101889 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
L101888 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Donna's gonna be angry about her cat.
L101885 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.
L101884 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.
L101869 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.
L101868 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
L101867 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Yes.
L101866 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ Anybody you think is evil?
L101862 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Get a hold of yourself, man.
L101861 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!
L101860 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
L101859 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!
L101856 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Let's do him right here.
L101855 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?
L101852 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ This is a six-shooter.
L101851 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ Chest pocket.  Shit!
L101850 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Where's your gun?
L101849 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!
L101581 +++$+++ u591 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ All right, I suppose you have the right ta know.
L101580 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
L101579 +++$+++ u591 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Still bickerin' over that, huh?
L101576 +++$+++ u591 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.
L101575 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Yeah, we promise.
L101568 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Well, I didn't but...
L101567 +++$+++ u591 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
L101566 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
L101555 +++$+++ u591 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.
L101554 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ How's Uncle Sibeal?
L101543 +++$+++ u591 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ BLAME...
L101542 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ No ma! No!
L101539 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it woman?! Now just calm down here.
L101538 +++$+++ u591 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
L101537 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ What?! What are you doin'?
L101534 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
L101533 +++$+++ u591 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.
L101531 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here.
L101530 +++$+++ u591 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got nothin' ta live for.
L101527 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Ma, what's wrong?
L101526 +++$+++ u591 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
L101525 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Mother, is that you?
L101524 +++$+++ u591 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Connor, is that you?
L101523 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Hello.
L102212 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ I'll call you tonight, afterwards. 
L102211 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Be careful.
L102210 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
L102209 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
L102208 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
L102207 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
L102206 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.
L101722 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Our mother can see through bags.
L101721 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front.
L101707 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Know any other languages?
L101706 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ We paid attention in school.
L101705 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?
L101668 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ They had some pretty interesting bandages. Know anything about that?
L101667 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ We... met them last night.
L101666 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?
L101672 +++$+++ u586 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ Ass!
L101671 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ me up the...
L101670 +++$+++ u586 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ Fuck!
L101669 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Would someone please come over here and...
L101646 +++$+++ u586 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ Right.
L101645 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.
L101640 +++$+++ u586 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ y-y-yeah that's what he said.
L101639 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
L101638 +++$+++ u586 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L101636 +++$+++ u586 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He left me his c-c, he left me his c-c, he left me this.
L101635 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ We're alive.
L102270 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ And we will send you to whatever God you wish.
L102269 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
L102268 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.
L102267 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost. 
L102266 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
L102265 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
L102264 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ With every breath we shall hunt them down.
L102263 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
L102262 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ It is your corrupt we claim.
L102261 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ We do not want your tired and sick.
L102260 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
L102259 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Now, you will receive us.
L102137 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ He's a good man.
L102136 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ He isn't to be touched.
L102131 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ And he is one smart man.
L102130 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ That's the guy that got us off the hook with the "Checkov" thing.
L102093 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ A-fuckin'-men!
L102092 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?
L102056 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.
L102055 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Give the guy a shot.
L102046 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
L102045 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ We've teamed up with a sex offender.
L102027 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ I'm strangely comfortable with it.
L102026 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ So what do you think?
L101976 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Holy shit. Who? How many?
L101975 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Who did you kill?
L101906 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Then what the fuck?
L101905 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Yes.
L101904 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?
L101872 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Kill em all. Admit it, even you've thought about it.
L101871 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.
L101870 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day.
L101854 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?
L101853 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Nine bodies.
L101847 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Yes, we are.
L101846 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Oh, we're good man.
L101845 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
L101844 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
L101843 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Aye.
L101842 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ That was way easier than I thought.
L101838 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Sh, sh! Fuck you!
L101837 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
L101836 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
L101835 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ No, fuck you. This rope is bullshit. I'm sweatin' my ass off draggin' this stupid thing around. Must weigh 30 pounds.
L101834 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ We'll find it. Just calm down.
L101833 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Where the fuck are you going?
L101832 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Just like on TV.
L101831 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
L101829 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Me, too.
L101828 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ A bit.
