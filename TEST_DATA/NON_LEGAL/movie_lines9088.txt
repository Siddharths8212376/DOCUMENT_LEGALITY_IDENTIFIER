L236605 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ A what?
L236717 +++$+++ u1099 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOHN ELLIS +++$+++ Get a job!
L236716 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Go die, asshole!
L236715 +++$+++ u1099 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOHN ELLIS +++$+++ I'm so sorry if you were offended!
L236714 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ That tape sucked, by the way!
L236713 +++$+++ u1099 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOHN ELLIS +++$+++ Oh, how "punk."
L236712 +++$+++ u1099 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOHN ELLIS +++$+++ Yeah yeah yeah. Do you have my money?
L236711 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ That's not even --
L236710 +++$+++ u1099 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOHN ELLIS +++$+++ If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
L236709 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I know it's over, asshole, I --
L236708 +++$+++ u1099 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOHN ELLIS +++$+++ Punk rock is over!
L236707 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Tell me what?
L236706 +++$+++ u1099 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOHN ELLIS +++$+++ Didn't they tell you?
L236689 +++$+++ u1101 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ You don't know what you're talking about.
L236688 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street.
L236687 +++$+++ u1101 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Yes.
L236686 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ ...are you waiting for a bus?
L236685 +++$+++ u1101 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Norman.
L236684 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Hi... what's your name?
L236415 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Later, "Dude".
L236414 +++$+++ u1098 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Hey, where are you going?
L236413 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.
L236409 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!
L236408 +++$+++ u1098 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
L236407 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I did too!
L236406 +++$+++ u1098 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.
L236405 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Did you bring that tape?
L236404 +++$+++ u1098 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Fine, and how are you?
L236403 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ You're late, asshole.
L236402 +++$+++ u1098 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.
L237099 +++$+++ u1096 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ God, fuck you!
L237098 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
L237097 +++$+++ u1096 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ Well why do I care about that?
L237096 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
L237095 +++$+++ u1096 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
L237094 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Five hundred.
L237093 +++$+++ u1096 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ What?
L237092 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ That's five hundred dollars.
L237462 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I can treat him any way I want to - I'm an adult! Leave me alone!
L237461 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I really want to talk to you. I've been thinking about what you said about moving in here...
L237439 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Shhh... I really need to get some sleep.
L237438 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ But, I...
L237437 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...
L237436 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
L237435 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Yeah, well... me neither...
L237434 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
L237433 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ No... forget it...
L237432 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I will if you want to.
L237431 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
L237430 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ ...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
L237429 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ God, Dana's going to kill you!
L237428 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What's the matter with you, Seymour? Don't you like me? Be a man for once in your life!
L237427 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I-I-I...
L237426 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What do you want?
L237425 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ What do you want?
L237424 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
L237423 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I dunno, I...
L237422 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
L237421 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ So where would we go?
L237420 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
L237419 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
L237418 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
L237417 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
L237416 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
L237415 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
L237414 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
L237413 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ What?
L237412 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ You know what my number one fantasy used to be?
L237411 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Yeah, well I like you too...
L237410 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
L237409 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ What about Joe?
L237408 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ ...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
L237407 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Yeah, sure. Of course.
L237406 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
L237405 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
L237404 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
L237403 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
L237402 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
L237401 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I hate sports.
L237400 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
L237399 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I'm just being realistic.
L237398 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
L237397 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
L237396 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
L237395 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
L237394 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Jesus, how can you stand her?
L237393 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
L237392 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Where did you get this?
L237391 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
L237390 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.
L237389 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
L237388 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not --
L237387 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What about this?
L237386 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Uh... I think there's some root beer...
L237385 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Do you have anything to drink?
L237384 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ What's the matter?
L237383 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
L237382 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Uh... sure... come in.
L237381 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Can you at least let me in?
L237380 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ What's up?
L237379 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I had to see you.
L237378 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L237334 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.
L237333 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ ...What do you mean?
L237332 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
L237331 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
L237330 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ In whatever way you think I mean.
L237329 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ In what way do you mean?
L237328 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ So, do you like me, Seymour?
L237327 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ No, of course not.
L237326 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Does that mean you don't like me?
L237325 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I... I don't think so.
L237324 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ You must have done something to make her think you like me.
L237323 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Just someone so young...
L237322 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
L237321 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
L237320 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
L237319 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
L237318 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
L237317 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
L237316 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ And you like them?
L237315 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Oh, uh... they were a present from Dana.
L237312 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know...
L237311 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Well when can we do something?
L237310 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --
L237309 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
L237308 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ ...I better not...
L237307 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
L237306 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
L237305 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
L237282 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, of course. I'm weighing several offers at the present time...
L237281 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ ...so... is he your boyfriend now?
L237280 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
L237279 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
L237278 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
L237277 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --
L237276 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What, are you trying to get rid of me?
L237275 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
L237274 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Sounds good...
L237273 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
L237272 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
L237271 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
L237270 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
L237269 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
L237268 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
L237267 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Really?
L237266 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
L237265 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ YAAA!
L237264 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Boo!
L237217 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Jesus, Enid... I'll talk to you later... bye!
L237216 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
L237215 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
L237214 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What? You're kidding me...
L237213 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...
L237212 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ So, what happened?
L237211 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Oh, hi...
L237210 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Hi, it's me...
L237209 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Uh... hello?
L237148 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Well, uh... I'm an expert-about stuff like this -- she was totally for real!
L237147 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ How can you be so sure?
L237146 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
L237145 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.
L237144 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?
L237143 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
L237142 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Wow!  What was that all about?
L237139 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...
L237138 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Aren't you going to get that?
L237137 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Who knows?
L237136 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?
L237135 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I won't even dignify that with a response.
L237134 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
L237133 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Why?
L237132 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
L237131 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Oh yeah?
L237130 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
L237129 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.
L237128 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away.
L237127 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything.
L237126 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Never...
L237125 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Really?
L237124 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
L237123 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ That's the spirit!
L237122 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
L237121 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
L237120 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What, like a girdle?
L237119 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
L237118 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What is that?
L237117 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ It's just my stupid back. I'll be all right in a minute...
L237116 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Are you okay?
L237115 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
L237114 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ No, Doofus... blow it out!
L237113 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...
L237112 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ You can open your eyes now.
L237030 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Don't you trust me, Seymour?
L237029 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
L237028 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I promise I'll take good care of it.
L237027 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ What? Why?
L237026 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Hey, can I borrow this?
L237025 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
L237024 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?
