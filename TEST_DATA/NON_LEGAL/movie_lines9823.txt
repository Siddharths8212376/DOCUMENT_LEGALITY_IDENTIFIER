L218072 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ The nails!! Watch the nails!!...  Listen, you still have to eat.
L218071 +++$+++ u5312 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Oh, no..I have to get home...
L218057 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Yeah!
L218056 +++$+++ u5312 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Really?
L218055 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch.
L218054 +++$+++ u5312 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I'm paying you.
L218053 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
L218052 +++$+++ u5312 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
L218051 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ I don't understand you. What is the problem?
L218050 +++$+++ u5312 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I think some people are meant to be alone.  Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts... 
L218049 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
L218048 +++$+++ u5312 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ ...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out.
L218039 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ It's a disgusting process. You haven't missed anything.
L218038 +++$+++ u5312 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I never really...went through a... dating period.
L218037 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
L218036 +++$+++ u5312 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Meeting ... people.
L218035 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ What?
L218034 +++$+++ u5312 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
L218033 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Fine.
L218032 +++$+++ u5312 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Well, there's nobody special!
L218031 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
L218030 +++$+++ u5312 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Do I look like I have someone special?
L218029 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ ...SO...anybody special in your life?
L218028 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ It's an awful thing, let me tell you. My Aunt used to say,  "divorce is the sister-in-law of death".
L218027 +++$+++ u5312 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ My parents were divorced.
L218026 +++$+++ u5312 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ You threw him out?
L218025 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ ...So he says to me, "you'll never find another man like me"...I said, "please, men like you have one hand on their dicks and the other hand on their mother's leg... I said, there's the door - take a trip.
L218024 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?
L218023 +++$+++ u5312 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Will it hurt?
L218022 +++$+++ u5312 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ No, thank you.
L218021 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
L218020 +++$+++ u5312 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I've never been in an apartment above a store.  You always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them.
L217986 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Ah... I do them myself.  I used to work in a beauty parlor.
L217985 +++$+++ u5312 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I like your nails.  Where did you get them done?
L217983 +++$+++ u5312 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Well, I guess I'll come back then.
L217982 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Yes!  They'll be in soon.
L217981 +++$+++ u5312 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Well did you or didn't you?
L217980 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day.
L217963 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Yeah.
L217962 +++$+++ u5312 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ But now it's free, right?
L217961 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ This will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.
L218095 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Huh...the restaurant's just around the corner here...
L218094 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ Yep! Right on it!
L218013 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ <u>What are you, out of your mind</u>!
L218012 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ Holdin' my penis... What a lovely way of sayin' how Much ya like me...
L218009 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ Why this is outrageous!...
L218008 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Most men are.
L218007 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
L218006 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ <u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?
L218002 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Jack, he's starting a conversation...
L218001 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
L218000 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
L217995 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ Got any more bread crust?
L217994 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and <u>him</u>... She didn't even look at him.
L218263 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!
L218262 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I think.. I...I realized...I love you.
L218258 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Terrific. Going on alot of dates ... seeing lots of men... lots of dates..
L218257 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ How have you been?
L218256 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Well!  What do you want me to do - applaud?
L218191 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Then what do you want to stay with me for?
L218190 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
L218189 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ <u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
L218188 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ What have you been doing here!  <u>Huh</u>! <u>I wanna know</u>!  <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!
L218187 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ All right... I'll pack my stuff tonight.
L218186 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
L218185 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
L218184 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ You can't even give me that?!  What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life...  ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else?  What were you planning to do, Jack?
L218181 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ No.  So what time do you need?  I love you -- you love me -- you want to get your career going, great!  I'd like to be a part of it -- I think I deserve that!  So what do you need to figure out alone!?
L218180 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No.
L218179 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
L218178 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ ... I'd like to focus on my career - - now than I can, now that everything's all right... Parry's taken care of... and... Like I said, I feel like I know a lot more now and I don't...
L218175 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Right now, I'm just not sure about... making such definite plans.
L218174 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
L218173 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ ... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little.
L218172 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No... it's just...
L218171 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
L218170 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No, I... I think we should talk about this.
L218169 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ "I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
L218168 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What?
L218166 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No, it's not... Come here...
L218165 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ ... What?... You don't want to commute?
L218164 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ ... I would love to start looking at least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...
L218163 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Ugh, these tapes are a mess.  I don't know where to begin...
L218161 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Ya know, I'm thinkin' -- with another income coming in, I would love to get a bigger place.
L218160 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Thanks.
L218159 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ It's so great to see you like this, honey... I can't tell you.
L218158 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ <u>You</u> made coffee?... You're going back to work <u>and</u> you made coffee?... I love this!
L218157 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I've got to put these tapes in some kind of order... and... Oh, I should get my sports jacket cleaned...  ... There's coffee if you want...
L218156 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ <u>Whoah</u>!  Oh, honey, that's terrific!
L218155 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ He says if I want to get back to work, no problem.  He wants me to come in and talk and... and... <u>that's</u> <u>it</u>!
L218154 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ You're kidding!  What did he say?
L218153 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ My agent.  I called my agent.
L218152 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ So what's going on?  Who's Lou again?
L218112 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You were great. Thanks alot.
L218111 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
L218110 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
L218109 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".
L218108 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You know, I can't believe I did it. You think it'll work out?
L218103 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ I think they're made for each other. And it scares me.
L218102 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What do you think?
L218070 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well..everything's closed up. We thought we'd get some dinner.  Say!....Anybody up for Chinese?  Have you eaten? Would you like to come along?
L218069 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ What are you two up to?
L218004 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Thank you very much.
L218003 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well talk back.  He won't bite you.
L217998 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ He just needs some clothes?
L217997 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ I don't know... He's a little disgusting... Although some women go for that.
L217954 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....
L217953 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Hello....congratulations.
L217915 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I thought... if... if I can help him in some way... you know?... get him this girl he loves... Then... maybe.... things'll start changing for me... My luck, ya know... Maybe...  Forget it... It's a stupid idea.
L217914 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Well, what the hell does that mean?
L217913 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ See, I told you!
L217912 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ What does that mean?
L217911 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
L217910 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
L217909 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I... You're not going to understand this.
L217908 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
L217907 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...
L217906 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ And who's Lydia?
L217905 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ He's not a moron.
L217904 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ The moron?
L217903 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I was not with a woman last night.  I was out with Parry.
L217902 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ ...<u>Forget it</u>... <u>Goodbye</u>!
L217901 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ ... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!
L217900 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
L217899 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
L217898 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
L217897 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
L217896 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
L217895 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Can I have my desk please.
L217717 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I wish there was some way I could... just... pay the fine and go home.
L217716 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ You didn't kill anybody.  Stop.
L217715 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit.  Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
L217714 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
L217713 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I tell you something, Anne.  I really feel like I'm cursed.
L217708 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...
L217707 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ ... You have a little... uh... something on your face...
L217706 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Oh sure... Gotta believe in God.  But I don't think God made man in his own image.  No.  'Cause most of... the bullshit that happens, is because of men.  No, I think man was made out of the devil's image and women were created out of God -- because women can have babies which is sorta like creating, and which also explains why women are attracted to men, because, lets face it, the devil is a helluva lot more interesting -- I slept with a few saints and let me tell you... <u>Booooorring</u>!!!... And so the whole point of life, I think, is for men and women to get married so the devil and God can live together and, ya know -- work it out...  ... Not that we have to get married.
L217705 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You still believe in God?
L217704 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
L217700 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Okay.  ... I love you...
L217699 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm not seeing anyone else.  I really was attacked.
L217698 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Please... before you go on... let me tawk... okay... We've had a wonderful time together... When we first met, you said this wasn't serious and I shouldn't get serious and then you moved in and we haven't been serious. And I just wanna say that I have no regrets.  None.  And don't wanna have any now so I want ya to be up front with me... I want the truth. If you're seein' somebody else, let me know... You don't have to pour gasoline on yourself and light a match just to break up with me.  Just tell me the truth.
L217697 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --
L217696 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ ... So... where did you sleep last night?
L217695 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ You're all right... you sure...
L217694 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No, I'm fine... really...
L217693 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ You were attacked.  My God.  Should I call a doctor!  Did you call the police...
L217689 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ <u>Oh my God</u>... <u>What did they do</u>!  <u>My</u> <u>God</u>!!!
L217688 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Two kids tried to set me on fire.
L217687 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ <u>What</u>!
L217686 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I was attacked.
L217685 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ I can't tell you how distraught I was.  All night long.  What the hell happened?
L217684 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ I smell gas... Do you smell gas...
L217683 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L217528 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.
L217527 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ It happens to be a beautiful love story.  Ya know, you used to like that about me.  You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much.  That we could be together and not think...
L217523 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.
L217522 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
L217521 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
L217520 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from me?
L217518 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Why don't you go upstairs... take the day off. All right?...I'll cook tonight.
L217517 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
L217516 +++$+++ u5305 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
L218202 +++$+++ u5306 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.
L218201 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What if I was a relative?
L218200 +++$+++ u5306 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Well, it's not unusual in his case... Sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain's replay system. The brain never loses anything - it just stores it up and waits. A person could actually re-experience the full effect of a tragedy, long after the event took place. Are you relatives?  Well, it doesn't matter. We'll take care of it. He'll have to be sent back to the same institution.. 
L218199 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ But..How could that happen?
L218198 +++$+++ u5306 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
L218197 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
L218196 +++$+++ u5306 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ He can't hear you.  Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub....  I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand...  ..."catatonic  stupor"...condition  rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...
