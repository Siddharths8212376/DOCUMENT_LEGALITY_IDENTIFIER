L29175 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
L29174 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
L29173 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --Bradlee went to Harvard--
L29172 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
L29171 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
L29170 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
L29169 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
L29168 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --it was bullshit the way it was--
L29167 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --it was fine the way it was--
L29166 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
L29165 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ What the hell were you doing rewriting my story--
L29647 +++$+++ u3626 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Oh.
L29646 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Night.
L29645 +++$+++ u3626 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Morning or night?
L29644 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ 11:30.
L29643 +++$+++ u3626 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ --what time is it?
L29642 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
L29641 +++$+++ u3626 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ --all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
L29640 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--
L29639 +++$+++ u3626 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ --jeeeeeeeeesus--
L29638 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --almost a year before he left the Justice Department--
L29637 +++$+++ u3626 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ --jeeeeeeesus--
L29636 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971--
L29635 +++$+++ u3626 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ --jeeeeeeesus--
L29634 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--
L29633 +++$+++ u3626 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ --jeeeeeeesus--
L29632 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--
L29631 +++$+++ u3626 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ What does it say?
L29356 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ This?  Naw...
L29355 +++$+++ u3617 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DARDIS +++$+++ I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was.  Think it might be anything?
L29352 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --yeah, that was in The Times this morning.
L29351 +++$+++ u3617 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DARDIS +++$+++ The rest is Barker's bank records. It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks--
L29350 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ The telephone calls... we know about that.
L29349 +++$+++ u3617 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DARDIS +++$+++ I'll never get out of here in time.
L29348 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Whatever.
L29347 +++$+++ u3617 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DARDIS +++$+++ You want Barker's phone stuff or his money stuff?
L29346 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ I'm on deadline.
L29345 +++$+++ u3617 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DARDIS +++$+++ Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
L29344 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Look, you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so.
L29338 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Good. Just tell him I was here, that I'm sorry I missed him--
L29337 +++$+++ u3630 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Well of course.
L29336 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Mr. Dardis does call in every so often?
L29334 +++$+++ u3630 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ He is not in the car.  Sorry.
L29333 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio?
L29331 +++$+++ u3630 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ I told you, he had to go out on a case.
L29330 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.
L29329 +++$+++ u3630 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ And you will.  But not now.
L29328 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
L29327 +++$+++ u3630 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ I'm so glad.
L29326 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Hi, it's me. I'm still here.
L29213 +++$+++ u3630 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Sure. I remember seeing a book about Chappaquiddick on his desk and he was always getting material out of the White House Library and the Library of Congress and--
L29212 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --Teddy Kennedy?
L29211 +++$+++ u3630 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
L29210 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Any idea what he did?
L29209 +++$+++ u3630 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.
L29208 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --Howard Hunt?
L29207 +++$+++ u3630 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Sorry.  Now if it was Hunt you were interested in--
L29752 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.  Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?
L29751 +++$+++ u3631 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SEGRETTI +++$+++ Can't help you.
L29750 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
L29749 +++$+++ u3631 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SEGRETTI +++$+++ I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
L29748 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ On the orders of Haldeman?
L29747 +++$+++ u3631 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SEGRETTI +++$+++ Sure--off the record.
L29746 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Chapin did contact you then?
L29745 +++$+++ u3631 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SEGRETTI +++$+++ None of it was my idea, Carl--I didn't go looking for the job.
L29744 +++$+++ u3631 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SEGRETTI +++$+++ When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know.  I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful?
L29743 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ But you know who did.
L29742 +++$+++ u3631 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SEGRETTI +++$+++ I didn't.
L29741 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
L29740 +++$+++ u3631 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SEGRETTI +++$+++ Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
L29739 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
L29738 +++$+++ u3631 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SEGRETTI +++$+++ Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
L29737 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Tell that to Muskie.
L29736 +++$+++ u3631 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SEGRETTI +++$+++ I didn't do anything wrong.
L29735 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Do you feel much about the things you did?
L29734 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ When did he hire you?
L29733 +++$+++ u3631 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SEGRETTI +++$+++ I know where Dwight works.
L29732 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ By "they" you mean the White House, don't you?  Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin-- he works for the White House.
L29731 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ By "they" you mean...?
L29730 +++$+++ u3631 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SEGRETTI +++$+++ They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
L29729 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
L29728 +++$+++ u3631 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SEGRETTI +++$+++ I've got a lot of energy.
L29727 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ According to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy.
L29726 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Mind if I try?
L29725 +++$+++ u3631 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SEGRETTI +++$+++ You can't.
L29724 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ I'm Carl Bernstein.  My paper sent me out to see if I couldn't persuade you to go on the record.
L29723 +++$+++ u3631 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SEGRETTI +++$+++ That's right.
L29722 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Donald Segretti?
L29830 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ And?--
L29829 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --he was going to go into law practice with Segretti.
L29826 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ We've just been talking to Young--
L29825 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ Speak.
L29613 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --yes--
L29612 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ --you got more than one source?--
L29301 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ You're the fella who forgot he rented a Hertz car, do I have to tell you they didn't forget to send us the bill?
L29300 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Down to Miami and back--how much damage can I do?
L29299 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ --"I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Toronto." That was your spiel then. "The Lifestyles of Deserters."  I'm still waiting for it.
L29298 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --that was awhile ago--
L29297 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--
L29296 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Miami.
L29295 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ --so?
L29294 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Harry, I just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker--
L29901 +++$+++ u3613 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BRADLEE +++$+++ --what about you?--
L29900 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Absolutely--
L29899 +++$+++ u3613 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BRADLEE +++$+++ --Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
L29819 +++$+++ u3613 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BRADLEE +++$+++ I could care less about where it happened; what happened is what counts.  Put him on.  Ken, I'm sorry, it was Goddamn Beirut and they were having a crisis, what's up, kid?  Slow down, Ken, you sound frazzled.  A wife and a family and a cat and a dog, right, Ken.  Ken, I would never print that you were in Marilyn's apartment at night-- unless, of course, you force me to.
L29818 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --if he did it or just said he did it, God knows.
L29693 +++$+++ u3613 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BRADLEE +++$+++ --it makes the break-in real--it's a major goddamn story--  --I'm not going to kick ass over this, but I'd like you to know I hate getting beat, I just hate it-- don't forget that I hate it--
L29692 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --there's nothing new in it--
L29691 +++$+++ u3613 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BRADLEE +++$+++ --it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this--
L29687 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --what?--
L29686 +++$+++ u3613 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BRADLEE +++$+++ I thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story--  --you think I like being aced out?
L29657 +++$+++ u3613 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BRADLEE +++$+++ If they ever start calling us goddamn liars--  --it's time to start circling the wagons.
L29656 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ What's a real denial?
L29623 +++$+++ u3613 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BRADLEE +++$+++ --Deep Throat?--
L29622 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --and we got a guy in Justice--
L29619 +++$+++ u3613 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BRADLEE +++$+++ --goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story--
L29618 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --no--
L29324 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Nobody's perfect.  I'm glad you're out of it, Hannah-- you're a terrific reporter and I turned you into a bookkeeper.
L29323 +++$+++ u3620 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?
L29322 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ There's always a later plane.
L29321 +++$+++ u3620 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ I thought you had to get to Miami.
L29320 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ It's right under that pile.
L29319 +++$+++ u3620 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Give me your checkbook then.
L29318 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ I think.
L29317 +++$+++ u3620 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?
L29316 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Five hundred; six maybe.
L29315 +++$+++ u3620 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
L29314 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Hey... very tense.
L29313 +++$+++ u3620 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Carl, it's a jungle.  I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles.  You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for.
L29312 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See? 
L29311 +++$+++ u3620 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Where are your bills, Carl?
L29310 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast.
L29414 +++$+++ u3623 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ We're a long way from high school, Carl...  ...and I'm scared.
L29413 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Hey, easy...
L29412 +++$+++ u3623 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I don't know what they'd do to me.
L29411 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
L29410 +++$+++ u3623 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
L29409 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ FBI too?
L29408 +++$+++ u3623 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.
L29407 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --you don't really think you're being followed?
L29406 +++$+++ u3623 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Anyplace really public, they'd know about it--they know everything at the Committee, Carl--
L29405 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ This is practically a high school reunion for us, Jane--I would have sprung for a classier place.
L29537 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Think Sloan's being set up as a fall guy for John Mitchell? Sometimes it looks that way.
L29536 +++$+++ u3612 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BOOKKEEPER +++$+++ It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
L29535 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Gordon Liddy, you mean?
L29534 +++$+++ u3612 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BOOKKEEPER +++$+++ --omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
L29533 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ It's awfully hot--  --and you haven't finished telling me about the money--
L29530 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Sloan knew which five, didn't he? 
L29529 +++$+++ u3612 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BOOKKEEPER +++$+++ There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
L29528 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Who were they?
L29527 +++$+++ u3612 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BOOKKEEPER +++$+++ The ones who could disburse the money.
L29526 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Which people?
L29525 +++$+++ u3612 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BOOKKEEPER +++$+++ I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
L29524 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
L29523 +++$+++ u3612 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BOOKKEEPER +++$+++ A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
L29522 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
L29521 +++$+++ u3612 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BOOKKEEPER +++$+++ There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--
L29515 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ It's obvious you want to talk to someone--well, I'm someone.
L29514 +++$+++ u3612 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BOOKKEEPER +++$+++ ...No... never in so many words...
L29513 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ I was just curious--you don't do it well, so I wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it?
L29512 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --right, right, I've got to go.  Why did you lie just then?
L29511 +++$+++ u3612 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BOOKKEEPER +++$+++ One minute but then--
L29508 +++$+++ u3612 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BOOKKEEPER +++$+++ I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
L29507 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse?
L29506 +++$+++ u3612 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BOOKKEEPER +++$+++ I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
L29505 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
L29504 +++$+++ u3612 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BOOKKEEPER +++$+++ All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
L29503 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ But I want you to know that I understand why you're afraid--a lot of good people down there at the Committee are afraid. I'm really sorry for what you're being put through.
L29502 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Just let me get a match.
L29501 +++$+++ u3612 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BOOKKEEPER +++$+++ You've really got to go.
L29292 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Irwin? I really feel bad, doing something like this--you know that, don't you?
L29291 +++$+++ u3622 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ IRWIN +++$+++ A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
L29290 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Who by?
L29289 +++$+++ u3622 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ IRWIN +++$+++ It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
L29288 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Just tell me about the goddamn article.
L29287 +++$+++ u3622 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ IRWIN +++$+++ And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
L29286 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Something maybe big.
L29285 +++$+++ u3622 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ IRWIN +++$+++ My big civil rights buddy--  --boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming.  What're you onto?
L29284 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ No games, Irwin; give.
L29283 +++$+++ u3622 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ IRWIN +++$+++ What do you want to know?
L29282 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ So tell me about the Times article.
L29281 +++$+++ u3622 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ IRWIN +++$+++ 'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
L29280 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office, Irwin?
L29865 +++$+++ u3633 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ --let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
L29864 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--
L29861 +++$+++ u3633 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I'm not your source on that.
L29860 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --that leaves Haldeman, period.
L29857 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --it's gotta be Haldeman--someone from the White House had to be involved--
L29856 +++$+++ u3633 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ --I'm not your source on that--
L29849 +++$+++ u3633 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ --my wife just had the baby, my in- laws are arriving, I'm trying to get the house in some kind of shape.
L29848 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --this'll only take one second--
L29847 +++$+++ u3633 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I really can't talk now--
L29606 +++$+++ u3633 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ We're moving.  I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes I wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them.
L29605 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ What happens when the baby comes?
L29604 +++$+++ u3633 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the money."
L29603 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?
L29600 +++$+++ u3633 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to Liddy who gave it back to me and I put it in the office safe which was crammed.
L29599 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Right.
