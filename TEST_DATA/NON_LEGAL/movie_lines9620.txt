L96097 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.
L96096 +++$+++ u4139 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KRISTINA +++$+++ Shhhh.
L96095 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I fucked up.
L96094 +++$+++ u4139 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KRISTINA +++$+++ I know, Dad.  I know...
L96093 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I didn't mean to...
L96092 +++$+++ u4139 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KRISTINA +++$+++ It's alright, Dad.
L96091 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.
L95981 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I swear on your life.
L95980 +++$+++ u4139 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KRISTINA +++$+++ Swear on my life.
L95979 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I swear.  On my life.
L95978 +++$+++ u4139 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KRISTINA +++$+++ I don't believe you.
L95977 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.
L95976 +++$+++ u4139 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KRISTINA +++$+++ You swear?
L95975 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ There's schools in California.
L95974 +++$+++ u4139 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KRISTINA +++$+++ But I've got school.
L95973 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
L95972 +++$+++ u4139 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KRISTINA +++$+++ You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
L95971 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see what it's like.  I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday.  Thursday after school.
L95970 +++$+++ u4139 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KRISTINA +++$+++ You swear?
L95969 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't know.  Maybe California.
L95968 +++$+++ u4139 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KRISTINA +++$+++ Where are you going?
L95967 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm thinking about getting out of town this week.  You want to come with me?
L95945 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'll be here.
L95944 +++$+++ u4139 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KRISTINA +++$+++ Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?
L95942 +++$+++ u4139 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KRISTINA +++$+++ California.
L95941 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ California, huh?
L95940 +++$+++ u4139 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KRISTINA +++$+++ No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
L95939 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
L95938 +++$+++ u4139 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KRISTINA +++$+++ Yeah.
L95937 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ California?  You can go anywhere in the world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia. Paris.  And you choose California?
L95935 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah, sure, whatever.
L95934 +++$+++ u4139 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KRISTINA +++$+++ You mean, like a trip?
L95933 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Let me ask you something.  If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go?
L95917 +++$+++ u4139 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KRISTINA +++$+++ Do what you want, it's a free country.
L95916 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
L95915 +++$+++ u4139 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KRISTINA +++$+++ What do you want from me?
L95914 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.  I'm going to make this right.  I've got a few things going on...
L95913 +++$+++ u4139 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KRISTINA +++$+++ I don't want, alright?  It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew it, now leave me alone.
L95912 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You can call me Dad if you want.
L95911 +++$+++ u4139 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KRISTINA +++$+++ What?
L95910 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Dad.
L95909 +++$+++ u4139 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KRISTINA +++$+++ George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
L95908 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ How are you doing?
L95907 +++$+++ u4139 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KRISTINA +++$+++ Well, here I am.  See?
L95906 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
L95905 +++$+++ u4139 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KRISTINA +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L95889 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ No, never.  Don't even think about that, it's impossible.  I love your mother. And you are my heart.  Could I live without my heart?  Could I?
L95888 +++$+++ u4139 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KRISTINA +++$+++ Are we gonna split up?
L95887 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't know.
L95886 +++$+++ u4139 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KRISTINA +++$+++ What's happening to us?
L95885 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
L96106 +++$+++ u4137 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ We'll do that tomorrow, okay?  It's lockdown time.
L96105 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Because she's visiting me.
L96104 +++$+++ u4137 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Okay, George.
L96103 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  My daughter.
L96102 +++$+++ u4137 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Not today, George.  Time to go back.
L96101 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ But I have a visitor.
L96053 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...
L96052 +++$+++ u4142 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ PROSECUTOR +++$+++ Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?
L96051 +++$+++ u4142 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ PROSECUTOR +++$+++ Let the record state the witness has identified, Diego Delgado.
L96050 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
L96049 +++$+++ u4142 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ PROSECUTOR +++$+++ Do you see him here in the courtroom?
L96048 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yes, I do.
L96047 +++$+++ u4142 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ PROSECUTOR +++$+++ Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?
L95986 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't give a shit.  Split it up.  Have a great life.  I'm done.  I'm out. Starting over.  Cheers.
L95985 +++$+++ u4140 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's an extra two-hundred large.
L95984 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone just got a raise.  Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen.
L95922 +++$+++ u4140 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ They're over at the booth.
L95921 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
L95920 +++$+++ u4140 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation.
L95919 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Who's the co-pilot?
L95918 +++$+++ u4140 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ It's a four-man operation.  Two on the ground.  Two in the air.
L95282 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Actually, I've got some news.  That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it.
L95281 +++$+++ u4143 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ SANTIAGO +++$+++ Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man of your word.
L95271 +++$+++ u4143 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ SANTIAGO +++$+++ Amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand dollars, and I have no more concerns.
L95270 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
L95269 +++$+++ u4143 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ SANTIAGO +++$+++ Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
L95268 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
L95267 +++$+++ u4143 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ SANTIAGO +++$+++ Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back.
L95266 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane.
L95265 +++$+++ u4143 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ SANTIAGO +++$+++ Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
L95264 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Very nice.  I'll take it.
L95263 +++$+++ u4143 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ SANTIAGO +++$+++ For instance, something like this?
L95262 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yes, I am.
L95261 +++$+++ u4143 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ SANTIAGO +++$+++ Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
L95983 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance.
L95982 +++$+++ u4138 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Are we good?
L95926 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ That was it.  Seeing Dulli after fourteen years sealed the deal for me. The rest was just details.  My end was roughly five-hundred thousand.  Kristina and I could have a good life for five hundred grand.  Start over somewhere. One final score.  That's all I needed.
L95925 +++$+++ u4138 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
L95924 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Holy shit, Dulli!
L95279 +++$+++ u4138 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
L95278 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Not that far, only halfway.  You sure you know what you're doing?
L95249 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Who speaks Spanish?
L95248 +++$+++ u4138 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we start?
L95245 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ So, we need to get to the source.
L95244 +++$+++ u4138 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ So?
L95241 +++$+++ u4138 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ What?
L95240 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It's not enough.
L95211 +++$+++ u4138 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ When there's something to move, it's too easy not to.  Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U. Mass, Amherst, B.U....
L95210 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah?
L95207 +++$+++ u4138 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?
L95206 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah?
L95205 +++$+++ u4138 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I wish there was shit like this back home.
L95204 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Stoned?
L95203 +++$+++ u4138 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
L95202 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Right on.
L95199 +++$+++ u4138 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ No, man.  I'm too fucked up.
L95198 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
L95197 +++$+++ u4138 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
L95196 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
L95195 +++$+++ u4138 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Well, I'll tell you.  I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy.  I didn't know you guys were living in California.
L95273 +++$+++ u4138 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Don't be such a pussy.
L95272 +++$+++ u4144 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ TUNA +++$+++ I can't believe we're stealing a plane.
L95251 +++$+++ u4138 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ You know, he's got a point.  We're fucking Americans.  We stick out like sore thumbs.
L95250 +++$+++ u4144 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ TUNA +++$+++ This is bullshit, George.  We're never going to find anything down there.
L95239 +++$+++ u4144 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ TUNA +++$+++ Cheer up, man.  Half this money is ours. We're fucking rich.
L95238 +++$+++ u4138 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ What's the matter, George?  Something wrong?  You look like you just fucked your mother.
L95237 +++$+++ u4144 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ TUNA +++$+++ Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just looking at it.
L95236 +++$+++ u4138 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
L95213 +++$+++ u4138 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Right.  And Holyoke.  There are a hundred thousand rich kids with their parents' money to spend, but there's never anything available.  Nothing good, anyway.  I'm paying four hundred dollars for shit.
L95212 +++$+++ u4144 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ TUNA +++$+++ Smith.  Hampshire....
L95209 +++$+++ u4138 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ That's right.
L95208 +++$+++ u4144 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ TUNA +++$+++ No shit, Kevin?
L95201 +++$+++ u4138 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Fuck yeah.  I never seen nothing like it.  I'm fucking wasted.
L95200 +++$+++ u4144 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ TUNA +++$+++ Nice weed, huh?
L99031 +++$+++ u4156 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ MATHIEU +++$+++ The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
L99030 +++$+++ u4145 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ 2ND JOURNALIST +++$+++ Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
L98958 +++$+++ u4156 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ MATHIEU +++$+++ The UN is far away, dear sir. It is easier to make oneself heard with bombs. If I were in their place, I would use bombs.
L98957 +++$+++ u4145 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ 2ND JOURNALIST +++$+++ They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.
L98956 +++$+++ u4156 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ MATHIEU +++$+++ And you believe the NLF?
L98955 +++$+++ u4145 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ 2ND JOURNALIST +++$+++ But the NLF has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ...
L98952 +++$+++ u4156 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ MATHIEU +++$+++ No. It has failed in its objective.
L98951 +++$+++ u4145 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ 2ND JOURNALIST +++$+++ The strike is a success; but ...
L98950 +++$+++ u4156 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ MATHIEU +++$+++ Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.
L99037 +++$+++ u4156 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ MATHIEU +++$+++ And those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win. Therefore, to be precise, I would now like to ask you a question: Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences.
L99036 +++$+++ u4146 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ 3RD JOURNALIST +++$+++ The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
L99035 +++$+++ u4156 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ MATHIEU +++$+++ Let's try to be precise then. The word "torture" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?
L99034 +++$+++ u4146 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ 3RD JOURNALIST +++$+++ The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
L99033 +++$+++ u4156 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ MATHIEU +++$+++ I understand. What's your question?
L99032 +++$+++ u4146 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ 3RD JOURNALIST +++$+++ Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions, to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. I think it would be better to call things by their right names; if one means torture, then one should call it torture.
L98966 +++$+++ u4156 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ MATHIEU +++$+++ It depends on you.
L98965 +++$+++ u4146 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ 3RD JOURNALIST +++$+++ And here?
L98964 +++$+++ u4156 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ MATHIEU +++$+++ In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.
L98963 +++$+++ u4156 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ MATHIEU +++$+++ Exactly.
L98962 +++$+++ u4146 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ 3RD JOURNALIST +++$+++ Dien Bien Phu?
L98961 +++$+++ u4156 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ MATHIEU +++$+++ It is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war; from terrorism, one passes to insurrection ... as from open guerrilla warfare one passes to real war, the latter being the determining factor ...

L98757 +++$+++ u4148 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ALI +++$+++ The NLF has condemned you to death.

L99014 +++$+++ u4155 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ KADER +++$+++ No. Not you, or any one of us. As long as we are free, the NLF continues to exist in the Casbah. If they manage to take us too, there won't be anything left ... And from nothing comes nothing ...
L99013 +++$+++ u4148 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ALI +++$+++ No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
L99012 +++$+++ u4155 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ KADER +++$+++ Of course. As soon as possible.
L99011 +++$+++ u4148 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ALI +++$+++ Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
L99010 +++$+++ u4155 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ KADER +++$+++ It's better to split up, to increase our chances. We must change hiding places, and change them continually ... In the meantime, we must make new contacts, replace our arrested brothers, reorganize our sections--
L98904 +++$+++ u4155 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ KADER +++$+++ No, it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people.
L98903 +++$+++ u4148 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ALI +++$+++ Why? Isn't he sleeping here?
L98733 +++$+++ u4155 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ KADER +++$+++ Not enough.
L98732 +++$+++ u4148 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ALI +++$+++ And how many are we?
L98731 +++$+++ u4155 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ KADER +++$+++ Because we aren't ready yet for the French. Before attacking, we must have safe places from which to depart and find refuge. Of course, there is the Casbah. But even the Casbah isn't safe yet. There are too many drunks, pushers, whores, addicts, spies ... people who talk too much ... people who are ready to sell themselves, undecided people. We must either convince them or eliminate them. We must think of ourselves first. We must clean out the Casbah first. Only then will we be able to deal with the French. Do you understand, Ali?
L98730 +++$+++ u4148 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ALI +++$+++ You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
L98729 +++$+++ u4155 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ KADER +++$+++ Then don't complain.
L98728 +++$+++ u4148 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ALI +++$+++ I don't do that kind of thing.
L98727 +++$+++ u4155 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ KADER +++$+++ C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
L98726 +++$+++ u4148 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ALI +++$+++ What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
L98725 +++$+++ u4155 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ KADER +++$+++ You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
L98724 +++$+++ u4148 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ALI +++$+++ But I haven't shot him.
L98723 +++$+++ u4155 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ KADER +++$+++ My name is Kader, Ali ... Saari Kader ... In other words, in order to join the organization, you had to undergo a test. I could have told you to murder the barman, but he's an Algerian ... and the police would let you kill him, even though he is one of theirs. By obeying such an order, you still could have been a double agent. And that's why I told you to kill the French policeman: because the French wouldn't have let you do it. If you were with the police you wouldn't have done it.
L98722 +++$+++ u4148 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ALI +++$+++ I don't even know your name yet ...
L98721 +++$+++ u4155 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ KADER +++$+++ Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
L98720 +++$+++ u4148 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ALI +++$+++ Sure. By shooting at me.
L98719 +++$+++ u4155 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ KADER +++$+++ Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ...
L98718 +++$+++ u4155 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ KADER +++$+++ I'll explain.
L98717 +++$+++ u4148 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ALI +++$+++ With an unloaded pistol?
L98829 +++$+++ u4148 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ALI +++$+++ Go away.
L98828 +++$+++ u4158 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ PETIT OMAR +++$+++ With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
L98827 +++$+++ u4148 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ALI +++$+++ Where's Kader?
L98699 +++$+++ u4158 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ PETIT OMAR +++$+++ Here?
L98698 +++$+++ u4148 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ALI +++$+++ Read it.
L98697 +++$+++ u4158 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ PETIT OMAR +++$+++ Sure ...
L98696 +++$+++ u4148 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ALI +++$+++ Can you read?
L98690 +++$+++ u4158 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ PETIT OMAR +++$+++ Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries ...
