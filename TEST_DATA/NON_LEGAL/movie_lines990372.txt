L560586 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
L560585 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ You think they're strange?
L560584 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
L560583 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Ask, You're the girl reporter.
L560582 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Oh.  Well, where do we start?
L560581 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
L560580 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Oh, I've got to get some matches.  My cigarette.
L560578 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Not exactly. He's kind of a rewrite man. Actually, he's a bit dull, if you know what I mean.
L560577 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
L560576 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
L560575 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
L560574 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Well...flashlight?
L560572 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
L560571 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
L560570 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
L560569 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
L560568 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ I came to talk to you.
L560567 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Wha'...what are you doing here?
L560566 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Right on the first guess.
L560565 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Superman???
L560564 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
L560563 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ With my luck, now it'll rain.
L560446 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
L560445 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Who...who...
L560444 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Not while I'm around you're not. C'mon...
L560443 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Oh, God! I'm going to die!
L560442 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Do as I say. Let go!
L560441 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ You've got me? Who's got you???
L560440 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Easy now, miss, I've got you???
L560714 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Good enough for you. Now then --  --  tell me something I like to hear. As many times as I hear it...
L560713 +++$+++ u8036 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Sort of.
L560704 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Ah, dear simple Otis. Albert explain it to him.
L560703 +++$+++ u8036 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ I still don't get it.
L560654 +++$+++ u8036 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Oh, Mr. Luthor...
L560653 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
L560652 +++$+++ u8036 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.
L560651 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ They're killing me by inches!  Go ahead! Make me suffer! Milk me dry.
L560650 +++$+++ u8036 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ It's a Twinkie, boss.
L560649 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.
L560643 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Will kill him! And I'm going to have a piece of the rock! Miss Teschmacher, pack your --
L560642 +++$+++ u8036 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --
L560641 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ But, to someone from the planet Krypton, this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity. Kryptonite! Ah, Kryptonite! That's the stuff!
L560506 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Y'know? I'm sure of it. Y'know? And there's a strong streak of goody- goody in him that is going to blow this deal for me if I don't do something about it.  Something!
L560505 +++$+++ u8036 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ It is for me.
L560504 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Is that real enough for you?
L560402 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Otis...
L560401 +++$+++ u8036 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Please...
L560387 +++$+++ u8036 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ I guess I...uh...regressed.
L560386 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again.  Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?
L560385 +++$+++ u8036 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ I...uh...check.
L560384 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ I gave him this new face.
L560383 +++$+++ u8036 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
L560382 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ I gave him steady employment --
L560381 +++$+++ u8036 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
L560380 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ I broke the man out of prison --
L560379 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Otis, were you up to your old tricks?
L560378 +++$+++ u8036 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
L560377 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ What's the matter, Otis?
L560376 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Excellent, Otis.  But what took you so long?
L560375 +++$+++ u8036 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
L560374 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
L560373 +++$+++ u8036 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ There.
L560372 +++$+++ u8036 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Yessir. Just what you wanted.
L560371 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
L560346 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ No speeches, Otis. Just watch what Albert has prepared.  What are you waiting for?
L560345 +++$+++ u8036 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ I...uh...
L560842 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ We'll see how fast I can fly.
L560841 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
L560838 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong.  But how could you know that -  Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it.
L560837 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.
L560833 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ In a way  -- oh, it'll be a relief. I'm a wreck. No rest for the wicked, y'know. It wasn't enough, the radio frequencies, then I had to worry about getting to the missile and adjusting the aiming. So that if I could have activated the launch  -- well, Lex Luthor would've hit the spot.  There's a little place on Route 190. Dead on the practice optimum stress point of the San Andreas Fault. It wouldn't mean much to you, Superman, but I call it...target zero.  Pancho's Taco Palace...
L560832 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ They'll soon be over.
L560831 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Well, that's their problem, T.S. But  --  but the XK 101 also works on a radio wave control system. The problem was to find out the frequency. Problems, problems, I've had so many...
L560830 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ You guessed it!  You're always one step ahead of me.  Aren't you Superman?  Yes, right. There was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors. The minute the signal went out --  Zip!  Zip!  Zip!
L560829 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Luthor  --
L560827 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ And garbage doors.
L560826 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ On radio waves?
L560825 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Still, foolishly, perhaps, I had a theory that eliminates the Presidential push-button.  I was doing my homework...
L560821 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
L560820 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
L560819 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
L560818 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have  --
L560817 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Maybe I should get help.
L560816 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.
L560815 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ --  Dropped into the sea!  Bye-bye California! Hello, new West Coast! Gold Coast! My Coast.  And now...well...  I left my heart in San Francisco...
L560814 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have  --
L560813 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Couldn't have said it better myself.  Now all this  --  --  west of the Fault is the most expensive real estate in the world. Los Angeles. San Diego. San Francisco. And here  --  --  is just hundreds and hundreds of miles of cheap desert land. Land that happens to be owned by Lex Luthor Enterprises. Well...  ...call me a fool, but ...it did occur to me that if a conventional five hundred megaton bomb were to explode at exactly the proper stress point --  --  that would trigger the upheaval that would cause the San Andreas Fault to 'do its thing.'  Ah, it would've been so nice, y'know...
L560812 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
L560811 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you've heard of it.
L560810 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Right, right. Where was I? Ah, yes --
L560809 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Of time, Luthor.
L560808 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ It's just that  --  I spent a fortune on these things!  And all for naught! What a waste  --
L560807 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ No, Superman, of course not. You do get around, don't you.
L560806 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.
L560805 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ This is California. The richest, most populous state in America. And growing like a sonofagun.
L560795 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Oh, that. Listen  --  you're busy  --  and it's a long story --
L560794 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
L560793 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Well  --  you've got me! What can I say?
L560672 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ But...why?
L560671 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
L560670 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ What is this??!
L565094 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I'll tell her that.
L565093 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ I hope she gets better.
L565092 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I will.
L565091 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ Say hi to Zoe.
L565090 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Alison.
L565089 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ Alison.
L565088 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.
L565087 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens.
L564735 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Nothing.  We made it to the hospital.  I didn't have to go as far as I was prepared to.  But I was prepared to go all the way.
L564734 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ What happened?
L564729 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I didn't know.  I was in a panic.  I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell.  Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital.  I finally got a doctor on the line.  He sounded young, but cool.  He was confident, but there was a nervousness.  He have been an intern.  This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was.
L564728 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ What happened?
L564727 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
L564726 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ I...don't think so.
L564617 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ That's okay.
L564616 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I'm...so sorry.
L564615 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ It turns to steaming piss.
L564614 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ What...does it turn to?
L564555 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Yes.  Do you find there's something strange about this meat?
L564554 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ She's in trouble?
L564553 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ That's where I'm going.  To see her.
L564552 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ But you said...
L564551 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ She didn't.
L564550 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ Then...when did she get better?
L564549 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Other clinics?  Oh sure.  Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...
L564548 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ So there were others?
L564547 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
L564546 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
L564545 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Which clinic?
L564544 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ Which one?
L564543 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Which one?
L564542 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.
L564541 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Are you still in touch?
L564540 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
L564495 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
L564494 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Yes...fine.
L564493 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ I'd heard that.  But she's well?
L564492 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ We're...not together.
L564491 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ How is Mrs. Stephens?
L564490 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Ally Jones.
L564489 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ He used to work with you.  Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife.
L564488 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ And what does he do again?
L564487 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
L564486 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?
L564485 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ How are you?
L564484 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Ally.  That's right.
L564483 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ Ally.  That was my nickname.
L564482 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Yes.
L564481 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Alison Jones.
L564480 +++$+++ u8039 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ALISON +++$+++ Yes, we do know each other.  I'm Alison Jones.
L564864 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I'm telling you this because we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel...
L564863 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Why are you telling me this?
L564862 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
L564771 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I'm telling you this because... we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel.
L564770 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Why are you telling me this?
L564769 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
L564767 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I know Risa and Wendell Walker. They wouldn't hire a goddamned lawyer.  And the Ottos wouldn't deal
L564766 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.
L564765 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Case?
L564764 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.
L564763 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.
L564762 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
L564761 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now?  Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month.  Because that's what I'm about to do.
L564759 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Not unless you can raise the dead.
L564758 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I can help you.
L564757 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ No you don't.
L564756 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I understand.
L564755 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Mister, I don't want to know your name.
L564754 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ My name is...
L564682 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Goodnight, Nicole.
L564681 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.
L564680 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Oh.  Right.
L564679 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I'm not sure.
L564678 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ What do you mean 'outgrown it'?
L564677 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ And she really liked you.  She would've given you all this if she'd outgrown it, or...
L564676 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.
L564675 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
L564674 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ I don't know.
L564673 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Why?
L564672 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ It just seems...kind of weird.
L564671 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Yeah.
L564670 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Are you sure?
L564623 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Okay.
L564622 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I'll be back around nine.
L564621 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Was it good?
L564620 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ They just finished supper.
L564619 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...
L564618 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Hi, Nicole.
L564995 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Say hello for me.
L564994 +++$+++ u8043 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ She's resting.  In her room.
L564993 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ How is Nicole?  Is she around?
L564992 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ The children.
L564991 +++$+++ u8043 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Billy, please.  The children.
L564990 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.
L564977 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen...
L564976 +++$+++ u8043 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.
L564989 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L564988 +++$+++ u8040 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. I'll even give you the money I got for my kids.  That's what we used to do, remember? Help each other.  This was a community.
L564987 +++$+++ u8049 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
