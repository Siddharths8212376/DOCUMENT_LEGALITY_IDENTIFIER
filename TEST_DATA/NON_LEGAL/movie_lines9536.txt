L38755 +++$+++ u3658 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
L38754 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ What?
L38753 +++$+++ u3658 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
L38752 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Psychic awareness. Right.
L38750 +++$+++ u3658 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ The cops. It's their backward laws that force all this underground in the first place, endangering people whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception, exploring new states of psychic awareness.
L38749 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
L38748 +++$+++ u3658 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.
L38746 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I know. I'm Andy McDermott. Terrence's nephew.
L38745 +++$+++ u3658 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ I'm sorry my friend, I'm not signing books right now. There's been a tragedy.
L39295 +++$+++ u3665 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ TERRENCE +++$+++ I never thought I'd ask this of anyone, Andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you?
L39294 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Claude.
L39293 +++$+++ u3665 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ TERRENCE +++$+++ Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.
L39292 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Uncle Terrence, you're...
L39132 +++$+++ u3665 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ TERRENCE +++$+++ AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
L39131 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Where is it! Please!
L39130 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?!
L39129 +++$+++ u3665 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ TERRENCE +++$+++ Oh shit! No! Andy, don't let them take me back there!
L39128 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I went to St. Severin church.  Now look -
L39127 +++$+++ u3665 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ TERRENCE +++$+++ The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
L39126 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
L39125 +++$+++ u3665 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ TERRENCE +++$+++ Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell.
L39124 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Sort of...
L39123 +++$+++ u3665 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ TERRENCE +++$+++ Andy, I have to tell you about the dream I had - or that I'm still having - it feels like a systemic, physio- tropic reaction to some drug, maybe a triptamine or phenethylamine derivative. But it is hyper-real. I'd swear my legs had been cut off or... wait a second... I'm getting a strange meta-physical buzz. Shit. I'm, uh, dead, aren't I?
L39122 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence -
L39121 +++$+++ u3665 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ TERRENCE +++$+++ Andy? Andy is that you?
L39120 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Uncle Terrence?
L39097 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower.  And what about you?
L39096 +++$+++ u3663 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Yeah, well I don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. Otherwise it's -
L39010 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Puking on yourself in midair is not a good death.
L39009 +++$+++ u3663 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
L39008 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Shit. I feel sick.
L38999 +++$+++ u3663 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.
L38998 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
L38990 +++$+++ u3663 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Good man. Now can I have my arms back?
L38989 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Alright. Let me write a letter.
L38981 +++$+++ u3663 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
L38980 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
L38958 +++$+++ u3663 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ What are you so damn angry about? Did somebody turn into a wild beast and rip your intestines out? Huh?
L38957 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
L38956 +++$+++ u3663 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ I'm afraid she's not so lucky. She's undead. And so am I.
L38695 +++$+++ u3663 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? Thanks for your help.
L38694 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Not that I know.
L38693 +++$+++ u3663 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
L38692 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Why would he pick this one?
L38691 +++$+++ u3663 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
L38690 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?
L38687 +++$+++ u3663 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Andy, it's not so easy. There are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels under Paris. It's a whole other city, crawling with drug addicts, lunatics, skinheads... It's no man's land.
L38686 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
L38685 +++$+++ u3663 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Maybe we should go now. You must be very tired. We'll call if any new -
L38684 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Yeah, well, these fleas must have teeth like fuckin' chain saws.
L38683 +++$+++ u3663 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
L38682 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ What do you mean, maniacs?
L38681 +++$+++ u3663 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
L38680 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
L38679 +++$+++ u3663 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
L38678 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
L38677 +++$+++ u3663 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ How well did, er, do you know him?
L38676 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Jesus...
L38672 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?
L38671 +++$+++ u3663 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ He's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my English is better.  This way... So you're from New York eh? I love those Hill Street Blues...
L38669 +++$+++ u3656 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ That's McDermott, but yeah.
L38668 +++$+++ u3663 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
L38968 +++$+++ u3657 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ CHIEF +++$+++ Are you crazy? We have nothing. Let him go, then watch him. If you're right, you can pick him up at midnight. Or maybe he'll lead you to the others. Just let him go.
L38967 +++$+++ u3662 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ LEDUC +++$+++ I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
L38966 +++$+++ u3657 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ CHIEF +++$+++ Enough. Cut him loose.
L38953 +++$+++ u3662 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ LEDUC +++$+++ I told you. These murders are not normal.
L38952 +++$+++ u3657 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ CHIEF +++$+++ Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
L38951 +++$+++ u3662 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ LEDUC +++$+++ I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
L38950 +++$+++ u3657 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ CHIEF +++$+++ Okay. So he's weird. Maybe on drugs. Still, that's not -
L39171 +++$+++ u3658 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Oh, did I hurt the little girl's feelings? Well excusez moi... I confess my desire for ADM is quite "intense". So I deceived you and our poor friend Terry - a competent technician, but let's face it, a bit naive. "The great cure for lycanthropy!" Hmph. He didn't have the vision to grasp the potential of ADAM, until it was too late. And even then, he came rushing down to tell me, as if I would be just as shocked! Ha.
L39170 +++$+++ u3664 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ SERAFINE +++$+++ You fucking liar!
L39169 +++$+++ u3658 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
L38877 +++$+++ u3658 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ God, well don't let him go! Catch him!
L38876 +++$+++ u3664 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ SERAFINE +++$+++ Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
L38875 +++$+++ u3658 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
L38874 +++$+++ u3664 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ SERAFINE +++$+++ Andy!
L38872 +++$+++ u3658 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Allo?
L38871 +++$+++ u3664 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ SERAFINE +++$+++ Andy, stop! I think he can help you - 
L39290 +++$+++ u3660 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ DESK OFFICER +++$+++ Yes sir.
L39289 +++$+++ u3662 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ LEDUC +++$+++ Now!
L39288 +++$+++ u3660 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ DESK OFFICER +++$+++ But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
L39287 +++$+++ u3662 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ LEDUC +++$+++ I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert immediately. You can tell the commissioner it's a code red.
L39286 +++$+++ u3660 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ DESK OFFICER +++$+++ Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.
L39285 +++$+++ u3662 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ LEDUC +++$+++ What did she say?
L39284 +++$+++ u3660 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ DESK OFFICER +++$+++ Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
L39283 +++$+++ u3662 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ LEDUC +++$+++ What've you got?
L38822 +++$+++ u3662 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ LEDUC +++$+++ What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you?
L38821 +++$+++ u3663 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
L38820 +++$+++ u3662 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ LEDUC +++$+++ You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
L38819 +++$+++ u3663 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Saint Severin...
L38817 +++$+++ u3663 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.
L38816 +++$+++ u3662 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ LEDUC +++$+++ You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.
L38815 +++$+++ u3663 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Double merde.
L38814 +++$+++ u3662 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ LEDUC +++$+++ Two more nights in this lunar cycle.
L38813 +++$+++ u3663 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Merde.
L38812 +++$+++ u3662 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ LEDUC +++$+++ Twelve thirty-six a.m. here. Twelve forty a.m. here. There's two of them. At least.
L38811 +++$+++ u3662 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ LEDUC +++$+++ Hmmph. At least now there's one person around here who doesn't think I'm crazy.
L38810 +++$+++ u3663 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Okay. So maybe you were right.
L38809 +++$+++ u3662 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ LEDUC +++$+++ Well?
L38689 +++$+++ u3663 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Your uncle was carrying this. The keys to his apartment are in there. I talked to his assistant, Madame Flocquet. You'll be staying there a while?
L38688 +++$+++ u3662 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ LEDUC +++$+++ Here.
L38674 +++$+++ u3663 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ He says -
L38673 +++$+++ u3662 +++$+++ m241 +++$+++ LEDUC +++$+++ Merde.
L41091 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Get on! Anastasia, get on!
L41090 +++$+++ u3666 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANASTASIA +++$+++ Hurry, Grandmama!
L41067 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ When you're older . . .
L41066 +++$+++ u3666 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANASTASIA +++$+++ "Together in Paris"! Oh, when can we be "together in Paris?!
L41065 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
L41064 +++$+++ u3666 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANASTASIA +++$+++ Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
L41063 +++$+++ u3666 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANASTASIA +++$+++ I know, but I had to because . . .
L41062 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
L41061 +++$+++ u3666 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANASTASIA +++$+++ How to read.
L41060 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ What were you showing her?
L41059 +++$+++ u3666 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANASTASIA +++$+++ I was showing Sonya something . . .
L41058 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Why were you so late tonight
L41132 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Then come find me.
L41131 +++$+++ u3670 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ Anya! What if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!
L41130 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do.
L41129 +++$+++ u3670 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
L41128 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ I have to go now, before it gets light.
L41123 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ I'm not sure but look. . .
L41122 +++$+++ u3670 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ Where is your home, Anya?
L41117 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.
L41116 +++$+++ u3670 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ Are you running away?
L41592 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ No. From now on I am your loyal subject ... your highness. By your leave?
L41591 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
L41590 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
L41586 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Cut it out, Vlad! I'm not angry with you anymore - I know how much you needed the money.
L41585 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ Yes, your highness.
L41584 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Poor Meetoo!
L41583 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ Yes, your highness.
L41582 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!
L41397 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Not you. Him.
L41396 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ I shant!
L41395 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ You'll laugh.
L41394 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ Come out! I can do alterations.
L41393 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ No! I look ridiculous!
L41383 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ You must have.
L41382 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ Did I tell you that?
L41373 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess!  Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly...
L41372 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ We're just going to refresh your memory...
L41368 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ Ah ... the Lady Sophie... The ravishing first cousin, once removed, from the Empress. We must convince Sophie that you are the Princess before we'll be granted a meeting with the Empress ... your grandmother, I mean.
L41367 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Who's Sophie?
L41366 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie.
L41356 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ I'm fine.
L41355 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ Is everyone all right?
L41348 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to
L41347 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Noooo....
L41242 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
L41241 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
L41201 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ Good day!
L41200 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Well, I don't have any money . . .
L41199 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ Providing travel papers is illeagal!  I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you.  Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .
L41198 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
L41197 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ Who did you hear it from?
L41633 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ I'll never let go!
L41632 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Don't let me go!
L41621 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Anya... where are we?
L41620 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Dmitri?
L41560 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ I'm glad you	did too.
L41559 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
L41497 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ No! I thought you believed in me! It was all a lie!
L41496 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ No! Well, yes, but
L41495 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
L41494 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Anya, wait!
L41486 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Don't be
L41485 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ I'm so scared...
L41447 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ You'll convince her. You have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong... and beautiful ... even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know.
L41446 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
L41445 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Nervous?
L41434 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ It's okay. Didn't hurt..
