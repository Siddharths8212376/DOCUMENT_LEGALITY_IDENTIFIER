L141852 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What's the charge?
L141829 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You're the boss.  Just don't make me repeat myself.  I hate that.
L141828 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
L141827 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches!  You've got to listen to me.
L141826 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Yes!  Don't let's get into this thing where I have to repeat myself!
L141825 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ You bit someone's nose off?
L141824 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I bit the bastard's nose off.
L141788 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Was waiting till I knew you better.  Johnny Dancer, huh? Sounds like a racehorse.
L141787 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
L141786 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What was your horse's name?
L141785 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry.  Just call and make an appointment.
L141784 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I better get going.
L141783 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ No.
L141782 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
L141781 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ I think you're different.
L141780 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You think I'm crazy.
L141779 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ I can't promise you anything.
L141778 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You going to warn him?
L141777 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Not exactly the kind of thing a Secret Service Agent can throw himself on top of.
L141776 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ <u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
L141775 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry.  We're talking billions. Motive enough?
L141774 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Motive?
L141773 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
L141772 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Well, I -- Jerry, the point.  Get there.  What does it have to do with the President?
L141771 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
L141770 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Not for years.
L141769 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Do you still ride?
L141768 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ I still don't see what it has to do with the President.
L141767 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Not testing.  <u>Using</u>.  Nukes are passe.  This is the weapon of the future.
L141766 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
L141765 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
L141764 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ I don't see the connection.
L142403 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Then I can't be hurt anymore.
L142402 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ Liza Sutton is dead.
L142384 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You've never seen her run.
L142383 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.
L142382 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ <u>Liza</u>!
L142381 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ We've arranged for you to take the blame.  Everyone knows how you've been harassing the poor girl.
L141803 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ Lysergic acid diethylamide... With a little kicker of my own.  Surely it must be coming back to you by now?
L141802 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What's that?
L141801 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Could you be a little more specific?
L141800 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
L141799 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ That's great.  Good for you.
L141798 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ I'm a very patient man.
L141796 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well.
L141795 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Do I know you?
L142521 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Whatever.
L142520 +++$+++ u4596 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LOWRY +++$+++ Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
L142519 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Then screw you.  I'll rot.
L142518 +++$+++ u4596 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LOWRY +++$+++ I don't know...
L142517 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
L142516 +++$+++ u4596 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LOWRY +++$+++ We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
L142515 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'll do it.  On one condition.  I want to make sure she's okay.
L142512 +++$+++ u4596 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LOWRY +++$+++ That's your option.  Ours could be to keep you locked up for a very long time.  In case you didn't know it, you're crazy.
L142511 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'm leaning toward no.
L142510 +++$+++ u4596 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LOWRY +++$+++ You made your decision yet?
L142116 +++$+++ u4596 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LOWRY +++$+++ Well, I don't know if --
L142115 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
L142114 +++$+++ u4596 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LOWRY +++$+++ It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions?  Are they honorable?
L142113 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You're here because you figured I might show up.
L142112 +++$+++ u4596 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LOWRY +++$+++ That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
L142111 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
L142110 +++$+++ u4596 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LOWRY +++$+++ I'm not sure what you mean.
L142109 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?
L142108 +++$+++ u4596 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LOWRY +++$+++ You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
L142107 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Thank you.
L142282 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ I want this box rigged with a beacon!
L142281 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ It's okay.  I'm game.
L142268 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ I don't understand.
L142267 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ In Jerry's safety deposit box.
L142265 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ You sound so sure.
L142264 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
L142263 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
L142262 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
L142261 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
L142260 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ You do recognize it then?
L142259 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Where'd you get it?
L142257 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ So you'll believe what I tell you next.  Because I need to find Jerry.  And I don't think I can do that without you.
L142256 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
L142255 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ Belief is immaterial.  What's important is the truth... It's been my job to find Jerry.  I'm very much responsible for him.
L142254 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ I don't believe you.
L142253 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
L142252 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ I'm still listening.
L142248 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ Yes, that's right.
L142247 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
L142246 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ <u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
L142245 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ A dog.
L142244 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ And what did I say?
L142243 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Jerry told me he bit your nose.
L142242 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ It was.  It was.
L142241 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
L142240 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
L142239 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
L142238 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
L142237 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Terminal?
L142236 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ We experimented with hallucinogens.  We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state.  We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
L142235 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ I am impressed.  We used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card.
L142234 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
L142233 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
L142232 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
L142231 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
L142230 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
L142229 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ Years ago, I worked for the C.I.A. in the M.K. ULTRA program.  Are you familiar with it?
L142228 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Truth'll set you free.  I'm listening.
L142227 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ What I'm about to tell you is partially documented.  The Freedom of Information Act saw to that. But much more of it isn't.  For reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. Repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself.
L142226 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ Please, sit.
L142225 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Fine.  What the hell is going on?
L142224 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ If you're as impressed to see me as I am to see you, you're very impressed indeed.  How's Jerry feeling this morning?
L141944 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ Re-educating trained killers in the ways of polite society. Making sure the men who've gone over the edge won't hurt anyone. That sort of thing.
L141943 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
L141942 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ We're very specialized.
L141941 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.
L141940 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ Only on the football field.
L141939 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
L141938 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ The truth shall make you free.
L141937 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?
L141934 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ A year ago I was leaving work late one night.  Two guys tried to mug me.  It was horrible.  Jerry came out of nowhere.  To my rescue. Then he started coming to see me.  Could've been a storybook if he wasn't crazy.  At first I did my beat to avoid him.  But there's something inside Jerry and...  Jerry made me see it.  <u>He made me</u> <u>see him</u>.  That make sense?
L141933 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
L141932 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Excuse me?
L141931 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
L141930 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
L141929 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ <u>Why you</u>?
L141928 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
L141927 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
L141926 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ You've asked me that one three times.
L141925 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ And you have no idea where he lives?
L141924 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
L141923 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the President?
L141905 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ It was my dog.  Let me ask you a question.  How long have you been acquainted with Jerry?
L141904 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ And you feel bad for it?
L141903 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ You were going to ask about my nose.  The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.
L141902 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Excuse me?
L141901 +++$+++ u4593 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JONAS +++$+++ A dog bit it.
L141900 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Can I ask you something?
L142140 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
L142139 +++$+++ u4594 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LAWYER +++$+++ Liza, settle a bet for us.
L141818 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Too bad.  Because I'm terrible at 'yes.'
L141817 +++$+++ u4594 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LAWYER +++$+++ I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
L141816 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
L141815 +++$+++ u4594 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LAWYER +++$+++ Night after that?
L141814 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Working.
L141813 +++$+++ u4594 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LAWYER +++$+++ Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
L141812 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Working.
L141811 +++$+++ u4594 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LAWYER +++$+++ So, you doing anything tonight?
L142395 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Agent Lowry?
L142394 +++$+++ u4597 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ Go ahead, Miss Sutton.
L142390 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Then this is a goddamn emergency.
L142389 +++$+++ u4597 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ Yes.
L142388 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Do you <u>have</u> an Agent Lowry in your New York office?
L142387 +++$+++ u4597 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
L142386 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
L142385 +++$+++ u4597 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ Federal Bureau of Investigation.
L142277 +++$+++ u4598 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ What the hell does that mean?
L142276 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Go to the northeast corner.  Call a cab.  Bring the pizza.  Then there's a poem.  Roses are red, violets are blue, if the Pope goes to Washington, I would, too.
L142138 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ -- Understood.
L142137 +++$+++ u4598 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>?
L142136 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
L142135 +++$+++ u4598 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  Why is that?
L142134 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
L142133 +++$+++ u4598 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre.
L142132 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ This doesn't make sense.
L142131 +++$+++ u4598 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
L141760 +++$+++ u4598 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.
L141759 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
L141758 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Not today...
L141757 +++$+++ u4598 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Ah, your psychotic is here.
L142430 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ I don't think so.
L142429 +++$+++ u4596 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LOWRY +++$+++ That you come with me.
L142428 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ What do you suggest?
L142427 +++$+++ u4596 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LOWRY +++$+++ Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
