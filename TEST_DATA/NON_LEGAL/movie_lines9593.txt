L78659 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Home.  <u>Home</u>.  <u>Home</u>!
L78658 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ Folks, be reasonable here.  I'm at your service.  You be the judge. I'm a harmless guy.  Try me.
L78645 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ Hey <u>you've</u> been on Saturn!  I <u>hate</u> those sandworms!  <u>Yecchhh</u>! I've lost a lot of buddies to sandworms.  So a daughter?  She got good legs? God I love a young leg.
L78644 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Just one daughter.
L78643 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
L78642 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Just get some people out of our house.
L78638 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ You're the dead.
L78637 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ We're...
L78636 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ All right.  Who are you?
L78865 +++$+++ u3985 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Forget him.  He'll remain with his whores until someone calls him.  You need to worry about people like <u>Otho</u>.  There are a lot of phony trance mediums.  They usually can't make the formulas work, but if Otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you.  As in -- <u>exorcism</u>.
L78864 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ What about Betelgeuse?
L78790 +++$+++ u3985 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ You people have really screwed up!  I received word that you allowed yourselves to be <u>photographed</u>.  And you let Betelgeuse out and didn't put him back, and you let Otho get ahold of the handbook.
L78789 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ About what?
L78788 +++$+++ u3985 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture!  We've got some serious talking to do.
L78523 +++$+++ u3985 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Yeah.  He still tries popping up all over the place.  But he can't join the party unless you call on him.  Get the Deetzes out by yourselves! I gotta go.
L78522 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Our cemetery?
L78521 +++$+++ u3985 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
L78520 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ What do you mean?  What's he do?
L78519 +++$+++ u3985 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ No, you don't!  He does not work well with others.
L78517 +++$+++ u3985 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ No.  You don't want his help.
L78516 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ If... we have trouble.  What about the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...
L78515 +++$+++ u3985 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Pity.  Murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  Just look at Amityville.  He was one of my boys.  Didn't have to give that one any lessons. From day one... But I must be off ... I've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
L78514 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ No.
L78505 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Yes.
L78504 +++$+++ u3985 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ -- Like you used to be?
L78501 +++$+++ u3985 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ What do you expect?  You're dead.
L78500 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ We're very unhappy.
L78497 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ We need help.  We deserve help.
L78496 +++$+++ u3985 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
L78495 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Are you Juno, our case worker?
L78494 +++$+++ u3985 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I'd nearly given up on you.  I was about to leave.  I do have other clients.
L79029 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way.  I said it was against my religion.  I got a C.
L79028 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ How'd you do on the science test?
L78893 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Step... mother.
L78892 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ So, <u>never</u> let Beetle Juice out. Never.  Besides...  We're thinking about letting everyone stay... You and your father and mother can stay too.
L78889 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Life is just... too awful.
L78888 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
L78887 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I want to be dead too.
L78886 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ No, Lydia, we're dead.
L78885 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
L78769 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ No, wait!
L78768 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!
L78590 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
L78589 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I don't wear that stuff to <u>bed</u>. Besides, there's <u>nothing</u> wrong with it.  I'm getting out of here.
L78583 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Funeral.  God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry?
L78582 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.
L78567 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I always tell the truth.  Of course I can see you.
L78566 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Tell the truth.
L78563 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ We're practicing.
L78562 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ You're not gross.  Why were you wearing a sheet?
L78561 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ If I had seen a ghost at your age, I would have been frightened out of my wits.
L78176 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ 'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.
L78175 +++$+++ u3984 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things.
L78174 +++$+++ u3984 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Barbara Maitland, sweetie, you just listen now.  This house is too big.  It really ought to be for a couple with a family.
L78173 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ And live in what, our station wagon?
L78172 +++$+++ u3984 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
L78171 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
L78170 +++$+++ u3984 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
L78169 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
L78168 +++$+++ u3984 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Honey -- today I am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
L78167 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ That's right, Jane.  Complete vacation.
L78166 +++$+++ u3984 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you. I heard you were on vacation!
L78959 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ I'm beeyoo-teeful.
L78958 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Your qu...?  But you're...
L78957 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ 
L78956 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ W... What is it?
L78955 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ Then <u>I'll</u> help them.  For a price.
L78954 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ ... I will.
L78953 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ Can you help <u>me</u>?
L78952 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ You've got to help them.
L78951 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ So... You're ready for me now?
L78857 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
L78856 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
L78855 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.
L78854 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.
L78853 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ You've <u>got</u> to say it!
L78852 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
L78851 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ Just <u>say</u> it.
L78850 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ God, you're anatomically correct!
L78849 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.  And then <u>you'll</u> be free.
L78848 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
L78847 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ That's it!
L78846 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I am <u>not</u>!  Beetle... Juice?
L78845 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are <u>dumb</u>!
L78844 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit battle? Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?
L78841 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ Good girrrl!
L78840 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Beetle!
L78839 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
L78838 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I don't know what that signal means.
L78837 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Your fingers are so small I can't see them.  First word -- two syllables.
L78836 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ No, dummy.  Two.
L78835 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Three syllables.
L78832 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ Of course you do.
L78831 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Yes.
L78830 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
L78829 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I... I don't know what your name is.
L78828 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
L78827 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Yeah.
L78826 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
L78825 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
L78824 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
L78823 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I think so.
L78822 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?
L78821 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I want to get in.
L78820 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
L78819 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Are you a spirit too?
L78818 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
L78817 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Where'd they go?
L78816 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
L78815 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
L78814 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
L78812 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ They're dead.
L78811 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come for the last time.  Where are you?  Barb...
L78965 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ It's too late, Charles.  I'm sorry.
L78964 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Otho?
L78671 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ I am ashamed to say he is.  Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget it.  You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
L78670 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ He's your cousin.
L78669 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ He's a cloven-hooved beast!
L78668 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Otho, you've got to help me get Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable.
L78301 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me out of it.  I am here to relax and clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I mean to do it.
L78300 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ Yes, of course you are.  Well, Otho had an intuition.  Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  And it certainly is.  Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>!
L78911 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ Not these people!  They are ruthless!
L78910 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ They're probably guilty about what they did to me.
L78806 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ I think she's in with them.
L78805 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Why not?
L78804 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ Just don't tell Lydia.
L78803 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing...
L78802 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
L78801 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
L78800 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ Otho'll know what to do.
L78799 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
L78798 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
L78386 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ We're going to have a lot to do tomorrow... The Goodwill truck is coming, and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it. Should have it fumigated too.  I saw a fly today.
L78385 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ Lydia, at your age, you are <u>so</u> <u>young</u>.  Charles, we need to call that awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door.  Can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission?
L78374 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better.
L78373 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
L78295 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
L78294 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ It's <u>Otho</u>!
L78903 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.
L78902 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ They're... not here anymore.
L78762 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Otho, could you actually... do something with them?
L78761 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
L78760 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ I'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts.
L78759 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Delia will cook...
L78758 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I cannot believe this.
L78757 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Now, let's get back to business. I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately.  I can make history here!  I'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.
L78750 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
L78749 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
L78745 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Listen, you guys.  These ghosts are really nice people.  I think we scared them off.  Let's just leave them alone.  Okay?
L78744 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Answer your mother.
L78735 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ They're ghosts.  They do what they want.
L78734 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ The attic room is locked --
L78605 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ <u>This is not a joke</u>!  That sheet was full of ghosts.
L78604 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
L78603 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --
L78602 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ ... sheets.
L78601 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Stepmother's...
L78600 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
L78599 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Dad.  Do you believe me?
L78448 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Lydia.  What the hell is the point of my moving up here if you people won't let me relax?  Go help your mother.
L78447 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
L78446 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!
L78428 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I'm lonely.
L78427 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ What?
L78425 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ ... asked you for something, didn't she?  I'm going down to relax.  I want a noise-free zone. Do you understand?  Noise free.
L78424 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Stepmother.
L78423 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway, this can wait.  We'll get a crowbar later.  Your mother...
L78421 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Let me have it.
L78420 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I was just trying to open the door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key.
L78414 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Lydia.  Try to be civil.  I'm going to see if I can set up a noise-free zone in the study.
L78413 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
L78412 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Where is your mother?
L78381 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
L78380 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
L78378 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room.
L78377 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
L78290 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Delia hates it.
L78289 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ What do you think, honey?
L78947 +++$+++ u3987 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ MAXIE +++$+++ They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.
L78946 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Are they suffering?
L78913 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Otho, can you do it?
L78912 +++$+++ u3987 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ MAXIE +++$+++ I don't care from guilt.  I just want to <u>see</u> them.
L78541 +++$+++ u3987 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ MAXIE +++$+++ Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up there, ya hear?
L78540 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
L78539 +++$+++ u3987 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ MAXIE +++$+++ No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
L78538 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody...
L78536 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ No, no, c'mon, Max, you know me. I've got plans.  You gotta come up here and see, then I'll tell you about it.
L78535 +++$+++ u3987 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ MAXIE +++$+++ Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
L78534 +++$+++ u3982 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Not <u>a building</u>!  That's the beauty of it.  I think I can buy the <u>whole town</u>.  These people don't know the value of their property!
L78756 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I'm sorry already.
L78755 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
L78742 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ It doesn't matter.  What matters is I've got a roomful of guests down there, who think I'm a fraud.  I am going to teach you something here Lydia.  You've <u>got</u> to take the right tone in things like this, or people -- whether they're dead or alive -- people will walk all <u>over</u> you.  Come on out, or I will make death so miserable that you will wish you had never <u>lived</u>!
L78741 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Shhhh.  They didn't commit suicide.
L78740 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ All right, you dead people!  Come on out, or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with!
L78727 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.
L78726 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
L78681 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ Tried to convince me that this house is haunted.  Kids.  Kids. Kids!  I love them.
L78680 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ It wasn't a joke.
L78679 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon.
L78678 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I saw some ghosts.
