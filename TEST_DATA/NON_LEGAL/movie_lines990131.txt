L388783 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I donít think so.
L388782 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ Let's just bring you in safely, and then we'll worry about that, okay?  Were you followed?
L388781 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
L388780 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ <u>Are you intact</u>?
L388779 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ They knew we were coming.  Golitsynís dead too.  The disk is gone.
L388778 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ Are you damaged?
L388777 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- donít know
L388776 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ Whoís dead?
L388775 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Theyíre dead.
L388774 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ Go ahead.
L388773 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Go secure.
L388772 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ This is Kittridge.
L389236 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any better I'll always think of you that way.
L389235 +++$+++ u6639 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
L389234 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
L389233 +++$+++ u6639 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
L389232 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
L389231 +++$+++ u6639 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Why don't you come back with me?
L389230 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
L389229 +++$+++ u6639 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
L389228 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
L389227 +++$+++ u6639 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
L389226 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You're more than that, Luther.  They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  They want you back in.
L389225 +++$+++ u6639 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
L389224 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Here's to  you, Luther.   To being off the disavowed list.
L389222 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.
L389221 +++$+++ u6639 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
L389220 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ About what?
L389219 +++$+++ u6639 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Reach your folks?  How they feeling?
L389053 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I'll get you close.
L389052 +++$+++ u6639 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close.
L389051 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
L389050 +++$+++ u6639 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
L389049 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.
L389048 +++$+++ u6639 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ What makes you trust me?
L389047 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Now I want you to hold onto it.
L389046 +++$+++ u6639 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.
L388956 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down.
L388955 +++$+++ u6639 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal.
L388954 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.
L388953 +++$+++ u6639 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ And I get to keep the equipment when we're done.
L388951 +++$+++ u6639 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Thinking Machine laptops, I'm talking about the 686 prototypes -- <u>with</u> the artificial intelligence Risk chip --
L388950 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ May take a little time. That's not what Claire tells me about you.
L388947 +++$+++ u6639 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's --
L388946 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
L388945 +++$+++ u6639 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that..  With that exceptional piece of work.
L388944 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of.  What'd they used to call you?  The Net Ranger?  Phineas Phreak?  The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom.
L388941 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Profitable.
L388940 +++$+++ u6639 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ What kind?
L388939 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Information.
L388938 +++$+++ u6639 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ What are we downloading?
L389135 +++$+++ u6641 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I wouldnít worry about him.  Once youíve got the money -- heíll find you.
L389134 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ What about Job?
L389133 +++$+++ u6641 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
L389132 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ It doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
L389131 +++$+++ u6641 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnít prelude a meeting in private.
L388915 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I wouldn't dream of it.
L388914 +++$+++ u6641 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm going to have to front you personally.  Don't lose that money without losing your life.
L388913 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I'm not being dropped anywhere without my money.
L388912 +++$+++ u6641 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
L388911 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ How will you make sure Job will be there?
L388910 +++$+++ u6641 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
L388909 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ <u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
L388908 +++$+++ u6641 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
L388907 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ What was your deal with Job?
L388906 +++$+++ u6641 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
L388905 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?
L388894 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up first.
L388893 +++$+++ u6641 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Very good.
L388892 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
L388891 +++$+++ u6641 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Mm - Hmmm...
L388890 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
L388889 +++$+++ u6641 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
L388888 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
L388887 +++$+++ u6641 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Why should I?
L388886 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
L388885 +++$+++ u6641 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
L388884 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ That's the question I want to ask Job.
L388883 +++$+++ u6641 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Why, may I ask?
L388882 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
L388881 +++$+++ u6641 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Ah, but, we're asking about you.
L388880 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Like Job?
L388879 +++$+++ u6641 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
L388878 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
L388877 +++$+++ u6641 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ It's quite out of the question.
L388876 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
L388875 +++$+++ u6641 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ On what?
L388874 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ That depends.
L388873 +++$+++ u6641 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
L388872 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
L388871 +++$+++ u6641 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
L388870 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I need one hundred thousand dollars.
L388869 +++$+++ u6641 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Who are you and what are you doing here?
L388995 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Let's move!
L388994 +++$+++ u6634 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ GUARD RANDALL +++$+++ Wait!  Hold it - it's on. Let's go.
L388990 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Do you <u>want</u> to blow the fire through the whole building?
L388989 +++$+++ u6634 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ GUARD RANDALL +++$+++ Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
L388988 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I gotta go in there and shut it down!
L388987 +++$+++ u6634 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ GUARD RANDALL +++$+++ Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
L388986 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ What sector's the air conditioning?
L389035 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ What's the matter, you don't know this trick?
L389034 +++$+++ u6638 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KRIEGER +++$+++ That's not it.  That's not the list.
L389029 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ My contact is extremely shy.
L389028 +++$+++ u6638 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KRIEGER +++$+++ You're not going to any meeting without me.
L389015 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ We're not outta here yet.
L389014 +++$+++ u6638 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KRIEGER +++$+++ Merci.
L389002 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Time up.
L389001 +++$+++ u6638 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KRIEGER +++$+++ We'll see.
L389000 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Zero body count.
L388932 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ In Langley.
L388931 +++$+++ u6638 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KRIEGER +++$+++ Where exactly is it?
L388930 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ IMF mainframe.
L388929 +++$+++ u6638 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KRIEGER +++$+++ Bank?
L388928 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.
L388737 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Stairway, youíre wrapped, go to transport.
L388736 +++$+++ u6635 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Roger that.  Opening doors now.
L388735 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll.
L388730 +++$+++ u6635 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Give me a break, Pops.
L388729 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack.
L388723 +++$+++ u6635 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I didn't touch it.
L388722 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Jack.  Jack.
L388687 +++$+++ u6635 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Just don't chew it.
L388686 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Give me the God damn gum.
L388682 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Always.
L388681 +++$+++ u6635 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Sorry, am I interrupting?
L388629 +++$+++ u6635 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Just waiting for you, tubs.
L388628 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
L388627 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Jack.
L388626 +++$+++ u6635 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Claire.
L388761 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ No, weíre going to recover the disk, understand?!  Now move!
L388760 +++$+++ u6643 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
L388759 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Iím coming to you.
L388755 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Jim we canít.
L388754 +++$+++ u6643 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Ethan.  Heís out of pocket.
L388750 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Jim.  Jim.  Heís in the open.
L388749 +++$+++ u6643 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ The package is in the open.
L388726 +++$+++ u6643 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ What about my coat?  I'll freeze.
L388725 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors.
L388719 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Right, right.  Good.
L388718 +++$+++ u6643 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Higher.
L388717 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Higher.  Higher.
L388900 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I'd say you've got about two minutes.
L388899 +++$+++ u6640 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MATTHIAS +++$+++ Forty-four.  Forty-five.
L388868 +++$+++ u6640 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MATTHIAS +++$+++ Very well.
L388867 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I'm willing to take the chance.
L388866 +++$+++ u6640 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MATTHIAS +++$+++ If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
L388865 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
L388864 +++$+++ u6640 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MATTHIAS +++$+++ Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
L388863 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Then what am I doing here?
L388862 +++$+++ u6640 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MATTHIAS +++$+++ You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
L388861 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I thought I was going to see Max.
L388860 +++$+++ u6640 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MATTHIAS +++$+++ You wish to meet Max?  This is the price of admission.
L388859 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Why?
L388858 +++$+++ u6640 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MATTHIAS +++$+++ Would you remove your hat please?
L389203 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ Ethan - Iíve always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth.  It can kill you.
L389202 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Jim, itís over.
L389196 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Youíre wrong about one thing.  Iím not the only one whoís seen you alive.
L389195 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.
L389194 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ Donít flatter yourself - six was for <u>Eastern Europe</u>.  You made a lousy deal - ten for the world?  What is that?  But I needed you for the transfer with Max.  I got a little extra change;  and you got a little extra too.
L389193 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Arenít you going to thank me Jim.  Ten million is better than six.
L389188 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ Keep counting Claire.
L389187 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?
L389181 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ But, he didnít know about you.  In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods.  "Thou shall not covet thy Neighbourís wife", Ethan.  Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it.  And like all the worldís lovers, heís tortured by the same, one pathetic question - "does she feel the same way I do?"
L389180 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I knew about Jim.
L389176 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ They stamped it, didnít they?  Those damn Gideons.
L389175 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Before London.  But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
L389117 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ Good luck.
L389116 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ And get a doctor.
L389115 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ You got it.
L389114 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Iíll call you from Paris.
L389113 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ I usually am.
L389112 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Youíre probably right.
L389111 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ - no.  She canít know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  Thereís too much at stake, Ethan.

God knows what sheís had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..

L389101 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ ..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How <i>dare</i> he?  You realize itís over, youíre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youíve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, weíll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!

L389090 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight.
L389089 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I remember..
L389088 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ Hey, I showed 'em to you!

L389085 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
L389084 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ - but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
L389083 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ - and picked us up in the States -
L389082 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ ..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
