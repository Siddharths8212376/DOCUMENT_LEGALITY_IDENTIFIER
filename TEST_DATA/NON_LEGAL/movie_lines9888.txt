L262249 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Yeah.
L262248 +++$+++ u5737 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it.
L262243 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ ...and open the French doors and go on the balcony --
L262242 +++$+++ u5737 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yes.
L262241 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown...
L262227 +++$+++ u5737 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ And in the material. That's...that's unpolished red granite. 
L262226 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L262225 +++$+++ u5737 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ The design's deliberately noncontextural.  But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.
L262224 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ It's terrific!
L262223 +++$+++ u5737 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yeah.
L262220 +++$+++ u5737 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What time do you get off?
L262219 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Yeah.
L262215 +++$+++ u5737 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm an architect.
L262214 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Oh, what, what do you do?
L262211 +++$+++ u5737 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I cry at the opera.
L262210 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
L262206 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ What makes you think we're more interesting?
L262205 +++$+++ u5737 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
L262204 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
L262203 +++$+++ u5737 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You're Holly.
L262197 +++$+++ u5737 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Ah! HOLLY  Now.
L262196 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
L262190 +++$+++ u5737 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Oh no.  Not at all.
L262189 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Really?  Is the food that bad?
L262188 +++$+++ u5737 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Is this your first job?
L262187 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ We're actresses.
L262186 +++$+++ u5737 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
L262185 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
L262184 +++$+++ u5737 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I can't resist.
L262183 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
L262182 +++$+++ u5737 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Excuse me, are there any more claims?
L262125 +++$+++ u5738 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DR. ABEL +++$+++ It's nothing.  Will you trust me?
L262124 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Like what?
L262123 +++$+++ u5738 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DR. ABEL +++$+++ You know, there's no reason for panic.  I just want to rule out some things.
L262122 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all?  I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels.  So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.
L262121 +++$+++ u5738 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DR. ABEL +++$+++ Now, don't get alarmed.  These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here.  I mean, it's, it's nothing.
L262120 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ The hospital?  What kind of tests?
L262119 +++$+++ u5738 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DR. ABEL +++$+++ What I'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I'd like to have them run some tests.
L262118 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
L262117 +++$+++ u5738 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DR. ABEL +++$+++ And it's just in one ear?
L262116 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?
L262115 +++$+++ u5738 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DR. ABEL +++$+++ You've had some dizzy spells.  What about ringing and buzzing? Have you, uh, noticed any of that?
L262114 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Oh, uh, about a month ago.  Wha- what do I have?
L262113 +++$+++ u5738 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DR. ABEL +++$+++ When did you first notice this?
L262112 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.
L262111 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me.
L262110 +++$+++ u5738 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DR. ABEL +++$+++ Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus?
L262109 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Really?!
L262108 +++$+++ u5738 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DR. ABEL +++$+++ Well, I'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear.
L262107 +++$+++ u5738 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DR. ABEL +++$+++ Let's take a look.
L262106 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Now I ca-can't remember.
L262105 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Yes, a little dizziness, and I think, I think I'm developing a hearing loss in my right ear  ...or my left ear, my, my left...oh, n-n-n-no.  No, I'm sorry.  It was my right, my right, my right or my left ear.
L262104 +++$+++ u5738 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DR. ABEL +++$+++ You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
L262103 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
L262102 +++$+++ u5738 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DR. ABEL +++$+++ ...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
L262101 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Mm-hm.
L262100 +++$+++ u5738 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DR. ABEL +++$+++ You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
L262099 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
L262097 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ This time I really think I have something.
L262096 +++$+++ u5738 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DR. ABEL +++$+++ So what's the, uh, problem this time?
L262510 +++$+++ u5739 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DUSTY +++$+++ Are you okay?  You look-- You're sweatin'. ELLIOT  Yeah.  Yeah, I just-just need so- some-some fresh air.  It's probably something I ate.  I'll-I'll walk. You go ahead.
L262509 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
L262508 +++$+++ u5739 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DUSTY +++$+++ It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
L262507 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
L262506 +++$+++ u5739 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DUSTY +++$+++ What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?
L262445 +++$+++ u5739 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DUSTY +++$+++ Yeah, I got an Andy Warhol.  And I got a Frank Stella, too.  Oh, it's very beautiful.  Big, weird...you know.  If you stare at that Stella too long, the colors just seem to float. It's kinda weird.
L262444 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
L262443 +++$+++ u5739 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DUSTY +++$+++ How ya doin', man?
L262441 +++$+++ u5739 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DUSTY +++$+++ Yeah.  It's kind of a weird place, actually.  A lotta wall space. 
L262440 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it.
L262457 +++$+++ u5739 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DUSTY +++$+++ 'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. 
L262456 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
L262455 +++$+++ u5739 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DUSTY +++$+++ Well, are...are they big?
L262454 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Frederick's done this whole new series that I'm sure you would really love.
L262449 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L262448 +++$+++ u5739 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DUSTY +++$+++ I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
L262447 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Yeah?
L262446 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
L262439 +++$+++ u5739 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ DUSTY +++$+++ Hi.
L262438 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Hi, Dusty.
L262019 +++$+++ u5740 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...cannot go on the air.
L262018 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ We--
L262015 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ We nev-- We don't name names!  We say the Pope.
L262014 +++$+++ u5740 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yes, but you name names.
L262013 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
L262012 +++$+++ u5740 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...with the affiliates.
L262011 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Could you--
L262010 +++$+++ u5740 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Child molestation is a touchy subject...
L262009 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Okay.  Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty? 
L262008 +++$+++ u5740 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Ed Smythe, yes.
L262007 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You--  Standards and Practices?
L263053 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
L263052 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Lee...
L263051 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I care a great deal about him, yes.
L263050 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ And you're in love overnight?
L263046 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else.
L263045 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
L263044 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
L263043 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ But it hasn't been forever. 
L263042 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I've got to be honest with you.  I met someone else.  I've met someone else.  I...I told you I wasn't going to wait forever.
L263041 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
L263040 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Look, I'm just as much at fault.
L263039 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
L263038 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ It's over, Elliot.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  It's over.  I can't see you anymore.
L263011 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh, not here.  There are too many people around.
L263010 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Is something wrong?
L263009 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ No.
L263008 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ You've been very cold to me tonight.
L262632 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I want you to take care of me... And I love when you do things to me.
L262631 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
L262630 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I know she must be a really passionate person.
L262629 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh, all the time.
L262628 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ You really do have those thoughts, don't you?
L262627 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Oh, my God.
L262626 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
L262625 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
L262624 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ That was just perfect.  You've ruined me for anyone else.
L262623 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I know it isn't.
L262622 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ This is not an easy situation.
L262619 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.
L262618 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.
L262616 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ No, no-no-no, I'm sure.
L262615 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I didn't sleep all night.
L262614 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Lee... uh...
L262613 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I almost didn't.
L262612 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ I thought you weren't coming.
L262544 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh, please, I have to go.  I have to get my teeth cleaned.
L262543 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Your guilt is because you feel the same.
L262542 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh, Elliot, please!  I can't be a party to this!  I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!
L262541 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Yes, but you, you do care about me.
L262540 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
L262539 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.
L262538 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
L262537 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
L262536 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I can't say anything!
L262535 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
L262534 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Poor Hannah.
L262533 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Tch, no!  We were, we were both going in different directions.
L262532 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ But not over me?
L262531 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
L262530 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Why?
L262529 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
L262528 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
L262527 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
L262526 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Not because of me, I hope.
L262525 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
L262524 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
L262523 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Hannah and I are in the last stages.
L262522 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ What do you expect me to say?
L262521 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
L262520 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Why, you know the situation.
L262519 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.
L262518 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh, don't say those words!
L262517 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.
L262516 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?
L262515 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
L262514 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I was looking for you.
L262497 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ I have been in love with you for so long.
L262496 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Elliot!
L262495 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ I...I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.  I have to talk to you for... There's so much that I want to tell you.
L262494 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ What are you doing?!
L262493 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Oh!
L262492 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Lee!  Lee!  Lee, I'm in love with you.
L262491 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Elliot!  Don't!
L262490 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Did you ever read this one--?
L262489 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive.  This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically.
L262486 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Yes, it made me cry  it was so beautiful...so romantic.
L262485 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
L262484 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Oh, right.
L262483 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
