L205224 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ You must carry spare parts --
L205207 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ You can't --it's too dangerous --
L205206 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I'll try to hold it from the other side of the wall, while you push from out here. Maybe that'll do it.
L205200 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Not now. We need air, not greetings!
L205199 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Shouldn't you answer that?
L205184 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ I have no idea.
L205183 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Then how come it worked loose?
L205182 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ But I did. I'm positive!
L205181 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.
L205145 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Doctor -- is it possible? That we're seeing it happen before our eyes?
L205144 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Look at that...they're changing color...
L205106 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ And if it should take more time to get through --
L205105 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ -- at which point the Heart will be stopped by electric shock.
L205040 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I always thought it was nothing but red.
L205039 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.
L204994 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --
L204993 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ A long time, with one man.
L204992 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.
L204991 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
L204990 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
L204989 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure.
L204988 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Now I know...
L204987 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
L204984 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ You may learn to like it.
L204983 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
L204982 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --
L204981 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
L204980 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
L204979 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
L204978 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ We're pushing oxygen today.
L204977 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?
L205404 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.
L205403 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!
L205390 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ We have no alternative. With only six minutes left, we'll just barely make it.
L205389 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ Removal Point? What're you talking about!
L205384 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ The Breath of God...
L205383 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ What's that?
L205382 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ You left something out.
L205381 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ --and certain chemicals involving proteins --
L205379 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Take a close look at your Soul, and your Infinity, and your God out there --
L205378 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ The Soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend Infinity. And the Soul which comes from God is Infinite.
L205369 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ I know only too well what's in the balance, Doctor. And it's not my ego, damned or otherwise.
L205368 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
L205367 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!
L205366 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser.
L205365 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.
L205364 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
L205363 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ I've done all I could with the laser.
L205362 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
L205361 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ It's against my better Judgment...
L205339 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ If we can go in past the Oculomotor Nerve...
L205338 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Yes...
L205337 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity.
L205217 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Nothing -- against all that force.
L205216 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ What can we do?
L205153 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ You can't believe all that's accidental? That there isn't a Creative Intelligence at work --
L205152 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Nothing miraculous about it. Just an interchange of gases. The end product of five hundred million years of Evolution.
L205108 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it.
L205107 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ We can't take a second more.
L205058 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!
L205057 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ But that isn't possible.
L205049 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ That's not the purpose of this mission.  Captain -- keep a straight course -- until you're in the clear.
L205048 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
L205047 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Looks like the molecular structure of proteins.
L205022 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ It's too late now. We must go on.
L205021 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
L205020 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ Doctor, what's wrong?
L205456 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ It's too late!
L205455 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ What about Dr. Michaels?
L205454 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ You said there was a quick way out!
L205436 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ We could follow the Optic Nerve to the corner of the Eye.
L205435 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ The ship's good as finished. We'll have to get out on our own! Is there a quick way out?
L205420 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ It I can clear this Central Nerve, that <may> be enough...
L205419 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Doctor, we've just about had it.
L205413 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...
L205412 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ How does it look, Doctor?
L205376 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ "Proclaiming in incandescent glory The myriad Mind of Man..."
L205375 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ "Yet all the suns that light the Corridors of the Universe shine dim, Before the blazing of a Single Thought -- "
L205284 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Then why not take it?
L205283 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
L205282 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
L205281 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ We'll never get there in time, at this rate.
L205230 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ No, there's no other way.
L205229 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?
L205172 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Maybe we can...  Skipper, is there a snorkel on this sub?
L205171 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ Just a few cells away from a vast air chamber -- one of the countless Alvioli of the Lung -- and we can't get enough to fill a microscopic tank.
L205150 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ Oxygenation...
L205149 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Don't tell me they're refueling...
L205148 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.
L205147 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Mind letting me in on what's going on out there?
L205139 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ They all lead to the same place -- the Lungs.
L205138 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I'd hate to get lost on that Freeway...
L205042 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Quite a piece of plumbing.
L205041 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ Only to the naked eye.  Those corpuscles -- carrying oxygen -- give the stream its color. But the rest of the plasma's very much like sea water. An ocean of life...
L205038 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ Everything can be divided in half, no matter how minute.
L205037 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ You mean Inner Space is endless?
L205036 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ The Medieval Philosophers were right... <Man> is the center of the Universe... We stand in the middle of Infinity, between Outer and Inner Space. And there's no limit to either.
L205407 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Why not? Because of his gibberish about GOd and the Soul? Camouflage -- that's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you! And to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes! And you made it possible!
L205406 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I don't believe that.
L205402 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Nothing has changed as far as <my> authority goes! He is <not> going to operate! Not in the little time we have left! There's no chance of success! It's sheer suicide for all of us!
L205401 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Sorry, but the situation has changed.
L205400 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ I'm in charge of this mission! You were instructed to take orders from me, not give them!
L205393 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ How long will it take to get from here to the Removal Point?
L205392 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
L205391 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?
L205334 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ No, we should reach the base of the Brain shortly. And from there, it's not far to the site of the injury.
L205333 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Looks like quite a way to go...
L205287 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Let's hope they realize the danger.  Captain, I'll give you a new compass heading.
L205286 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ They're tracking us Topside. Once they see where we're going, I'm sure they'll take every precaution.
L205277 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Just what it is. Antibodies, destroying Bacteria -- or any other foreign invader that threatens the System.
L205276 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Looks like somebody declared war.
L205271 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of them soon.
L205270 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Skipper, you're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is.
L205267 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ The Lymphatic System drains off excess fluid from the Tissues. Without it, we'd all swell up like balloons. He reaches the console, begins to take out a new chart.
L205266 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
L205265 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ We're entering the Lymphatic System. Those are nuclei of cells, lining a Duct.
L205261 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ It's possible --
L205260 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Two in a row?
L205259 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
L205258 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
L205257 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.
L205256 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ That line was tampered with...
L205255 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ You have no right to blame Duval --
L205254 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub?
L205253 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Sabotage? I don't understand...
L205252 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Let's hope... So far, somebody's tried to sabotage this mission twice.
L205251 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
L205250 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
L205249 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.
L205248 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Looks like the sea, at dawn.
L205241 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Send the following message...
L205240 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?
L205239 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel.
L205238 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
L205237 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
L205236 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Grant -- wait a minute -- you're not going to dismantle the wireless?
L205212 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.
L205211 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.
L205209 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ There's no other way. Tie my safety line to the sub.
L205208 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --
L205204 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Well, we better get on with it.
L205203 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ In a way -- yes. Those are impurities imbedded in the Lung after a lifetime of 'Civilization.' Carbon from smoke and smog -- specks of dust --
L205176 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ If those Corpuscles can take on air, no reason why we can't.  All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when Benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.  How's that sound to you, Skipper?
L205175 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ At this size, I would certainly think so.
L205126 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Fasten yourselves in. There should be a tremendous surge when the Heart starts up again.
L205125 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ There it is!
L205117 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ It lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime. Forty million beats.
L205116 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Sounds like heavy artillery...
L205083 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Request removal, Mr. Grant.
L205082 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ If there's any chance --
L205081 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Tell them to take us out.
L205078 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
L205077 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
L205074 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Yes... We can go forward on this course, but it means going directly through the Heart.
L205073 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ If we can't go back, is there an alternate route?
L205066 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ A forced joining of an Artery and Vein. Must've happened when Benes was hurt.
L205065 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ A what?
L204920 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Well, it seems to me if you reduce a ship to microscopic size -- and the stream remains constant -- we'd take quite a beating.
L204919 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ About forty miles an hour.
L204902 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ How are you, Miss Peterson?
L204901 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant.
L204853 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --
L204852 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
L204851 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ At an operation?
L204850 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.
L204821 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ And she said it was indelible...
L204820 +++$+++ u5225 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ I'm married.
L204819 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ What'd you do that for?
L204818 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Go ahead.
L204817 +++$+++ u5225 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ May I?
L204816 +++$+++ u5225 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ I can't tell you that either... Excuse me, Mr. Grant, but you've got a smudge on your cheek.
L204815 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Where we going?
L204814 +++$+++ u5225 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ I can't tell you.
L204813 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
L204812 +++$+++ u5225 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
L205498 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Nothing wrong with us! Not a thing! We're fine -- just fine!
L205497 +++$+++ u5228 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ OWENS +++$+++ Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
L205496 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
L205495 +++$+++ u5228 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ OWENS +++$+++ Uh -- what?
L205494 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Who, me? Oh, no! Don't bother about me! We're not hurt! Isn't that right, Skipper?
L205452 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ We can get out through the Lab Section.
L205451 +++$+++ u5228 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ OWENS +++$+++ Come on -- it's no use!
L205446 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Berserk nothing. He's the one who's been sabotaging the mission...  Get this on. Hurry!
L205445 +++$+++ u5228 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ OWENS +++$+++ Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
L205444 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ What happened?
L205409 +++$+++ u5228 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ OWENS +++$+++ Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out.
L205408 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern.  I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help...
L205170 +++$+++ u5228 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ OWENS +++$+++ Enough to breathe, but that's all.
L205169 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Any reserve air?
L204996 +++$+++ u5228 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ OWENS +++$+++ Positions, please. And strap yourselves in.
L204995 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ 'Prepare for Miniaturization'...
L204966 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Remind me to ask you about the love life of an octupus.
L204965 +++$+++ u5228 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ OWENS +++$+++ Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
L204964 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ All in all, quite a canoe...
L204963 +++$+++ u5228 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ OWENS +++$+++ It should work -- theoretically. If it doesn't, the mission's off. The craft's nuclear-powered. Except for your wireless.
L204962 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.
L204961 +++$+++ u5228 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ OWENS +++$+++ They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
L204960 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
L204959 +++$+++ u5228 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ OWENS +++$+++ Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.
L204958 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Atomic fuel?
