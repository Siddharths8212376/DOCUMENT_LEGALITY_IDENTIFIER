L14261 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Oh, Dear God...
L14260 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Was the child full term?
L14259 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ There's nothing here.
L14258 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Take at look at it.
L14257 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Yes.
L14256 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
L14255 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Nothing.
L14254 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Visitors to the convent.
L14253 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Earthquakes?
L14252 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
L14251 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Oh, some time in January.
L14250 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ When would Agnes have conceived the child?
L14249 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Answers.
L14248 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ All right, what do you need.
L14247 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.
L14246 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ How?
L14245 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Aquittal.
L14244 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ What?
L14243 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ There's another choice.
L14242 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
L14241 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
L14240 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I am...
L14239 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Then help her.
L14238 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. 
L14237 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ ???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
L14236 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ ???  
L14235 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God...  ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant...
L14234 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ She is not a child.
L14233 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ ... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
L14232 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I'm only interested...
L14231 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...
L14230 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ It's my affair too.
L14229 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ How dare you tell me to run my affairs!
L14228 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
L14227 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
L14226 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ The Catholic Church...
L14225 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I hate ignorance and stupidity.
L14224 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Nuns... you hate nuns.
L14223 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ What?
L14222 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ You hate us don't you?
L14129 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ And I intend to take her away from Him. That's what you're afraid of isn't it?
L14128 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
L14127 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
L14126 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
L14125 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Not simple, no.
L14124 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
L14123 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ She has it now.
L14122 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
L14121 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
L14120 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
L14119 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
L14065 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ About two years before.
L14064 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ This was before her pregnancy?
L14063 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ She stopped eating completely...
L14062 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ And what happened?
L14061 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I was appalled, just as you are now.
L14060 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ And you weren't shocked?
L14059 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Shortly after she came to us.
L14058 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
L14057 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
L14056 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
L14055 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
L14020 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ No-one knew about Agnes' pregnancy. No-one. Not even Agnes.
L14019 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ That possibility never occurred to you?
L14018 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ That's absurd!
L14017 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
L14016 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Who?
L14015 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ It's possible isn't it?
L14014 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ You don't really believe something like that happened do you?
L14013 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ That she was unconscious, yes!  So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
L14012 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I've already told you what I thought.
L14011 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ And in your eyes?
L14010 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ No... not in the eyes of the police.
L14009 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ So, someone else could have done it.
L14008 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
L14007 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
L14006 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
L14005 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ That's ridiculous...
L14004 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
L14003 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
L14002 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
L14001 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
L14000 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I believe Agnes is different.
L13999 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ What's your opinion?
L13998 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
L13883 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ And I am not from the Middle Ages. I know what you are!  I don't want that mind cut open.
L13882 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I am not with the Inquisition.
L13881 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
L13880 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ The science of psychiatry.
L13879 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally...
L13878 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
L13877 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
L13876 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Why do you think that?
L13875 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
L13874 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Look, someone gave her the baby.
L13873 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception?
L13872 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Why haven't you asked her?
L13871 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
L13870 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ And you didn't try to find out who?
L13869 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Obviously there was.
L13868 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Could there have been anyone else?
L13867 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
L13866 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ What's his name?
L13865 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Yes, but I...
L13864 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Was there a priest?
L13863 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ None as far as I know.
L13862 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ What man had access to her?
L13861 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I haven't a clue.
L13860 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Who was the father?
L13859 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
L13858 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
L13857 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
L13856 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ How did she hide it during the day?
L13855 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Yes.
L13854 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Is that normal?
L13853 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
L13852 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ How did she hide it from the other nuns?
L13851 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ No-one.
L13850 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
L13849 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Unfiltered.
L13848 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I can beat that.
L13847 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ Two packs a day.
L13846 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ You were a smoker?
L13845 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ You must have tons of questions. You may smoke if you want to. Just don't tell any of the Sisters.
L13844 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ ... Thank you.
L13843 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ You can call me Sister.
L13842 +++$+++ u3555 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Yes... I...
L13841 +++$+++ u3557 +++$+++ m234 +++$+++ MOTHER MIRIAM +++$+++ I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...
L14908 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ ... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...
L14907 +++$+++ u3559 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
L14906 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
L14905 +++$+++ u3559 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ The usual ten per cent?
L14904 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. "Mister, can you spare us a copper?" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner.
L14903 +++$+++ u3559 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Of course, John.
L15042 +++$+++ u3560 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ BLONDE +++$+++ The cards... you're bank.
L15041 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ They are?
L15040 +++$+++ u3560 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ BLONDE +++$+++ They're yours.
L15036 +++$+++ u3560 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ BLONDE +++$+++ Your cards... lay them down... face up.
L15035 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ We'd be thrown out.
L15034 +++$+++ u3560 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ BLONDE +++$+++ Lay them down.
L15033 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Eh?
L15032 +++$+++ u3560 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ BLONDE +++$+++ Lay them down.

L15398 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ How about Ding Dong?
L15397 +++$+++ u3561 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.
L15396 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ What they like?
L15395 +++$+++ u3561 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Yeah.

L15392 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ Not much cop without 'em, is it?
L15391 +++$+++ u3561 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Yeah.
L15390 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
L15389 +++$+++ u3561 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
L15388 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
L15387 +++$+++ u3561 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.

L15382 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
L15381 +++$+++ u3561 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ You heard, it gets on my wick.
L15380 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ Y'what?
L15379 +++$+++ u3561 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.
L15378 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ All right, take your hoop and bowl.
L15377 +++$+++ u3561 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Well --
L15376 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ Fifteen and two thirds, actually.

L15370 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ Bet you're only eight and a half.
L15369 +++$+++ u3561 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Nine.
L15368 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ Well! A boy of your age bowling <U>"hoop"</U> at people. How old are you anyway?
L15367 +++$+++ u3561 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Oh don't be so stroppy!
L15366 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?
L15365 +++$+++ u3561 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.
L15622 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ He'll be pulp by now.
L15621 +++$+++ u3562 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ BOYS +++$+++ The police station.
L15620 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ The police have the poor unfortunate lad in the Bridewell.
