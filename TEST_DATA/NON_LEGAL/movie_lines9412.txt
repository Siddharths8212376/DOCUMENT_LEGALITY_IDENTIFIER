L536420 +++$+++ u2982 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ RIKER +++$+++ Why was Data assigned?
L536419 +++$+++ u2987 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ TROI +++$+++ The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
L537083 +++$+++ u2984 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ RU'AFO +++$+++ Isolate one and re-route its command sequence through the auxiliary processor...
L537082 +++$+++ u2986 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ SON'A OFFICER #2 +++$+++ They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
L537081 +++$+++ u2984 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ RU'AFO +++$+++ This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?
L537068 +++$+++ u2986 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ SON'A OFFICER #2 +++$+++ All ship functions are off-line.
L537067 +++$+++ u2984 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ RU'AFO +++$+++ Your scanners must be malfunctioning.

L537065 +++$+++ u2984 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ RU'AFO +++$+++ Exactly as the simulations predicted...

L540238 +++$+++ u2990 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ ADMIRAL HAYES +++$+++ I look forward to reading your report.
L540237 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
L540236 +++$+++ u2990 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ ADMIRAL HAYES +++$+++ It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over.  Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
L540235 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet?
L539574 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
L539573 +++$+++ u2990 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ ADMIRAL HAYES +++$+++ Good hunting. Hayes out.
L539572 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Absolutely.
L539571 +++$+++ u2990 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ ADMIRAL HAYES +++$+++ The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?
L540019 +++$+++ u2991 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not.
L540018 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
L540017 +++$+++ u2991 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
L540016 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.
L540013 +++$+++ u2991 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ That might not be so bad... at least for you.
L540012 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
L540011 +++$+++ u2991 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ You think they're still up there?
L540010 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Not yet.
L540009 +++$+++ u2991 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
L540008 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ How did Doctor Almack react to that?
L540007 +++$+++ u2991 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
L540006 +++$+++ u2991 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...
L540005 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ You actually performed surgery...?
L539788 +++$+++ u2991 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ I'll be fine.  He's a different story.
L539787 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right?
L539774 +++$+++ u2991 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ That'll be interesting.
L539773 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
L539772 +++$+++ u2991 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
L539721 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
L539720 +++$+++ u2991 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ There must be some good people... even in this time.
L539719 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
L539718 +++$+++ u2991 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ Are you saying they won't help us?
L539717 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
L539716 +++$+++ u2991 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ What are we waiting for? Let's go.
L539715 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ As I recall, the town of Resurrection is about two kilometers East of here. They might have a hospital...
L539714 +++$+++ u2991 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
L539713 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding.
L539708 +++$+++ u2991 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
L539707 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ It's Cochrane.
L539661 +++$+++ u2991 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?
L539660 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
L539659 +++$+++ u2991 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
L539658 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Yes...
L539657 +++$+++ u2991 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
L539656 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
L539655 +++$+++ u2991 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
L539651 +++$+++ u2991 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why the hell are we --
L539650 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Montana.  Energize.
L539906 +++$+++ u2994 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage.
L539905 +++$+++ u2991 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
L539761 +++$+++ u2994 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Bag him.
L539760 +++$+++ u2991 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator.
L539755 +++$+++ u2994 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ We have two... but we don't have the juice to run them.
L539754 +++$+++ u2991 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
L539753 +++$+++ u2994 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Is it Japanese?
L539746 +++$+++ u2991 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ At least four hours.
L539745 +++$+++ u2994 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ How long has he been unconscious?
L540182 +++$+++ u2992 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BORG QUEEN +++$+++ Do it.
L540181 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ I believe so.
L540180 +++$+++ u2992 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BORG QUEEN +++$+++ Can you configure it?
L540179 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
L540178 +++$+++ u2992 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BORG QUEEN +++$+++ Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
L540163 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ No.
L540162 +++$+++ u2992 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BORG QUEEN +++$+++ Vulcan?
L540161 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ There is a perimeter alert. A ship has entered sensor range.
L540142 +++$+++ u2992 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BORG QUEEN +++$+++ And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
L540141 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...
L540140 +++$+++ u2992 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BORG QUEEN +++$+++ ... is to yourself. Don't make me hurt you again...
L540139 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
L540138 +++$+++ u2992 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BORG QUEEN +++$+++ Isn't it better like this...?
L540136 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ No... no, please... you cannot...
L540135 +++$+++ u2992 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BORG QUEEN +++$+++ I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now.
L540133 +++$+++ u2992 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BORG QUEEN +++$+++ Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.
L540132 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Yes...
L540131 +++$+++ u2992 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BORG QUEEN +++$+++ A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
L540130 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
L540036 +++$+++ u2992 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BORG QUEEN +++$+++ I'm your creator now.
L540035 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
L540034 +++$+++ u2992 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BORG QUEEN +++$+++ Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
L540033 +++$+++ u2992 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BORG QUEEN +++$+++ More lies.
L540032 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ I wish to... go back to the way I was.
L540031 +++$+++ u2992 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BORG QUEEN +++$+++ You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.
L540030 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ I... do not want this...
L540029 +++$+++ u2992 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BORG QUEEN +++$+++ Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
L540028 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ That is not true. They have tried to help me.
L540027 +++$+++ u2992 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BORG QUEEN +++$+++ They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
L540026 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ No. I will not betray my friends.
L539932 +++$+++ u2992 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BORG QUEEN +++$+++ What a cold description... for such a beautiful gift.
L539931 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
L539930 +++$+++ u2992 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BORG QUEEN +++$+++ Do you know what this is, Data?
L539929 +++$+++ u2992 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BORG QUEEN +++$+++ That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.
L539928 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ I do not know what you are referring to.
L539927 +++$+++ u2992 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BORG QUEEN +++$+++ You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
L539864 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
L539863 +++$+++ u2992 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BORG QUEEN +++$+++ Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
L539858 +++$+++ u2992 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ BORG QUEEN +++$+++ Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
L539857 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?
L539637 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five.
L539636 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Mister Data, I want to know the exact date and time.  Give me a damage report on that missile silo.
L539620 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
L539619 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ What year is it?
L539595 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Contact Starfleet Command.
L539594 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ The vortex is collapsing, sir.
L539592 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Where's the Sphere?
L539591 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ I have helm control.
L539578 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ What?
L539577 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
L539576 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
L539575 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
L539555 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Ready quantum torpedo.
L539554 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.
L539550 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
L539549 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Dispersive armor is holding.
L539856 +++$+++ u3004 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ WOMAN'S VOICE +++$+++ I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
L539855 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
L539854 +++$+++ u3004 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ WOMAN'S VOICE +++$+++ I am the Borg.
L539853 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Who are you?
L539744 +++$+++ u3004 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ WOMAN'S VOICE +++$+++ You are an imperfect being... created by an imperfect being. Finding your weakness is only a matter of time.
L539743 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
L539742 +++$+++ u3004 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ WOMAN'S VOICE +++$+++ But now... they are all one with the Borg.
L539670 +++$+++ u3003 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ TROI +++$+++ I will admit... there are times when I wish I had an emotion chip I could turn on and off.
L539669 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I.
L539668 +++$+++ u3003 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ TROI +++$+++ We still have to make reports on ten more crewmen killed in action. Maybe you should deactivate your emotion chip until we're done.
L539667 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
L539666 +++$+++ u3003 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ TROI +++$+++ Data... are you sure you're all right?
L539665 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Not very well. We met shortly after the Enterprise-E was commissioned. I found her to be a most... promising officer.
L539664 +++$+++ u3003 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ TROI +++$+++ Did you know her?
L539602 +++$+++ u3003 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ TROI +++$+++ But how?
L539601 +++$+++ u2993 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ The planet's surface is covered with Borg technology.  So is the moon... and three other planets in this solar system.
L539771 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
L539770 +++$+++ u2994 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ What did you do to the batteries?
L539766 +++$+++ u2994 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.
L539765 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Where?
L539764 +++$+++ u2994 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ I told you, there's no --
L539763 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Where's the battery room for the hospital?
L539757 +++$+++ u2994 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
L539756 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Juice?
L539750 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
L539749 +++$+++ u2994 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ "APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?
L540185 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ We're crossing the threshold!
L540184 +++$+++ u2995 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ GEORDI +++$+++ They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?
L540174 +++$+++ u2995 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ GEORDI +++$+++ Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help.
L540173 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Their com system must still be down.
L540172 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Picard to Enterprise.  Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me?
L540171 +++$+++ u2995 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ GEORDI +++$+++ Captain, the Enterprise!
L540170 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ One minute to warp threshold...
L540169 +++$+++ u2995 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ GEORDI +++$+++ There's no temporal shielding in here! We're starting to pick up relativistic effects!
L540168 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
L540167 +++$+++ u2995 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ GEORDI +++$+++ The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.
L540166 +++$+++ u2995 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ GEORDI +++$+++ I'm on it...
L540165 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
L540149 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ <U>Engage.</U>
L540148 +++$+++ u2995 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ GEORDI +++$+++ The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
L540147 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
L540146 +++$+++ u2995 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ GEORDI +++$+++ The Vulcans should be out there right now. We need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're going to get their attention.
L540145 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ As they used to say... all systems are go.
L540144 +++$+++ u2995 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ GEORDI +++$+++ Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
L540127 +++$+++ u2995 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ GEORDI +++$+++ Ignore it. We'll be fine.  Prepare for first stage shut-down and separation on my mark...
L540126 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ There's a red light on the second intake valve.
L540125 +++$+++ u2995 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ GEORDI +++$+++ Entering the upper ionospere...
L540124 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Altitude fifty kilometers...
L540123 +++$+++ u2995 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ GEORDI +++$+++ Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...
L540097 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...
L540096 +++$+++ u2995 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ GEORDI +++$+++ What's still there?
L540095 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
L540094 +++$+++ u2995 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ GEORDI +++$+++ No... the door's too thick.
L540092 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ It'll have to wait. Come on.
L540091 +++$+++ u2995 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ GEORDI +++$+++ Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>.
L540089 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ This is Picard. I've suspended the launch sequence.
L540088 +++$+++ u2995 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ GEORDI +++$+++ Captain --
L540070 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ She's a very... determined woman.  Phoenix to control. Mister Lange... let her in.
L540069 +++$+++ u2995 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ GEORDI +++$+++ Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
L540068 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed.
L540064 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Phoenix to control.  Initiating five minute countdown... mark.
L540063 +++$+++ u2995 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ GEORDI +++$+++ Always am.
L540062 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Ready to make a little history?
L539983 +++$+++ u2995 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ GEORDI +++$+++ They used copper pipes in their plumbing... so I melted it down... and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings.  It's not the strongest alloy... but it's better than all this crude aluminum and steel.
L539982 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself?
L539851 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them.
L539850 +++$+++ u2995 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ GEORDI +++$+++ Maybe...  Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos.
L539844 +++$+++ u2995 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ GEORDI +++$+++ We're tearing this place apart looking for them... but the computers are down, and the fires destroyed half the files...so far, nothing.
L539843 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
L539842 +++$+++ u2995 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ GEORDI +++$+++ Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
L539841 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
L539840 +++$+++ u2995 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ GEORDI +++$+++ This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.
L539710 +++$+++ u2995 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ GEORDI +++$+++ It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface.
L539709 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Picard to Enterprise.  Enterprise, please respond.
L539701 +++$+++ u2997 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ There should be some kind of manual release...
L539700 +++$+++ u2995 +++$+++ m196 +++$+++ GEORDI +++$+++ Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
