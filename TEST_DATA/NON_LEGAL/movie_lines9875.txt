L254807 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Sassy my foot! I'm jus' sick and tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up. All we got lef' in the *worl'* is the fambly--an' right down at bottom that's all we *got* to have! Ef some of us dies, we can't he'p that--but ain't nobody else runnin' away!
L254806 +++$+++ u5644 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ PA +++$+++ Jus' sassy, that's all.
L254803 +++$+++ u5644 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ PA +++$+++ I never *seen* her so sassy.  An' she ain't so young, neither!
L254802 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on.

L254798 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!
L254735 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Go get Tom an' Al.  I dunno what to do. I got to feed the fambly. What'm I gonna do with these here?
L254734 +++$+++ u5644 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ PA +++$+++ How 'bout it?
L255213 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Good-by, Tommy.
L255212 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Sure. Good-by.
L255211 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?
L255210 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Me neither.  It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by. 
L255209 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ I don't understan' it, Tom.
L255208 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too.
L255207 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Then what, Tom?
L255206 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...
L255205 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
L255204 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.
L255203 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
L255202 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
L255201 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.
L255200 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I been thinkin' about us, too--about our people livin' like pigs, an' good rich lan' layin' fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'. An' I been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled--
L255199 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ He was a good man.
L255198 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.
L255197 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
L255196 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
L255195 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ I could hide you, Tommy.
L255194 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
L255193 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
L255192 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n.
L255170 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
L255169 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ She's gettin' prettier, Ma.
L255036 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Don't know--but it's better'n this.
L255035 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ What is it?
L255003 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I'd hate to get *trapped* in here.
L255002 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ It's jus' till we get some distance. Then you can come out.
L255001 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Comes night we'll get outa here.
L255000 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ That Casy. He might a been a preacher, but--he seen a lot a things clear. He was like a lantern--he helped mw see things too.
L254988 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I know I shouldn't. But okay.
L254987 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
L254986 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
L254985 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
L254984 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
L254983 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ They know he got hit in the face.
L254982 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ They know what--this fella looks like?
L254981 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.
L254980 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ They killed Casy first.
L254979 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
L254978 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
L254977 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Looks like you done it.
L254976 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear?
L254975 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ How's it feel, Tommy?
L254911 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Okay, Ma. Don't you worry.
L254910 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ You be careful, Tommy. Don't you be stickin' your nose in anything.
L254902 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Well, tomorra you'll get in a full day--full day's pay--an' we'll have plenty.
L254901 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I ain't full.
L254898 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.
L254897 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Got any more, Ma?
L254857 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ You know, I jus' can't remember when I felt so good before!
L254856 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
L254855 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Fust thing I'll get is coffee, cause ever'body been wantin' that, an' then some flour an' bakin' powder an' meat. Better not get no side- meat right off. Save that for later. Maybe Sat'dy. Got to get some soap too. An' milk. Rosasharn's got to have some milk.
L254836 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ What's that--detour?
L254835 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.
L254834 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
L254833 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ You promised, Tommy.
L254832 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency.
L254831 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.
L254830 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Ma, they comes a time when a man gets mad.
L254722 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ On a gallon a gas?  Let's set up the tent. Maybe I can fix us up some stew.
L254721 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ She shore don't look prosperous. Want to go somewheres else?
L254705 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. But I tol' Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'. I tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped.
L254704 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
L254703 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Since before they stopped us las' night.
L254702 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ When?
L254701 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Granma's dead.
L254700 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Was Granma bad?
L254699 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ No.
L254698 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Didn' you get no sleep?
L254697 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us. 
L254696 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Look, Ma!

L254498 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Forget it, Ma. Jus' think about the nice things out there. Think about them grapes and oranges--an' ever'body got work--
L254497 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
L254496 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.
L254495 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Your pa tol' me you didn't ought to cross it if you're paroled. Says they'll send you up again.
L254494 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Yes'm, that was it.
L254459 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ That's right. And douse some in it.
L254458 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
L254457 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Don't taste bad.
L254456 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Wait. There's a half a bottle a soothin' sirup here.  It put the chillun to sleep.
L254424 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ I'm ready.
L254423 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ How about it, Ma?
L254389 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son 
L254388 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
L254387 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?
L254386 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.
L254385 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Sometimes they do.
L254384 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Mad, Ma?
L254383 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy.  Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?
L254382 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Muley tol' me what happened, Ma. Are we goin' to California true?
L254381 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I'd a found you, Ma.
L254380 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ I was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again.

L254582 +++$+++ u5644 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ PA +++$+++ I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
L254581 +++$+++ u5641 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MAE +++$+++ You can have this for ten cents.
L254578 +++$+++ u5644 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ PA +++$+++ Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth?
L254577 +++$+++ u5641 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MAE +++$+++ This here's a fifteen-cent loaf.
L254572 +++$+++ u5641 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MAE +++$+++ You can't get no loaf a bread for a dime. We only got fifteen-cent loafs.
L254571 +++$+++ u5644 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ PA +++$+++ I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
L254570 +++$+++ u5641 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MAE +++$+++ Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.
L254569 +++$+++ u5644 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ PA +++$+++ I know, ma'am... on'y it's for a ole lady, no teeth, gotta sof'n it with water so she can chew it, an' she's hongry.

L254566 +++$+++ u5641 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MAE +++$+++ Yeah?
L254363 +++$+++ u5643 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MULEY +++$+++ I don't think so. One come out here once an' I clipped him from behin' with a fence stake. They ain't bothered since.
L254362 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Won't they come out here?
L254361 +++$+++ u5643 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MULEY +++$+++ All you got to do is lay down an' watch.
L254359 +++$+++ u5643 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MULEY +++$+++ You're *trespassin'*! It ain't you lan' no more! An' that's the supr'tendant--with a gun!
L254358 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
L254357 +++$+++ u5643 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MULEY +++$+++ Listen!  That's them! Them lights! Come on, we got to hide out!
L254348 +++$+++ u5643 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MULEY +++$+++ The rest of my fambly set out for the west--there wasn't nothin' to eat--but I couldn't leave. Somepin' wouldn't let me. So now I just wander around. Sleep wherever I am. I used to tell myself I was lookin' out for things, so when they come back ever'thing would be all right. But I knowed that wan't true. There ain't nothin' to look out for. And ain't nobody comin' back. They're gone-- and me, I'm just an 'ol graveyard ghost--that's all in the world I am.
L254347 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
L254346 +++$+++ u5643 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MULEY +++$+++ What was the use. He was right. There wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it.
L254327 +++$+++ u5643 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MULEY +++$+++ They come. They come and pushed me off.
L254326 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Well?
L254308 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ That's what I asked you, ain't it?
L254307 +++$+++ u5643 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MULEY +++$+++ Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?
L254306 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Are you crazy?
L254305 +++$+++ u5643 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MULEY +++$+++ Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
L254304 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ But who done it?
L254303 +++$+++ u5643 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MULEY +++$+++ Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
L254302 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ But what's happened?  How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place.
L254301 +++$+++ u5643 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MULEY +++$+++ Gone--  --over to your Uncle John's. The whole crowd of 'em, two weeks ago. But they can't stay there either, because John's got *his* notice to get off.
L254295 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I know that! But *where* they gone?
L254294 +++$+++ u5643 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MULEY +++$+++ They gone.
L254293 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
L254292 +++$+++ u5643 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MULEY +++$+++ Tommy?
L254325 +++$+++ u5643 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MULEY +++$+++ Well, I'm right here to tell you, mister, ain't *nobody* going to push me off *my* land! Grampa took up this land seventy years ago. My pa was born here. We was *all* born on it, and some of us got killed on it, and some died on it. And that's what makes it ourn--bein' born on it, and workin' it, and dyin' on it--and not no piece of paper with writin' on it! So just come on and try to push me off!
L254324 +++$+++ u5650 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ THE MAN +++$+++ Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
L254323 +++$+++ u5643 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MULEY +++$+++ Then who *do* we shoot?
L254318 +++$+++ u5650 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ THE MAN +++$+++ It ain't nobody. It's a company.
L254317 +++$+++ u5643 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MULEY +++$+++ Who's the Shawnee Land and Cattle Comp'ny?
L254314 +++$+++ u5650 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ THE MAN +++$+++ Now don't go blaming me. It ain't *my* fault.
L254313 +++$+++ u5643 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MULEY +++$+++ You mean get off my own land?
L254312 +++$+++ u5650 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ THE MAN +++$+++ I can't help that. All I know is I got my orders. They told me to tell you you got to get off, and that's what I'm telling you.
L254311 +++$+++ u5643 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MULEY +++$+++ But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now.  The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.
L254310 +++$+++ u5650 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ THE MAN +++$+++ Fact of the matter, Muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more. It don't even break even, much less show a profit. One man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. You just pay him a wage and take *all* the crop.
L255050 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You're tootin' we're gonna stay. 
L255049 +++$+++ u5644 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ PA +++$+++ We gonna stay, ain't we?
L255048 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Take 'er on down, Al. I'll sign.
L254905 +++$+++ u5644 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ PA +++$+++ No. I'm jus' gonna set awhile an' then go to bed.
L254904 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me?
L254903 +++$+++ u5644 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ PA +++$+++ You wouldn't think jus' reachin' up an' pickin'd get you in the back.
L254827 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Give 'im a fryin' pan. 
L254826 +++$+++ u5644 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ PA +++$+++ I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
L254825 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it.
L254637 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Me an' you both.
L254636 +++$+++ u5644 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ PA +++$+++ Ya know, you're the second fella talked like that. I'd like to hear some more about that.
L254622 +++$+++ u5644 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ PA +++$+++ I shore would like to stop here a while an' give her some res' but we on'y got 'bout forty dollars left. I won't feel right till we're there an' all workin' an' a little money comin' in.
L254621 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ She's jus' wore out, that's all.
L254618 +++$+++ u5644 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ PA +++$+++ How's Granma since we got her in the tent?
L254617 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Got that desert yet. Gotta take her tonight. Take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out.
L254486 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Casy, won't you say a few words?
L254485 +++$+++ u5644 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ PA +++$+++ Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
L254484 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I figger best we leave something like this on him, lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt.  Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one.
L254475 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ California, here we come!
L254474 +++$+++ u5644 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ PA +++$+++ Here we go!
L254455 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Ain't no whisky, is they?
L254454 +++$+++ u5644 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ PA +++$+++ Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self.  Reckon we could git him *drunk*?
L254453 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck, or somepin. He can't stay here.
L254420 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Easy. After all, they ain't but about *twelve* of us, is they?
L254419 +++$+++ u5644 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ PA +++$+++ Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.
L254418 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ How you get all this money?
L254405 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Why, she wasn't no more'n a kid when I went up.
L254404 +++$+++ u5644 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ PA +++$+++ That's Connie Rivers with her. They're married now.  She's due about three-four months.
L254542 +++$+++ u5648 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ SECOND MAN +++$+++ Look at 'em! Same yella han'bill-- 800 pickers wanted. Awright, this man wants 800 men. So he prints up 5,000 a them han'bills an' maybe 20,000 people sees 'em. An' maybe two-three thousan' starts movin, wes' account a this han'bill. Two- three thousan' folks that's crazy with worry headin' out for 800 jobs! Does that make sense?
L254541 +++$+++ u5644 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ PA +++$+++ But what does *that* prove?
L254538 +++$+++ u5648 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ SECOND MAN +++$+++ I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
