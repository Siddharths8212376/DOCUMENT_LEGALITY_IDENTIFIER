L469815 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ So where does that leave us, Mr. Welles? What kind of sad future are we two making? A future where men will do anything to sell their newspapers and their movies? A future where no price is too high for fame and power? When we will all scratch each other to pieces just to be heard?
L469814 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master.
L469813 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.
L469812 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Do you?
L469811 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
L469107 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'll remember that.
L469106 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
L469105 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ So I've been told.
L469104 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous business.
L469101 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ To make pictures.
L469100 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ I see. And you are in California for what reason?
L469099 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ And director.
L469098 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ The actor
L469097 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ My name is Orson Welles
L469096 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ Who are you, sir?
L469495 +++$+++ u2552 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MAYER +++$+++ Yeah
L469494 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ See what you can do about this CITIZEN KANE picture, won't you?
L469492 +++$+++ u2552 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MAYER +++$+++ Bel Air is restricted.
L469491 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ Why is that, Louis?
L469490 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ Oh, why is that?
L469489 +++$+++ u2552 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MAYER +++$+++ You know that can't happen.
L469488 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.
L469485 +++$+++ u2552 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MAYER +++$+++ Yeah
L469484 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
L469483 +++$+++ u2552 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MAYER +++$+++ Uh-hub.
L469482 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.
L469481 +++$+++ u2552 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MAYER +++$+++ Over at RKO?
L469480 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ Quite. And this is why I came to visit. Have you heard about this CITIZEN KANE picture?
L469478 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ Hope you don't mind my popping in--
L469477 +++$+++ u2552 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MAYER +++$+++ Randolph!
L469476 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ Louis
L469641 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ There is nothing to understand but this:   I am a man who could have been great, but was not.
L469640 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I don't want you to--
L469639 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
L469638 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
L469637 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I just want to understand--
L469636 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ I will not have this in my home.
L469635 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
L469634 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ You are slovenly and unattractive and I won't  t-t-t-tolerate it.
L469633 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
L469632 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ You are repellant when you drink.
L469631 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ You will not walk out on me
L469630 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.
L469629 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ But why? Just so you can show it all off -- just so everyone can see what a b-b-big man you are?!
L469628 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ Not for me.
L469627 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ There's a different between want and
L469626 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ I wanted it
L469625 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
L469624 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ You needn't use that language with me
L469623 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
L469622 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
L469621 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
L469620 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ You don't need it! That's the problem you always think you need everything--
L469619 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
L469618 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
L469617 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ There is nothing to discuss-
L469616 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ You gotta wake up now. Pops.
L469615 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ We are in no "pickle" -- as you would euphemistically have it.
L469614 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
L469613 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ I will not defend my life to you--
L469612 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
L469611 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ There's nothing to explain
L469610 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Then you explain it to me?!
L469570 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I am not that woman.
L469569 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ This picture--
L469568 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
L469567 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ Marion--
L469566 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore.
L469565 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Well -- he got us, didn't he? She stands and goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh
L469522 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ One . . . buys things.
L469521 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
L469520 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ Yes.
L469519 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ We're 125 million dollars in debt?
L469517 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ How much?
L469516 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ It's not really--
L469515 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ How much?
L469514 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ The S.E.C. has turned down my request for relief on the debts.
L469513 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Pops
L469512 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ Nothing for you to worry about, darling
L469511 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ How bad is it?
L469507 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Don't
L469506 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ He is a Bolshevik. He will have us at war by the end of the year. I think I'm going to run that wheelchair picture.
L469505 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all.
L469504 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt today.
L469298 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Nuts. She only cares about the money. She thinks I'll make you cut her out of the w-w-w-w...  will.
L469297 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.
L469296 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ There. That's right.
L469294 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ Darling, I talked to Millicent.
L469293 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ This is supposed ta be Siam or some such. Some kinda lousy B-B-Balinese temple. This look like a temple to you? I can't see it myself--

L469157 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ There's no call for that language-
L469156 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life!
L469468 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ Good. Retain that feeling. Let it nourish you from this day forth. It shall nourish us both
L469467 +++$+++ u2549 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ LOUELLA +++$+++ I want blood
L469466 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ And how do you feel when you are lied to?
L469465 +++$+++ u2549 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ LOUELLA +++$+++ He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
L469464 +++$+++ u2549 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ LOUELLA +++$+++ He lied to me
L469463 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ Please be quiet.

L469461 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
L469460 +++$+++ u2549 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ LOUELLA +++$+++ Sir?
L469459 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ Why did we not know about this sooner?
L469458 +++$+++ u2549 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ LOUELLA +++$+++ Sir? 
L469457 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ Miss Parsons, I have one additional question for you.
L469456 +++$+++ u2549 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ LOUELLA +++$+++ Thank you, sir. She begins to leave
L469455 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ Thank you for your time
L469453 +++$+++ u2549 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ LOUELLA +++$+++ The drinking.
L469452 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ Yes?
L469451 +++$+++ u2549 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ LOUELLA +++$+++ The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And...
L469450 +++$+++ u2547 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ HEARST +++$+++ How so?
L469449 +++$+++ u2549 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ LOUELLA +++$+++ It's all you. It has the political campaigns and the mining fortune and the war with Pulitzer and the castle. And ... Marion.

I've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it? All right, if that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice. It's obvious the people prefer Jim Gettys to me."
L469263 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I am not doing Hearst.
L469262 +++$+++ u2549 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ LOUELLA +++$+++ Orson, hold on. Look into my eyes. Tell me you are not doing Hearst.
L469261 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ That's right. A symphony of those: vaunted and valued tellers-of-truth. Those heroic minutemen standing sentry on our liberties--
L469260 +++$+++ u2549 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ LOUELLA +++$+++ A delicious amalgamation, is it?
L469259 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
L469258 +++$+++ u2549 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ LOUELLA +++$+++ You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
L469257 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ We're using-
L469256 +++$+++ u2549 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ LOUELLA +++$+++ Now, Orson, you know I'm just dyin' to see your picture and I know it's gonna be boffo, but you're writing about a publisher, right?

L469245 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?
L469503 +++$+++ u2549 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ LOUELLA +++$+++ You are talking to him.
L469502 +++$+++ u2554 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ Can I talk to Hearst?
L469501 +++$+++ u2549 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ LOUELLA +++$+++ And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
L469500 +++$+++ u2554 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ Oh for God's sake, Louella-
L469499 +++$+++ u2549 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ LOUELLA +++$+++ Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
L469498 +++$+++ u2554 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
L469497 +++$+++ u2549 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ LOUELLA +++$+++ That's right, fella, no Hearst paper will run an RKO ad until you agree that CITIZEN KANE will never see the light of day.
L469443 +++$+++ u2549 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ LOUELLA +++$+++ Uh-huh
L469442 +++$+++ u2554 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ Hearst?
L469441 +++$+++ u2549 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ LOUELLA +++$+++ That's right
L469440 +++$+++ u2554 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ He personally asked you to?
L469439 +++$+++ u2549 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ LOUELLA +++$+++ Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me to see the picture today.
L469438 +++$+++ u2554 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
L469437 +++$+++ u2549 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ LOUELLA +++$+++ I wanna see the picture today
L469436 +++$+++ u2554 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ No -- no -- I mean--

L469843 +++$+++ u2550 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MANK +++$+++ Yeah, you're probably right.
L469842 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
L469838 +++$+++ u2550 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MANK +++$+++ Aw, cheer up, George'll probably be running Fox by the morning. Let's get a drink.
L469837 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What have I done?
L469835 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ George...
L469834 +++$+++ u2550 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MANK +++$+++ Shit
L469826 +++$+++ u2550 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MANK +++$+++ Face it, Orson, they're gonna hate it. I told you, not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch of New York actors.
L469825 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Mank!
L469824 +++$+++ u2550 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MANK +++$+++ Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
L469823 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You gonna watch?
L469793 +++$+++ u2550 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MANK +++$+++ This ain't George's doing--!
L469792 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ YOU STUPID, LITTLE MAN! HOW COULD YOU HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN?! I GAVE YOU MY SOUL AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO SELL IT!?
L469777 +++$+++ u2550 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MANK +++$+++ Kinda.
L469776 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Is that from one of the Gospels?
L469557 +++$+++ u2550 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MANK +++$+++ I told you this was going to happen! I told you he was going to come after us! So we took the chance anyway and we lost. That's how it goes, okay? I got my check, kid, and so did you -- and that's what it's all about -- so fuck it and move on.
L469556 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
L469555 +++$+++ u2550 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MANK +++$+++ They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
L469554 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It's too late. The movie's made
L469553 +++$+++ u2550 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MANK +++$+++ If he had known about KANE before you made it, you'd be dead already.
L469551 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!

L469548 +++$+++ u2550 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MANK +++$+++ Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0.
