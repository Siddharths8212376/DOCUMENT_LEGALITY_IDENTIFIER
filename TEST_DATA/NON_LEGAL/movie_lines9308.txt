L424087 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ I know that...
L424086 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Come on, Elden, think about it. The driver, all them trunks standing open like that... something's going on here!
L423867 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ She said she was in Arizona, did she?
L423866 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
L423863 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.
L423862 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
L423860 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Tell him what you told me.
L423859 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
L423858 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on...
L423855 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?
L423854 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ We think we know where Betty is.
L423853 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
L423728 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
L423727 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
L423726 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
L423725 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ You're lying!
L423724 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
L423723 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!
L423655 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ That's right, you have the right to remain silent.
L423654 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ One question, Doctor, please!  You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
L423653 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
L423652 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Oww, the arm, the arm!
L423651 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
L423650 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
L423644 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ 'S just a theory... just 'cause I'm thinking it don't mean I like it.
L423643 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
L423642 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ A woman can write a check.
L423641 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ You said a woman couldn't have done it.
L423640 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
L423639 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Anyway, so what?
L423638 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Junior year!
L423637 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ ...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
L423636 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
L423635 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Yeah?
L423634 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ I questioned Joyce about all this...
L423614 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ You better handle what's in this garbage can first.
L423613 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
L423612 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Bad idea...
L423611 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
L423610 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Did you send anyone out there?
L423609 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
L423608 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
L423606 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ You think a woman did that?!
L423605 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Jesus...
L423604 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ I'm tellin' you it wasn't no woman, Roy!
L423603 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
L423602 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ It wasn't a woman.
L423601 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
L423600 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's...
L423599 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ No, Elden, I need to...
L423598 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ ...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
L423597 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
L423596 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
L423595 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
L423594 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
L423593 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Oww! My arm, careful!
L423592 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the record yet.
L423354 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Mind your own business. You just said that shit so you could look at her a little longer, anyway...
L423353 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
L423352 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ ...plenty
L423351 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
L423350 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Why you always gotta embarrass me? I been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me!
L423348 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty.
L423347 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ You should get the order you want.
L423346 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ It's fine. Mind your own meal...
L423345 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I thought you said the eggs weren't...
L423340 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Why don't you go back to doing something you're good at... like that Lonelyhearts column?  I'll take a refill there, Betty...
L423339 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
L423338 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole idea of "church bake sales" in perspective...
L423413 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ Uh-huh.  Anyway, I'm thinking Easter, 'cause I just fucking love pastels.
L423412 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ 'Kay, good. Bye, then...
L423411 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
L423410 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
L423409 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ You must be joking.
L423408 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ They're fine... you miss it?
L423407 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
L423406 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Oh. How come?
L423405 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ Great. Good. Content...
L423404 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No, I was just... How you doing?
L423403 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ Need something else?
L423401 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ You know, flags and shit... he said "for a livelier look" or something.
L423400 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ "Banners?"
L423399 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ Uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet... well, once he dumps her we will.  He's out pricing banners... I don't expect him back.
L424570 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I don't think I am.
L424569 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
L424568 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
L424567 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
L424566 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
L424565 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
L424564 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ When a Roman general knew a battle was lost, he'd throw himself on his sword.
L424563 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ ...what're you saying?
L424562 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
L424561 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'd rather not...
L424560 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Ahh, it's too late, anyway. It's too late.  Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with me... If you'd gimme my gun back.
L424559 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ This is really awkward...
L424558 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
L424557 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I better go check on them.
L424556 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
L424544 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
L424543 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
L424542 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L424541 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That's my son! My son is dead!
L424528 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
L424527 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
L424526 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
L424525 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
L424524 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No one is, honey. Here, listen to this... "If who I am and who I hope to be should meet one day, I know they will be friends." Now that's beautiful.
L424523 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
L424522 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
L424521 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ "Thirty-two?"
L424520 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
L424519 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Umm, I don't think that...
L424518 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
L424517 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Sure. You could probably have any thing you wanted... somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself, and you don't even realize it.
L424516 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I am?
L424515 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different.
L424496 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...to see you.
L424495 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ ...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
L424494 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Damn, life is strange. I had you figured for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch -- Not that I didn't admire you for it.
L424493 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
L424492 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
L424491 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
L424490 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
L424489 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...
L424488 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Do you know why I'm here?
L424487 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ ...I... I know what you are.
L424486 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Do you know who I am?
L424485 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
L424484 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ ...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
L424477 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Oh, this is wonderful...
L424476 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
L424475 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Who are these idiots?
L423945 +++$+++ u2372 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHIEF NURSE +++$+++ Alright. Oh, and one more thing about what you did yesterday... Well done.
L423944 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Umm... yes. Back home.
L423943 +++$+++ u2372 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHIEF NURSE +++$+++ You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone.  Is that issue?
L423942 +++$+++ u2372 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHIEF NURSE +++$+++ Good. I'm prepared to offer you a job. You can help out in the pharmacy until your California certification and references arrive, but you are not to touch anyone. Is that totally clear?  Fine...
L423941 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.
L423940 +++$+++ u2372 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHIEF NURSE +++$+++ What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?
L423898 +++$+++ u2372 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHIEF NURSE +++$+++ Really? You've just described all of Southern California.
L423897 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
L423896 +++$+++ u2372 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHIEF NURSE +++$+++ ...I don't think I know that hospital.
L423895 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
L423894 +++$+++ u2372 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHIEF NURSE +++$+++ Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
L423893 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
L423892 +++$+++ u2372 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHIEF NURSE +++$+++ Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...
L423794 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
L423793 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I gotta go.
L423792 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ Do what?
L423791 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.
L423790 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L423789 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
L423788 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
L423787 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ Halfway where? You've gotta come home. We've been worried sick about you. Are you alright?
L423669 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
L423668 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
L423667 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?
L423666 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ Well, you are.
L423665 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ All the time...
L423664 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
L423663 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
L423662 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
L423661 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Are you and Larry happy?
L423660 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ Let me know if you need anything, okay?
