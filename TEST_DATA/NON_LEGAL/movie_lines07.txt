L3547 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Traitor!!
L3378 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ You think you are a director?  You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate you.
L3377 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ No, I don't get that!
L3376 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ You got that?
L3375 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
L3374 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
L3373 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Credit?
L3372 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
L3370 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.
L3369 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
L3368 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
L3366 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Be quiet.  Watch.
L3365 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
L3364 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Bad last moment - I cut it out.
L3363 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
L3362 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Shut up.  Look!
L3361 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ I'm serious.
L3360 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
L3359 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
L3357 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
L3356 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
L3251 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Cut!
L3250 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
L3247 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Good idea!
L3246 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!
L3193 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.
L3192 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Sit down!
L3191 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Let me get a shot of it.
L3190 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ What does it look like?  It's an address book!
L3189 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ What is that?
L3188 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Put the camera down, Oleg.
L3187 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Why not?
L3186 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
L3185 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ I did.
L3184 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
L3183 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ What is it?
L3088 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Don't want to film this?
L3087 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
L3085 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Does it hurt?
L3084 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Shut up.
L3083 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
L2844 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
L2843 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
L2842 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Get in the bathroom!
L2790 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
L2789 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Whore?
L2783 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
L2782 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ How you erase this?
L2781 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ You said speak Czech!
L2780 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Speak English!
L2779 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
L2778 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Turn that fucking thing off!
L2671 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
L2670 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ What?
L2668 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so.  Unless you refuse, Oleg.
L2667 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
L2666 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Turn that off!  Get the bags.
L2640 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ We have no money.  Come on.
L2639 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
L2638 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
L2637 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
L2636 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Don't speak Russian!
L2635 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
L2562 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ I want to document my trip to America.
L2561 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Did you hear what I said?
L2560 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Okay.
L2559 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Don't fool around.
L2558 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Okay.
L2557 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
L2692 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?
L2691 +++$+++ u39 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MILOS +++$+++ We started over, you can too.
L2690 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
L2689 +++$+++ u39 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MILOS +++$+++ It's easy to learn.
L2688 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ As a plumber?!
L2687 +++$+++ u39 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MILOS +++$+++ Yes, the money is good.
L2686 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ A job?
L2685 +++$+++ u39 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MILOS +++$+++ I can get you a job.
L2682 +++$+++ u39 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MILOS +++$+++ Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?!
L2681 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Ha. Ha.
L2680 +++$+++ u39 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MILOS +++$+++ We spent it!
L2679 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Milos.  Get my money!
L2678 +++$+++ u39 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MILOS +++$+++ Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
L2676 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
L2675 +++$+++ u39 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MILOS +++$+++ Did you hurt her?
L2674 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
L2673 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Surprise!  Surprise!
L2672 +++$+++ u39 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MILOS +++$+++ Emil???!
L3353 +++$+++ u37 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You want the tape?  There it is!
L3352 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ Viewer discretion advised!
L3275 +++$+++ u37 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Trust me, you'll want to take this call.
L3274 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
L3273 +++$+++ u37 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You've got a call.
L3272 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L3271 +++$+++ u37 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Robert...?
L3413 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Don't give me that fucking shit.
L3412 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
L3411 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
L3410 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
L3409 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ And you, you'll pay for what you did!
L2615 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ Paulie, you've got kids, right?
L2614 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yeah?
L2610 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ In love?  With who?
L2609 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
L2608 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ Isn't he a little moody?
L3269 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
L3268 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
L3267 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Alright.  Go ahead.
L3266 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ I'm trying to tell you.
L3265 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ I want to hear everything he said.
L3264 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ Well, he...
L3263 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
L3262 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ I know.
L2591 +++$+++ u33 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ IMMIGRATION OFFICER +++$+++ Excuse me?
L2590 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
L2589 +++$+++ u33 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ IMMIGRATION OFFICER +++$+++ Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
L2588 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ I'm here for movies.
L2587 +++$+++ u33 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ IMMIGRATION OFFICER +++$+++ What are you coming here to do?
L2586 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ A cheap hotel.
L2585 +++$+++ u33 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ IMMIGRATION OFFICER +++$+++ Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
L2584 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ New York.
L2583 +++$+++ u33 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ IMMIGRATION OFFICER +++$+++ Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
L2582 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ I speak English.
L2576 +++$+++ u33 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ IMMIGRATION OFFICER +++$+++ Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
L2575 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Yes...he's my friend.
L3403 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
L3402 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Well, he killed my partner!
L3401 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ He's my collar!
L3400 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
L3399 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ No way!  He's mine!
L3398 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I'll take him.
L2745 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Evidence.  Of a homicide.
L2744 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ What was that?
L2743 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
L2742 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
L2741 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ That's what it looks like to me.
L2740 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
L2733 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Thanks.  Appreciate it.
L2732 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ No.  Go ahead.
L2773 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here.
L2772 +++$+++ u40 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MUGGER +++$+++ A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
L2771 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ You okay?
L2707 +++$+++ u40 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MUGGER +++$+++ Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
L2706 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I'll send a cop back for you.
L2703 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Oh yeah?  Guess again.
L2702 +++$+++ u40 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MUGGER +++$+++ Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
L2701 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?
L2700 +++$+++ u40 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MUGGER +++$+++ Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
L2699 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
L2698 +++$+++ u40 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MUGGER +++$+++ Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
L2813 +++$+++ u38 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
L2812 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Yeah?  What kind?
L2811 +++$+++ u38 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I used an accelerant.
L2810 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ How did you start the fire this time?
L2809 +++$+++ u38 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
L2808 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
L3344 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!
L3343 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ What the hell happened?
L3342 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Get outta here!
L3288 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Not good.
L3287 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ How was it?
L3026 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby.
L3025 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
L3024 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!
L2872 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
L2871 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ Aren't you tired?
L2870 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
L2865 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ You hear that question, Garcia?
L2864 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ How long they been livin' here?
L2863 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ -- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.
L2795 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Maybe you can be his stand-in.
L2794 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ Yeah?
L2793 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
L2768 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
L2767 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ What?
L2757 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
L2756 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ What??
L2755 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ He knew all along.
L2754 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
L2739 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ But you knew that, right?
L2738 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.
L2737 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Don't blow your nose!
L2736 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ Clean?
L2735 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Mouth's clean, too.
L2725 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
L2724 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
L2721 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ 'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
L2720 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Oh yeah, why?
L2719 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
L2718 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
L2717 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
L2716 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
L2715 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
L3427 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!
L3426 +++$+++ u47 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
L3425 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
L3424 +++$+++ u47 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Don't stoop to his level!
L3423 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
L3422 +++$+++ u47 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ What are you gonna do?
L2930 +++$+++ u47 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ The clerk?
L2929 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
