L388159 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims.
L388152 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Why not?
L388151 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ That simple, huh?
L388150 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules.  In the myth, Bellerophon killed Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world.  I think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon.
L388104 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ The satellite doesn't work as fast as I do.
L388103 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual.  The visuals aren't coming up.
L388102 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ It's the transponder.
L388322 +++$+++ u6625 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NEKHORVICH +++$+++ You know, I think it's a little late for that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.
L388321 +++$+++ u6624 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ MCCLOY +++$+++ Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
L388320 +++$+++ u6625 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NEKHORVICH +++$+++ You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.
L388319 +++$+++ u6624 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ MCCLOY +++$+++ You still don't get it, do you?  You want to make an omelet, you break a few eggs - <i>I needed to know just how bad the disease was</i> - in the real world, not the lab.  And you never know til you try.  You thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas.  But I saw you creating a disease so terrible in <i>Chimera</i> that the cure would be priceless.
L388318 +++$+++ u6625 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NEKHORVICH +++$+++ By asking me.
L388317 +++$+++ u6624 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ MCCLOY +++$+++ Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
L388316 +++$+++ u6625 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NEKHORVICH +++$+++ 'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with <i>Chimera</i> needed it as well.
L388315 +++$+++ u6624 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ MCCLOY +++$+++ You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
L388314 +++$+++ u6625 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NEKHORVICH +++$+++ Do I?
L388313 +++$+++ u6624 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ MCCLOY +++$+++ You have Bellerophon.
L388298 +++$+++ u6625 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NEKHORVICH +++$+++ You are infected with <i>Chimera,</i> my friend.
L388297 +++$+++ u6624 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ MCCLOY +++$+++ It was in the bloody papers, on the telly..what's this about Gradski?
L388296 +++$+++ u6625 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NEKHORVICH +++$+++ Fatigued, certainly.  But dead is a little extreme.  On the other hand, when me dear Gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live.
L388295 +++$+++ u6624 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ MCCLOY +++$+++ What's happening here?  You're dead!
L388294 +++$+++ u6625 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NEKHORVICH +++$+++ A visit from an old friend.
L388613 +++$+++ u6636 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KASIMOV +++$+++ Yes, Anatoly, yes.
L388612 +++$+++ u6630 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ANATOLY +++$+++ To friends.
L388609 +++$+++ u6630 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ANATOLY +++$+++ Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev...
L388608 +++$+++ u6636 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KASIMOV +++$+++ His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
L388607 +++$+++ u6630 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ANATOLY +++$+++ Come on!
L388603 +++$+++ u6636 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KASIMOV +++$+++ You're right, of course.
L388602 +++$+++ u6630 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ANATOLY +++$+++ You asked for my help.  You <u>asked</u> for <u>my</u> help...come on...
L388601 +++$+++ u6636 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KASIMOV +++$+++ They'll kill me.
L388600 +++$+++ u6630 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ANATOLY +++$+++ C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
L388595 +++$+++ u6636 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KASIMOV +++$+++ I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
L388594 +++$+++ u6630 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ANATOLY +++$+++ Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
L389160 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ Good idea.
L389159 +++$+++ u6631 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ BARNES +++$+++ Maybe we donít have to know what he looks like.  If heís got that list, heís going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops.
L389158 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ This is bullshit - we donít even know what Max looks like.
L389157 +++$+++ u6631 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ BARNES +++$+++ Nothing but civilians, Gene.
L389143 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ I donít know.  It didnít say on the tickets.
L389142 +++$+++ u6631 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ BARNES +++$+++ What kind of show.
L389141 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ Heís putting on a show, Barnes.
L389140 +++$+++ u6631 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ BARNES +++$+++ But why tell us?
L389139 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.
L389138 +++$+++ u6631 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ BARNES +++$+++ Whatís Hunt doing on the TGV?
L389137 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ And if we donít find him - weíll search the whole train again.
L389136 +++$+++ u6631 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ BARNES +++$+++ Only four more cars.
L389024 +++$+++ u6631 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ BARNES +++$+++ What about him...?
L389023 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.
L389018 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ Okay!
L389017 +++$+++ u6631 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ BARNES +++$+++ Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!
L389016 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ <u>Think</u>, for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face!  What does Ethan Hunt <u>want</u>?!
L388983 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ S.O.P..
L388982 +++$+++ u6631 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ BARNES +++$+++ That's S.O.P..
L388920 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ Let's not waste time chasing him.  Make him come to us.  Everybodyís got pressure points.  Find out something that's important to him personally and you squeeze.
L388919 +++$+++ u6631 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ BARNES +++$+++ So what do you suggest?
L388918 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
L388917 +++$+++ u6631 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ BARNES +++$+++ Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.
L388916 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ The man's gone black, Barnes.  He's under until he decides to surface.
L389201 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Yes.
L389200 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ Now we donít have to eliminate him?  You like that, donít you Claire?  Donít you?
L389199 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Donít Jim.
L389192 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ Fold it.  Fold it tight.
L389191 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ All ten million.
L389190 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ Satisfied?
L389183 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
L389182 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
L389179 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ Why the masquerade?  Why take the risk? Well, Claire, youíve asked the question and you are the answer.
L389178 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
L389177 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ Two minutes til Krieger shows.  Thisíll have to be quicker than Iíd like. Certainly quicker than youíd like.
L389174 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
L389173 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You knew about Jim?
L389032 +++$+++ u6638 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KRIEGER +++$+++ Stay out of this. OR Lachez - moi OR T'agueue
L389031 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Krieger.
L389030 +++$+++ u6638 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KRIEGER +++$+++ I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.
L388949 +++$+++ u6638 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KRIEGER +++$+++ May take a little time.
L388948 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Krieger can get it.  Right?
L388937 +++$+++ u6638 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KRIEGER +++$+++ If we're going to Virginia, why don't we drop by Fort Knox?  I can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than breaking into the God damn CIA.
L388936 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Always.
L388935 +++$+++ u6638 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KRIEGER +++$+++ Is he serious?
L389208 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I always have, Claire..
L389207 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me back...wonít you...
L389206 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Claire.
L389205 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ This stuff is so sticky.
L389204 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Claire...Hey...
L389171 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Ethan?
L389170 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Of course - Iím sorry to hear you say that Claire.
L389169 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Ethanís right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.
L389147 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
L389146 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Two cars.  Where are you?
L389145 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
L389144 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
L389122 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Yes.......come here....viens pres moi...
L389121 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Is this the only way?
L389120 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Okay...
L389119 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I sent the message to Max.  Weíre on for tomorrow.
L389118 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What happened?
L389067 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ He's expecting my call.  I'm going to the station...  And I'm going to call him.
L389066 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L389064 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Bastard!
L389063 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Kittridge...
L389045 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'm going to try and get some sleep.
L389044 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ We did what we had to do.
L389043 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'm so sorry.  Krieger was my call.  I've never worked with him.  I'm sorry, Ethan.
L388971 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ What about me - Jim called an abort - I didn't comply.  I lost the team. I just need you to be safe.
L388970 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What about you?
L388969 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I just need you to be safe.
L388968 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You didn't have to.........
L388967 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I didn't say that.
L388966 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You don't think we're going to make it.
L388965 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away.
L388964 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Sure...
L388963 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ May I come in?
L388927 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What kind of help?
L388926 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
L388925 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
L388924 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You're sure about this?
L388923 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
L388922 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
L388921 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Max made a deal with you?
L388856 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I'm going to answer it.
L388855 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ The message is for Job.
L388854 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.
L388853 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
L388852 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.
L388851 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L388850 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I've been disavowed.  They think I killed Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list.
L388849 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Why haven't they brought us in yet?
L388848 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!
L388847 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Who sent you?!  Who sent you?
L388846 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Who is they, who is they?
L388845 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Did they send you...Did they send you?
L388844 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Who is "they?"
L388843 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
L388842 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
L388841 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Where were you?
L388840 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Take off your God damn coat!
L388839 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What?
L388838 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Take off your coat.
L388837 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ They're dead.  Jim's dead.
L388835 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What happened to Jim?
L388834 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ There was nobody on the bridge.
L388833 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What happened to Jim?
L388832 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
L388831 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.
L388830 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the car.
L388829 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...
L388828 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You were in the car!
L388827 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Don't move.
L388826 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you?
L388734 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Roger that.
L388733 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport in five minutes.
L388625 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Oh yeah?
L388624 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
L388623 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?
L388622 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Sleeping's better.
L388621 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Talking's good, walking's better.
L388620 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'm walking.
L388619 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
L388618 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
L388617 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ We got it.  On your feet.
L388616 +++$+++ u6632 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Did we get it?
L389078 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
L389077 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
L389076 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ Certainly Ethan.
L389075 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
L389070 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ It's Hunt.  What do you need for a pinpoint?  Been watching a little T.V., have you?
L389069 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I see you've been out visiting the folks.
L389068 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ Kittridge.
L388817 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset.
L388816 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
L388815 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.
L388814 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ Since your father's death, your family's farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, suddenly, they're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank. Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in America after all, can be a very expensive proposition Ethan.  So, why don't we go quietly out of here onto the plane...
L388812 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ Yes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like you said.  You survived.
L388811 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ This whole operation was a molehunt.
L388810 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ Correct the actual list is safe at Langley.  "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours.
L388809 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
L388808 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
L388807 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ The arms dealer.
L388806 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ For a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations.  We have a penetration.  The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as "Max."
L388805 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ You're right.  Maybe this'll save some time.
L388804 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
L388803 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ I don't quite follow you.
L388802 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
L388801 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ What?
L388800 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Why was there another team?
L388799 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ Yes.  I see your point.
L388798 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Who else is left?
L388797 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan.
L388796 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
L388795 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ We've lost enough agents for one night.
L388794 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Yeah.  I follow you.
L388793 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?
L388792 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Yeah.
L388791 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally.
L388790 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ One hour.
L388789 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ No sir.
L388788 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Donít disappoint me.
L388787 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Youíre in Prague?
L388786 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ Location green.  One hour.  Iíll be there myself.
L388785 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Yes.
L388784 +++$+++ u6637 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ KITTRIDGE +++$+++ Donít <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
