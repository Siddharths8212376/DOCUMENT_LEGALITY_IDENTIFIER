L28588 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
L28587 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
L28586 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ After you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper.
L28583 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ I am somebody.
L28582 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
L28581 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ It needn't be.
L28580 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow.
L28579 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will?
L28578 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
L28577 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...
L28576 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Please do.
L28575 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
L28574 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
L28573 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ You're more than modest.
L28572 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ You're more than kind. But it's still Miss Channing's performance. I'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original...
L28571 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ Of course your performance was no surprise to me. After the other day I regarded it as no more than - a promised fulfilled.
L28570 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I consider myself lucky they didn't throw things.
L28569 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ I expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet...
L28568 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
L28567 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ May I come in?
L28338 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
L28337 +++$+++ u3608 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MISS CASWELL +++$+++ Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
L28336 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ You next move, it seems to me, should be toward television.
L28335 +++$+++ u3608 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MISS CASWELL +++$+++ Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
L28334 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ Feeling better, my dear?
L28222 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ Because that is what they are. Go make him happy.
L28221 +++$+++ u3608 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MISS CASWELL +++$+++ Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
L28220 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ Claudia dear, come closer.  This is Max Fabian. He is a producer. Go do yourself some good.
L28212 +++$+++ u3608 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MISS CASWELL +++$+++ That's how you met me. In passing.
L28211 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ This must be, at long last, our formal introduction. Until now we have met only in passing...
L28208 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts.  Ah... Eve.
L28207 +++$+++ u3608 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MISS CASWELL +++$+++ We never met. That's why.
L28118 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ You have me confused with Dan Dailey. You go sit by the piano.  And you come sit by me.  Good night.
L28117 +++$+++ u3608 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MISS CASWELL +++$+++ Let's go sit by the piano.
L28070 +++$+++ u3608 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MISS CASWELL +++$+++ I don't want to make trouble. All I want is a drink.
L28069 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
L28068 +++$+++ u3608 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MISS CASWELL +++$+++ Well, I can't yell "Oh, butler," can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler...
L28067 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ That isn't a waiter, my dear. That's a butler.
L28050 +++$+++ u3608 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MISS CASWELL +++$+++ Now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for.
L28049 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ Every now and then, some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings.
L28980 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ As soon as the peasants stop pawing her.
L28979 +++$+++ u3607 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm giving her a very high-class party. It ain't like a rehearsal, she don't have to be late.
L28116 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ And too many of them are produced.
L28115 +++$+++ u3607 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays.
L28062 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ We all have abnormality in common. We are a breed apart from the rest of the humanity, we Theater folk. We are the original displaced personalities...
L28061 +++$+++ u3607 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ This answer satisfies me a hundred percent.
L28060 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
L28059 +++$+++ u3607 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Answer me this. What makes a man become a producer?
L28056 +++$+++ u3607 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Gable. Why a feller like that don't come East to do a play...
L28055 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool. By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children-
L28622 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ She may be later than you think...
L28621 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
L28620 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ Margo? Lunching in public?
L28619 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Margo.
L28618 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ From the smartness of your dress, I take it your luncheon companion is a lady?
L28613 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ A happy coincidence.
L28612 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You were there? At the play - last night?
L28611 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ I was there. An eyewitness.
L28610 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Then you've heard too.
L28609 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ She was magnificent.
L28094 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ Hear, hear...
L28093 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Then stop being a star - start treating your guests as your supporting cast!
L28333 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ To the best of my recollection, neither your name nor your performance entered the conversation.
L28332 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
L28331 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ Eve was incredibly modest. She insisted that no credit was due her, that Lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them.
L28330 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ How nice for Lloyd. And how nice for Eve. How nice for everybody.
L28329 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was beside himself. He listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning...
L28328 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
L28327 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ In time she'll be what you are.
L28326 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ How nice.
L28325 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire...
L28324 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I take it she read well.
L28323 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ Margo, as you know, i have lived in the Theater as a Trappist monk lives in his faith. I have no other world, no other life - and once in a great while I experience that moment of Revelation for which all true believers wait and pray. You were one. Jeanne Eagels another... Paula Wessely... Hayes - there are others, three or four. Eve Harrington will be among them...
L28322 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Was she that bad?
L28321 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.
L28320 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Just slipped your mind.
L28319 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ Frankly, I don't remember.
L28318 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ How... how was Miss Caswell?
L28317 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ It just slipped your mind.
L28316 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Of course I knew.
L28315 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ Didn't you know?
L28314 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Eve! My understudy...
L28313 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington.
L28312 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
L28311 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ Naturally enough, your understudy.
L28310 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
L28309 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.
L28308 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max.
L28307 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ Miss Caswell got lucky too late. The audition is over.
L28306 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ It's good luck before an audition. She'll be all right once it starts.
L28305 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ Being violently ill to her tummy.
L28304 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
L28303 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
L28302 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...
L28224 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Amen.
L28223 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ You mustn't worry about your little charge. She is in safe hands.
L28217 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Then you two must have a long talk-
L28216 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ We have that in common.
L28215 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-
L28214 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
L28213 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Eve, this is an old friend of Mr. deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington...  Addison, I've been wanting you to meet Eve for the longest time-
L28206 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I do not. How do you do?
L28205 +++$+++ u3599 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ ADDISON +++$+++ Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
L28204 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?
L28827 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Everything... everything's so funny...
L28826 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Nothing?
L28693 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten-  - and you're going to be on time.
L28692 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ When? When are you going to do it?
L28634 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Maybe just a little around the edges.
L28633 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I guess at this point I'm what the French call 'de trop'...
L28199 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ We know you, we've seen you before like this. Is it over - or just beginning?
L28198 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Macbeth.
L27813 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.
L27812 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Good luck, genius...
L27799 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ That's nice.
L27798 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Right here. A minute ago.
L27797 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Where?
L27796 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You've already met.
L27791 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ This is Eve Harrington.
L27790 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Huh?
L27789 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Bill!
L27785 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Bill-
L27784 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
L27783 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Bill...
L28815 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ A foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady... that's for me. And no more make believe! Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd.  I mean it, now. Grown-up women only, I might even play a mother - only one child, of course, not over eight...  Lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me?
L28814 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Often enough to keep the franchise.
L28811 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I'm going to have a home. Not just a house I'm afraid to stay in... and a man to go with it. I'll look up at six o'clock - and there he'll be... remember, Karen?
L28810 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ With the paper to prove it.
L28809 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ A married lady.
L28808 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ A cowboy.
L28807 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You know what I'm going to be?
L28806 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Yes, dear.
L28805 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Groom.
L28804 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Never try to outguess Margo.
L28800 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You know why I forgive Eve? Because she's left good behind - the four of us, together like this, it's Eve's fault - I forgive her...
L28799 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ You've got it backwards. Even for Wilkes-Barre.
L28798 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little Miss Evil. But the evil that men do - how does it go, groom? Something about the good they leave behind - I played it once in rep in Wilkes Barre...
L28797 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I want everybody to shut up about Eve. Just shut up about Eve, that's all I want. Give Karen more wine...  ... never have I been so happy. Isn't this a lovely room? The Cub Room. What a lovely, clever name. Where the elite meet. Never have I seen so much elite - and all with their eyes on me. Waiting for me to crack that little gnome over the noggin with a bottle. But not tonight. Even Eve. I forgive Eve... there they go.
L28796 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ What would you like? Texas?
L28795 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
L28711 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Pass me the empty bottle. I may find her... why, look. There's Rasputin.
L28710 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I understand she is now the understudy in there.
L28709 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ "Please forgive me for butting into what seems such a happy occasion - but it's most important that I speak with you. Please" - it's underlined - "meet me in the Ladies' Room. Eve."
L28701 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ The point is - in the cathedral, a ball park or a penny arcade - we want to have you two beside us our nearest and dearest friends.
L28700 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Something simple. A fur coat over a nightgown...
L28697 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all.
L28696 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ It's only for the license. There's a three-day wait - blood tests, things like that...
L28688 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Glory Hallelujah.
L28687 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ To Margo. To my bride-to-be.
L28681 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ You were great.
L28680 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ He does not exaggerate. I was good.
L28679 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ But you may quote me as follows. Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play, the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. Unquote.
L28678 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Hear, hear...
L28677 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ The so-called art of acting is not one for which I have a particularly high regard...
L28446 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ That suddenly makes the whole thing believable.
L28445 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Bill...  ... where are you going? To find Eve?
L28444 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I think you do know but you won't or can't tell me.  I said before it was going to be my last try, and I meant it. I can't think of anything else to do. I wish I could.  We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. Then it comes up again and everything's fine. But not this time.  You know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye, Margo.
L28443 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...
L28442 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what's behind all this.
L28441 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
L28440 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Then what would be enough?  If we were married?
L28439 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I wish it were.
L28438 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
L28437 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ It's not nonsense.
L28436 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
L28435 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
L28434 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Margo, let's make peace.
L28433 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
L28432 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
L28431 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Don't be condescending.
L28430 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I'll say.
L28429 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Well, I am.
L28428 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I've been aware of that for some time.
L28427 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ It's obvious you're not a woman.
L28426 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ It's time you found out. I love you.  I love you. You're a beautiful and intelligent woman-  - a beautiful and intelligent woman and a great actress-  - at the peak of her career. You have every reason for happiness-  - every reason, but due to some strange, uncontrollable, unconscious drive you permit the slightest action of a kid-  - kid like Eve to turn you into a hysterical, screaming harpy! Now once and for all, stop it!
L28425 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ That word again! I don't even know what it means...
L28424 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ No, I'll tell it to you! For the last time, I'll tell it to you. Because you've got to stop hurting yourself, and me, and the two of us by these paranoiac tantrums!
L28423 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Tell that to Dr. Freud! Along with the rest of it...
L28422 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
L28421 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Paranoiac!
L28420 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts!
L28419 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches!
L28418 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ You've been all through that with Lloyd-
L28417 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ - shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere - gives a performance!
L28416 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Now don't get carried away-
L28415 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
L28414 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Here we go...
L28413 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
L28412 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I'm trying terribly hard.
L28411 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
L28410 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Don't calm down.
L28409 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I will not calm down!
L28408 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
L28407 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
L28406 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ What a body, what a voice.
L28405 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
L28404 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Okay. Mix.
L28403 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I mix what I like.
L28402 +++$+++ u3600 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Don't mix your metaphors.
L28401 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
