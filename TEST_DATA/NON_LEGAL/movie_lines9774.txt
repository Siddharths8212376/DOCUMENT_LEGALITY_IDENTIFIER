L181692 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ What's on the call sheet?
L182505 +++$+++ u5005 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PINKER +++$+++ I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general.
L182504 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops.
L182329 +++$+++ u5005 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PINKER +++$+++ Bud White grilled me on it this morning.  You know, he's not as dumb as I thought.
L182328 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L182327 +++$+++ u5005 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PINKER +++$+++ Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
L182326 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ The Nite Owl.  Anything bothering you about the case?
L181929 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Hold on... We need to canvass. See if a purple Mercury was seen around here tonight.
L181928 +++$+++ u5005 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PINKER +++$+++ We got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells. Three men with five-shot-capacity pumps.  All of them reloading twice.
L182424 +++$+++ u5004 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PATCHETT +++$+++ Then try talking to my lawyer. Good evening, gentlemen.
L182423 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Not good enough.
L182422 +++$+++ u5004 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PATCHETT +++$+++ No.
L182421 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
L182420 +++$+++ u5004 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PATCHETT +++$+++ Why do men and women usually see each other?
L182419 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Why's she seeing Bud White?
L182418 +++$+++ u5004 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PATCHETT +++$+++ Lynn Bracken.
L182417 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ What's her name?
L182416 +++$+++ u5004 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PATCHETT +++$+++ A vulgar term, but yes.
L182415 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
L182414 +++$+++ u5004 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PATCHETT +++$+++ For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
L182413 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Bud White's been here?
L182412 +++$+++ u5004 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PATCHETT +++$+++ I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.
L182687 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
L182686 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
L182681 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Where is he?
L182680 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ Right now, before I back down.
L182679 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ When?
L182678 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
L182677 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Where will you go?
L182633 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ I know how he feels.
L182632 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
L182631 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
L182630 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ A police captain.  I think he's behind all of this.
L182629 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Forget everything else for a second, Lynn.  Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith?
L182628 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake.
L182474 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ Actually, Bud's only tough on the outside.
L182473 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ You, me and White, huh?
L182472 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
L182471 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ You're the first person to ever call me tough.
L182470 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
L182469 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ Because you'll use it against me. Won't you?
L182468 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Why not?
L182467 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
L182466 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Some reality.
L182465 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
L182464 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ You cut to the heart of things, don't you?  What about Lynn Bracken?  She going to be a hooker all her life?
L182463 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.
L182462 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ I don't hate White.  I really don't.  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.
L182461 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier?
L182460 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
L182459 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ I'll take your word for it.
L182458 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
L182457 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff?
L182456 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
L182455 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ How about White?
L182454 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ The silver screen's loss is your gain.
L182453 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ You sound like you mean it.
L182452 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
L182451 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ How was I?
L182445 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ The way you've underestimated Bud White?
L182444 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
L182443 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete.
L182441 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Why?
L182440 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ I'm curious about you.
L182438 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink?
L182437 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?  He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results.  But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down.
L182436 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.
L182435 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Really?  What did White say?
L182434 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
L182433 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
L182620 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ What's Dudley's scheme?
L182619 +++$+++ u5000 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LOEW +++$+++ Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got photos of me and Reynolds.
L182611 +++$+++ u5000 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LOEW +++$+++ I'm not going to dignify youwith answers.  If you'll excuse me, I've got a Jack Vincennes press conference to prepare for.
L182610 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
L182609 +++$+++ u5000 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LOEW +++$+++ Do you have any proof?
L182608 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
L182607 +++$+++ u5000 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LOEW +++$+++ Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
L182606 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ None.  Call it a hunch.
L182605 +++$+++ u5000 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LOEW +++$+++ On what evidence?
L182604 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
L182603 +++$+++ u5000 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LOEW +++$+++ It's okay.  These are police.  <u>What</u> do you want?
L182338 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
L182337 +++$+++ u5002 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ MRS. LEFFERTS +++$+++ My daughter was a virgin!
L182336 +++$+++ u5002 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ MRS. LEFFERTS +++$+++ All he found were rodents.  No signs of foul play.  So there.
L182335 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Under the house.
L182334 +++$+++ u5002 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ MRS. LEFFERTS +++$+++ A sweet man.
L182333 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Officer White?
L182332 +++$+++ u5002 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ MRS. LEFFERTS +++$+++ That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
L182331 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
L182330 +++$+++ u5002 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ MRS. LEFFERTS +++$+++ Let my Susie rest in peace!
L181961 +++$+++ u5002 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ MRS. LEFFERTS +++$+++ At Christmas.  We had fought.  I didn't like her boyfriend.  I -- she has a birthmark on her hip.
L181960 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
L181959 +++$+++ u5002 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ MRS. LEFFERTS +++$+++ It seems like my Susan, but...
L182257 +++$+++ u4998 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ HUDGEONS +++$+++ I put Reynolds in the cab myself. The night cost me a hundred scoots and I got bupkis.
L182256 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Loew didn't go with him.  You're sure?
L182255 +++$+++ u4998 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ HUDGEONS +++$+++ Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera.
L182254 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
L182253 +++$+++ u4998 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ HUDGEONS +++$+++ You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
L182252 +++$+++ u4998 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ HUDGEONS +++$+++ What happened with the kid and Loew?
L182251 +++$+++ u4998 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ HUDGEONS +++$+++ What's wrong, Trash?
L182250 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Shut up!
L182249 +++$+++ u4998 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ HUDGEONS +++$+++ Give me some Narco skinny.  I want to put out an all hop-head issue. Shvartze jazz musicians and movie stars.  Maybe tie it into the Rosenbergs.  You like?
L182248 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Sid, cut the crap.  I --
L182247 +++$+++ u4998 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ HUDGEONS +++$+++ Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
L182228 +++$+++ u4998 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ HUDGEONS +++$+++ Jackie, all I know is what you know.  The man is very rich.  And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer.  But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo.
L182227 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Around.
L182226 +++$+++ u4998 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ HUDGEONS +++$+++ Where'd you hear that?
L182225 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Sid, why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers?
L182204 +++$+++ u4998 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ HUDGEONS +++$+++ He's queer too.  Metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues.  On screen and off.  I'm getting him to fuck the D.A. for a hundred bucks.  That's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career.
L182203 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ And Reynolds?
L182202 +++$+++ u4998 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ HUDGEONS +++$+++ How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
L182201 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
L182200 +++$+++ u4998 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ HUDGEONS +++$+++ You tight with the D.A., trash?
L182199 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What's he doing here, Sid?
L182198 +++$+++ u4998 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ HUDGEONS +++$+++ The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm.
L182196 +++$+++ u4998 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ HUDGEONS +++$+++ Down around my ankles.
L182195 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Sid, how are they hanging?
L182194 +++$+++ u4998 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ HUDGEONS +++$+++ You're back, boychick.
L181906 +++$+++ u4998 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ HUDGEONS +++$+++ No.  No, I've heard bupkis.  Jack, I'll talk to you later.  Call me when you get something I can use. Smut's from hunger.  For sad sacks who can't get their ashes hauled
L181905 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
L181904 +++$+++ u4998 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ HUDGEONS +++$+++ Not a word.
L181903 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Don't know.  I'm chasing picture books.  Fuck shots, but the posers don't look like junkies.  It's well done stuff.  I thought you might have heard something.
L181902 +++$+++ u4998 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ HUDGEONS +++$+++ Something good?
L181901 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No.  But I've got something going with Ad Vice.
L181900 +++$+++ u4998 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ HUDGEONS +++$+++ Jackie, are you back on Narco?  I need copy.
L181899 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Sid, it's Vincennes.
L181898 +++$+++ u4998 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ HUDGEONS +++$+++ <u>Hush-Hush</u>.  Off the record and on the Q.T.
L181690 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah, it's subtle.
L181689 +++$+++ u4998 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ HUDGEONS +++$+++ It's Christmas morning in the City of Angels, and while decent citizens sleep the sleep of the righteous, hopheads prowl for marijuana, not knowing that a man is coming to stop them.  The free- wheeling, big-time Big V, celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes, the scourge of grasshoppers and junk fiends everywhere.  You like it, Jackie- Boy?
L181686 +++$+++ u4998 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ HUDGEONS +++$+++ I like it!  I like it!
L181685 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
L181684 +++$+++ u4998 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ HUDGEONS +++$+++ They're sitting in the dark, goofing on the Christmas tree.
L181683 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No.  It's felony possession of marijuana.
L181682 +++$+++ u4998 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ HUDGEONS +++$+++ Jack!  It's Christmas!
L181681 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
L181680 +++$+++ u4998 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ HUDGEONS +++$+++ Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
L181679 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You lost me, Sid.  Who?
L181678 +++$+++ u4998 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ HUDGEONS +++$+++ Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
L181677 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Is she?
L181676 +++$+++ u4998 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ HUDGEONS +++$+++ We did a piece last year. 'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her name got mentioned.
L181674 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
L181673 +++$+++ u4998 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ HUDGEONS +++$+++ Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?
L182341 +++$+++ u5003 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ Please hold, Sergeant...
L182340 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah.  Sergeant Jack Vincennes requesting.  I need the home address on a Pierce Patchett.
L181769 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ A bootleg...
L181768 +++$+++ u5003 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.
L181767 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I just called it.
L181766 +++$+++ u5003 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.
L181765 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ This is Sgt. Vincennes. Requesting a name and address on a phone number.  Hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine.
L181764 +++$+++ u5003 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ Pacific Coast Bell.
L182235 +++$+++ u5006 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Showbiz.
L182234 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It'll be our secret.
L182233 +++$+++ u5006 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ And no one'll know about this?
L182232 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on the show... But tonight? Pretend it's an acting job, kid. Showbiz.
L182219 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah.  Me neither.
L182218 +++$+++ u5006 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
L182217 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Really?  How?
L182216 +++$+++ u5006 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
L182215 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way back.
L182214 +++$+++ u5006 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett has it all.
L182213 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.'
L182212 +++$+++ u5006 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Oh, I know.  A Fleur-de-Lis party, right?
L182211 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Something like that.
L182210 +++$+++ u5006 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Was it a party?
L182209 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah.
L182208 +++$+++ u5006 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Have we met before?
L181894 +++$+++ u5009 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ VICE CAPTAIN +++$+++ Maybe you should have thought of that before you made Bloody Christmas page one.
L181893 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Working whores with squad two.
L181892 +++$+++ u5009 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ VICE CAPTAIN +++$+++ Oh?  Anyplace else?
L181891 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
L181890 +++$+++ u5009 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ VICE CAPTAIN +++$+++ Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
L181889 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
L183292 +++$+++ u5016 +++$+++ m333 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ Who are you calling?!
L183291 +++$+++ u5011 +++$+++ m333 +++$+++ "BRILL" +++$+++ 209 to anyone! I need some help here!
L183289 +++$+++ u5011 +++$+++ m333 +++$+++ "BRILL" +++$+++ Maybe you bumped into someone who took it and you didn't even know.
L183288 +++$+++ u5016 +++$+++ m333 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ Someone else?
L183287 +++$+++ u5011 +++$+++ m333 +++$+++ "BRILL" +++$+++ Don't know. Did you check everywhere? Maybe it was hidden in something. Maybe there was someone else--
L183286 +++$+++ u5016 +++$+++ m333 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ Um...who's that?
L183285 +++$+++ u5016 +++$+++ m333 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ Nothing. Two nights later I was robbed. I'm pretty sure they were pros.
L183284 +++$+++ u5011 +++$+++ m333 +++$+++ "BRILL" +++$+++ He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
L183283 +++$+++ u5016 +++$+++ m333 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ I just gave him my card.
L183282 +++$+++ u5016 +++$+++ m333 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ I'm telling you, I--
L183281 +++$+++ u5011 +++$+++ m333 +++$+++ "BRILL" +++$+++ Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
L183280 +++$+++ u5016 +++$+++ m333 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ Nothing.
L183279 +++$+++ u5011 +++$+++ m333 +++$+++ "BRILL" +++$+++ What'd he give to you?
L183278 +++$+++ u5016 +++$+++ m333 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ Nothing.
L183277 +++$+++ u5011 +++$+++ m333 +++$+++ "BRILL" +++$+++ What'd he say to you?
L183276 +++$+++ u5016 +++$+++ m333 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ Yes.
L183275 +++$+++ u5011 +++$+++ m333 +++$+++ "BRILL" +++$+++ And you were the last one to talk to him.
L183274 +++$+++ u5016 +++$+++ m333 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ <u>They</u> said he was behind an extortion scheme.
L183273 +++$+++ u5011 +++$+++ m333 +++$+++ "BRILL" +++$+++ You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
L183272 +++$+++ u5016 +++$+++ m333 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ I don't know anything about Zavitz.
L183271 +++$+++ u5011 +++$+++ m333 +++$+++ "BRILL" +++$+++ They found him yesterday folded neatly in a car trunk. What about Zavitz?
L183270 +++$+++ u5016 +++$+++ m333 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ Oh Jesus.
L183269 +++$+++ u5011 +++$+++ m333 +++$+++ "BRILL" +++$+++ DePinto's dead.
L183268 +++$+++ u5016 +++$+++ m333 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ It started with the information you gave me on DePinto. After we talked, he agreed to resign. Next, a phony detective asked me about Daniel Zavitz. Then an investigator questioned me about an extortion scheme they claimed Zavitz was behind. The FBI started looking into mob connections. A doctored picture in the paper. Overnight, I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank accounts, everything gone.
L183267 +++$+++ u5011 +++$+++ m333 +++$+++ "BRILL" +++$+++ What happened?
L183263 +++$+++ u5011 +++$+++ m333 +++$+++ "BRILL" +++$+++ Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field.  My name doesn't matter.
L183262 +++$+++ u5016 +++$+++ m333 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ Brill?
L183819 +++$+++ u5012 +++$+++ m333 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ You're not.
