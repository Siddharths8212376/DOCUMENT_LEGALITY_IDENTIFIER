L353765 +++$+++ u6325 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Now or later, Charley. You won't have any trouble finding me.
L353764 +++$+++ u6353 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You little pissant--
L353763 +++$+++ u6325 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
L353762 +++$+++ u6353 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You're fired. You're outta the department.
L353761 +++$+++ u6325 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Whole different story; isn't it?
L353760 +++$+++ u6353 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Who said anything about shootin' anybody?
L353759 +++$+++ u6325 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ You ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye?
L353757 +++$+++ u6353 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
L353756 +++$+++ u6325 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I'm not picking it up.
L353755 +++$+++ u6353 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
L353754 +++$+++ u6325 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ That's not the point.
L353753 +++$+++ u6353 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
L353752 +++$+++ u6325 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up.
L353748 +++$+++ u6353 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I roust some muchacho on the street, doesn't have his papers, all he got to say is "Yo trabajo para Jimmy Herrera."
L353747 +++$+++ u6325 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ So?
L353746 +++$+++ u6353 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.
L353745 +++$+++ u6325 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ What's that for?
L354691 +++$+++ u6326 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ Thanks. I like it when you say that, Sam.
L354690 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
L354689 +++$+++ u6326 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ "I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.
L354688 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
L354687 +++$+++ u6326 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
L354686 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What?
L354685 +++$+++ u6326 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ 350 pounds.
L354683 +++$+++ u6326 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
L354682 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ It wasn't just you, Bunny.
L354681 +++$+++ u6326 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
L354680 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Suppose not.
L354679 +++$+++ u6326 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
L354678 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
L354677 +++$+++ u6326 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
L354676 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No. You?
L354675 +++$+++ u6326 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?
L354674 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?
L354673 +++$+++ u6326 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now".
L354672 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Best part of the job.
L354671 +++$+++ u6326 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ You look awful good in that uniform, though.
L354670 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Same weight I always was.
L354669 +++$+++ u6326 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.
L354668 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You were in a fight--
L354667 +++$+++ u6326 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ --they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her.
L354666 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yeah, well--
L354665 +++$+++ u6326 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ --and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
L354664 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You look good--
L354663 +++$+++ u6326 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
L354662 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No, you look good. I was just wondering.
L354661 +++$+++ u6326 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ Do I seem jumpy?
L354660 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
L354659 +++$+++ u6326 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
L354658 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You still going to all the home games?
L354657 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--
L354656 +++$+++ u6326 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ Oh. Right. And you're in--?
L354655 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ That's in Maverick County.
L354654 +++$+++ u6326 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--
L354719 +++$+++ u6327 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ He never asked her.
L354718 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ My mother said he never asked about--
L354717 +++$+++ u6327 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
L354716 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.
L354715 +++$+++ u6327 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and  all?
L354714 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ I'm a colonel.
L354713 +++$+++ u6327 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it.
L354712 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Uncle Al--
L354711 +++$+++ u6327 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
L354710 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Where'd he get all this?
L354706 +++$+++ u6327 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ There was a bunch of 'em You never met. Me neither.
L354705 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ I never met her.
L354704 +++$+++ u6327 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
L354703 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ You've been in this house for a while?
L354700 +++$+++ u6327 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Come on in.
L354699 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ If it's too late--
L354698 +++$+++ u6327 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Come on in--
L354697 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
L354696 +++$+++ u6327 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Hey, it's the General.
L354199 +++$+++ u6327 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ So that's him--
L354198 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ You'll get official notification when I make my decision. He is out the door--Otis pulls himself a beer as Carolyn steps back out--
L354612 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Well, he's living proof of that, son. Living proof.
L354611 +++$+++ u6328 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ My father says the day you're  born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own.
L354610 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.
L354609 +++$+++ u6328 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ So I'm part-Indian?
L354608 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
L354607 +++$+++ u6328 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ So how come you got into all this?
L354606 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ When you're his age you'll still be pissed off about him.
L354605 +++$+++ u6328 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ He's still pissed off about it.
L354604 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Didn't have a father?
L354603 +++$+++ u6328 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
L354602 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Well--
L354601 +++$+++ u6328 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
L354600 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ PDA?
L354599 +++$+++ u6328 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
L354598 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
L354597 +++$+++ u6328 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
L354596 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ You didn't go telling your father you were here?
L354595 +++$+++ u6328 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ That guy who got shot--
L354594 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ I got a pretty good guess.
L354593 +++$+++ u6328 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ You know who I am?
L354592 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ They were in the Army. Like your father.
L354591 +++$+++ u6328 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ But they were Indians themselves.
L354590 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Same as they done in Mexico.
L354589 +++$+++ u6328 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ They fought against the Indians?
L354588 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--
L354587 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ They got tired of fighting, went to the Indian Territories for a while. But the slave-raiders were on 'em even there, and one night they packed up and nearly the whole band rode down to Mexico. Crossed at Eagle Pass.
L354586 +++$+++ u6328 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ So they stayed in Florida?
L354585 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
L354584 +++$+++ u6328 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ The Trail of Tears.
L354583 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days. African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children. When the Spanish give up Florida, the U.S.Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma--
L354582 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Both.
L354581 +++$+++ u6328 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ He a Black man or an Indian?
L354580 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo. John Horse.
L353795 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Go out through the back.
L353794 +++$+++ u6328 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ No sir.
L353793 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ You weren't in here tonight, were you?
L354792 +++$+++ u6328 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ Cool.
L354791 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Maybe we'll clean that thing out back up, have a barbecue next weekend. We could invite him and his wife over.
L354790 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ He does.
L354789 +++$+++ u6328 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ Yeah. He lives here, right?
L354788 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ My father.
L354787 +++$+++ u6328 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ Are we going to ever see your father?
L354786 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Good.
L354785 +++$+++ u6328 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
L354784 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ How's your room shaping up?
L354783 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ No.
L354782 +++$+++ u6328 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ You wouldn't?
L354781 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Not that I don't think you'd be good at it, but--you know--I wouldn't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life.
L354777 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ So you're going into the Army?
L354776 +++$+++ u6328 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.
L354775 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Tanks, huh?
L354774 +++$+++ u6328 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ I finished that. I'm just messing around.
L354773 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Homework?
L354090 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point?
L354089 +++$+++ u6328 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ I have a B average.
L354088 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--
L354087 +++$+++ u6328 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ Dad, I talked to the track coach--
L354084 +++$+++ u6328 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ Dad, can I talk to you about track?
L354083 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Big O was always there with a  smile or a loan or a free drink.
L354081 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ "Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"
L354080 +++$+++ u6328 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ Dad--?
L354077 +++$+++ u6328 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ Dad--
L354076 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Otis Payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life.
L354440 +++$+++ u6329 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHUCHO +++$+++ My government can go fuck itself, and so can yours. I'm talking about people here--men. Mi amigo Eladio Cruz is giving some friends of his a lift in his camion one day--
L354439 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it
L354438 +++$+++ u6329 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHUCHO +++$+++ Bird flying south-you think he sees that line? Rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different. So why should a man?
L354435 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You ever know a fella named Eladio Cruz?
L354434 +++$+++ u6329 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CHUCHO +++$+++ Something like that.
