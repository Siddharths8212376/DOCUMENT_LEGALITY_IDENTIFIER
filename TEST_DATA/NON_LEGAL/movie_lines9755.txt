L169579 +++$+++ u4888 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ I'm under the assumption that this is a free country and one can live where he pleases.
L169578 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ What do you want to live in a Black neighborhood for?  Motherfuck gentrification.
L169577 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ Who told you to buy a brownstone on my block, in my neighborhood on my side of the street?

L169799 +++$+++ u4892 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ JADE +++$+++ Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.
L169798 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ Yeah, I asked him.  I don't want nobody in there, nobody spending good money in Sal's.  He should get no mo' money from the community till he puts some Black faces up on that motherfucking wall.
L169797 +++$+++ u4892 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ JADE +++$+++ Did you ask Sal?
L169796 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ And I--we--want some Black people up.
L169795 +++$+++ u4892 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ JADE +++$+++ And?
L169794 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian.
L169789 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ Have you noticed something about them?
L169788 +++$+++ u4892 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ JADE +++$+++ So?
L169787 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame?
L169786 +++$+++ u4892 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ JADE +++$+++ What did he do this time?
L169785 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
L169784 +++$+++ u4892 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ JADE +++$+++ That's not even true.  I just want a slice.
L170039 +++$+++ u4900 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ It's about turning that shit off and getting the fuck outta my pizzeria.
L170038 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ Why it gotta be about jungle music and Africa?
L170037 +++$+++ u4900 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Turn that JUNGLE MUSIC off.  We ain't in Africa.
L170036 +++$+++ u4887 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ BUGGIN' OUT +++$+++ No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.
L170035 +++$+++ u4900 +++$+++ m326 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ What da fuck!  Are you deaf?
