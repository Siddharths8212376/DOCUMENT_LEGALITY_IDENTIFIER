L12642 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ It may have happened, but not the way you said.
L12641 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
L12640 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
L12639 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah.
L12638 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
L12637 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
L12636 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
L12635 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Not particularly.
L12634 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
L12633 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.
L12632 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ A hunting accident is perfect.
L12631 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
L12630 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
L12629 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
L12628 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
L12627 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I don't know. You tell me.
L12626 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
L12625 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
L12624 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Money.
L12623 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Motive. You gotta have a motive.
L12622 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
L12621 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Then who shot him?
L12620 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ That it wasn't an accident.
L12619 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Which is?
L12618 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
L12617 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Find them everywhere. 
L12616 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Want to know what I think happened?
L12615 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
L12614 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
L12613 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
L12612 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
L12611 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Well, do you still plan to get married?
L12610 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ What about her?
L12609 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ What about Margie?
L12573 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah. I forgot.
L12572 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ No thanks. I don't drink.
L12571 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
L12569 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
L12568 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
L12458 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
L12457 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Haven't you already done a bit of that?
L12456 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
L12455 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Get some sleep.
L12454 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah, I guess.
L12453 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
L12452 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill.
L12451 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ What happened?
L12450 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
L12449 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Who?
L12448 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
L12447 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ How was she?
L12446 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ The night before the shooting.
L12445 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Huh?
L12444 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Lillian was here. In Lawford.
L12443 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
L12442 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Well, it was an accident.
L12441 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ You think Jack shot him?
L12440 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ No shit.
L12439 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Twombley.
L12438 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Who?
L12437 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
L12436 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
L12435 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did.
L12434 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
L12433 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
L12432 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ There was something. It happened up your way.
L12431 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
L12430 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Wade?
L12429 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Rolfe.
L17221 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Jim... for godsake!
L17220 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Daddy. Daddy, please...
L17000 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.
L16999 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes dear?
L16998 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Mom?
L16676 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.
L16675 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.
L16674 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ That's not really the point.
L16673 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Some kids were teasing you?
L16672 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
L16671 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Your father never means to be so...
L16670 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
L16669 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ No, it's okay.  After all, he is the President, right?
L16668 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I'm sorry, honey.
L16667 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
L16666 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I know, Mom.  It was great... really.
L16665 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
L16664 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Back at The Fishbowl?
L16663 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
L16662 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
L16661 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Alice...
L16660 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
L16658 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Don't you even want to ask?
L16657 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I'm sure he's busy.
L16656 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You don't want to say hi to your father?
L16653 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Yeah, no duh.
L16652 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, you aren't the President, dear.
L16651 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.
L17197 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ You are a resilient man, Mr.
L17196 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ He didn't leave us.
L17107 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
L17106 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
L17061 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
L17060 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ The woman you shot. She was my friend.
L16918 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Yeah. Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.
L16917 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
L16916 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
L16915 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
L16914 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
L16907 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
L16906 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
L16905 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I don't drink coffee.
L17398 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Okay, I'm slowing us down.
L17397 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ There they are!
L17301 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
L17300 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
L17288 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Been better, Dad... You?
L17287 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ How you doing, sweetie?
L17217 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Alice... I...
L17216 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Daddy...
L16754 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Daddy...
L16753 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Alice!
L16682 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ How `bout a hug for the old man.
L16681 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It was the experience of a lifetime.
L16680 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ How was...  ...the ballet?
L16679 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Hey, you guys back already?
L16678 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Oooooh, I'm good.
L17310 +++$+++ u156 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ CERALLOS +++$+++ Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
L17309 +++$+++ u163 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ IRAQI SOLDIER +++$+++ The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
L17308 +++$+++ u156 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ CERALLOS +++$+++ The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
L17307 +++$+++ u163 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ IRAQI SOLDIER +++$+++ They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
L17306 +++$+++ u156 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ CERALLOS +++$+++ It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
L17305 +++$+++ u163 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ IRAQI SOLDIER +++$+++ Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
L17304 +++$+++ u156 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ CERALLOS +++$+++ Did we warn them off?
L17303 +++$+++ u163 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ IRAQI SOLDIER +++$+++ The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
L17077 +++$+++ u157 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ CHIEF MECHANIC +++$+++ cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
L17076 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ It's cut.
L17071 +++$+++ u157 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ CHIEF MECHANIC +++$+++ Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them?
L17070 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
L17069 +++$+++ u157 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ CHIEF MECHANIC +++$+++ Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
L17068 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Got it.
L17067 +++$+++ u157 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ CHIEF MECHANIC +++$+++ Do you see the maintenance panel?
L17379 +++$+++ u158 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ COL. CARLTON +++$+++ Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.
L17378 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
L17377 +++$+++ u158 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ COL. CARLTON +++$+++ Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
L17376 +++$+++ u158 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ COL. CARLTON +++$+++ Lemme take a look.
L17375 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
L17374 +++$+++ u158 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ COL. CARLTON +++$+++ Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
L17373 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Uh, we got a problem here.
L17359 +++$+++ u158 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ COL. CARLTON +++$+++ We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
L17358 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ How we doing, Colonel?
L17357 +++$+++ u158 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ COL. CARLTON +++$+++ Stay cool.
L17356 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Got it.
L17355 +++$+++ u158 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ COL. CARLTON +++$+++ Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
L17354 +++$+++ u158 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ COL. CARLTON +++$+++ Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
L17350 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ I'm doing what I can.
L17349 +++$+++ u158 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ COL. CARLTON +++$+++ Who's flying the fucking plane?
L17348 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ He's busy being dead.
L17347 +++$+++ u158 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ COL. CARLTON +++$+++ Put your pilot on.
L17346 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ You read my mind.
L17345 +++$+++ u158 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ COL. CARLTON +++$+++ Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
L17338 +++$+++ u158 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ COL. CARLTON +++$+++ Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
L17337 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
L17384 +++$+++ u161 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GENERAL NORTHWOOD +++$+++ That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
L17383 +++$+++ u159 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ I prefered the terrorists.
L17382 +++$+++ u161 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GENERAL NORTHWOOD +++$+++ They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.
L17279 +++$+++ u159 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ This doesn't make sense.
L17278 +++$+++ u161 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GENERAL NORTHWOOD +++$+++ They aren't answering their hails.
L16849 +++$+++ u159 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
L16848 +++$+++ u161 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GENERAL NORTHWOOD +++$+++ Walter, if you have a point, make it.
L16844 +++$+++ u161 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GENERAL NORTHWOOD +++$+++ Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands.
L16843 +++$+++ u159 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ We don't know that.
L16842 +++$+++ u161 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GENERAL NORTHWOOD +++$+++ He's dead then. They must have killed him.
L16718 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
L16717 +++$+++ u160 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ DOHERTY +++$+++ The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
L16591 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.
L16590 +++$+++ u160 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ DOHERTY +++$+++ Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.
L16581 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
L16580 +++$+++ u160 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ DOHERTY +++$+++ It was a good ad-lib, sir.
L16579 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
L16578 +++$+++ u160 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ DOHERTY +++$+++ Sir, you threw out page two.
L17386 +++$+++ u161 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GENERAL NORTHWOOD +++$+++ To swear you in as President.
L17385 +++$+++ u177 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ V.P. CHANDLER +++$+++ The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
L17285 +++$+++ u177 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ V.P. CHANDLER +++$+++ If fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage.
L17284 +++$+++ u161 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GENERAL NORTHWOOD +++$+++ Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
L17283 +++$+++ u177 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ V.P. CHANDLER +++$+++ If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
