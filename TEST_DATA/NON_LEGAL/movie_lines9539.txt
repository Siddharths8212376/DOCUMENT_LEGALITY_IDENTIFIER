L43228 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, I-I left it at your house.
L43227 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yep. I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. You got a broom or something with a-
L43226 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Two?
L43225 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Two... Yeah. Lotta, lotta trouble. There's two of 'em.
L43224 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah?
L43223 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Very big spider.
L43222 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh. What?
L43221 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Darling, darling, I've been killing spiders since I was thirty, okay?
L43220 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times.
L43219 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Is he in the bathroom?
L43218 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
L43217 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, where is the spider?
L43216 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
L43215 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
L43214 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
L43213 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Well, I was in be- It's three o'clock in the morning. You, uh, you got me outta bed, I ran over here, I couldn't get a taxi cab. You said it was an emergency, and I didn't ge- I ran up the stairs. Hell - I was a lot more attractive when the evening began. Look, uh, tell- Whatta you- Are you going with a right-wing rock-and- roll star? Is that possible?
L43212 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? Not only that, you look thin and tired.
L43211 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
L43210 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
L43209 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ What is this? What are you, since when do you read the "National Review"? What are you turning in to?
L43207 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, humdinger. When- Well, I got a wonderful idea. Why don'tcha get the guy who took you to the rock concert, we'll call him and he can come over and kill the spider. You know, it's a-
L43206 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It was just great!
L43205 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
L43204 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L43203 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
L43202 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
L43201 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over.
L43200 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No.
L43199 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
L43198 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
L43197 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oooh.
L43196 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
L43195 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
L43194 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
L43193 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ What?
L43192 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ There's a spider in the bathroom.
L43191 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Are you okay?  What's the matter?  Are you all right? What-
L43190 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh.
L43189 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ What's- It's me, open up.
L43141 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
L43140 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I'm following you and David, if you-
L43139 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
L43138 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ David! David! I can't believe this!
L43137 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
L43136 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
L43134 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ And, Alvy... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough.
L43133 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ She said, "Will it change my wife." You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.
L43132 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Life. I said, "life."
L43131 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
L43130 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
L43129 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
L43128 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Will it change my life?
L43127 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Will it change your wife?
L43126 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
L43125 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
L43124 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
L43123 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
L43122 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
L43121 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Whatta you mean? Me?
L43120 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
L43119 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Well, well, sure... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
L43118 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ and I keep, you know, it's-
L43117 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah?
L43116 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah, and he's strangling me...
L43115 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Sinatra?
L43114 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
L43113 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
L43112 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L43111 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
L43110 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
L43109 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
L43108 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ M'hm.
L43107 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
L43106 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
L43105 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ M'hm.
L43104 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
L43103 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ G-go on, I'm interested.
L43102 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ M'hm.
L43101 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
L43100 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
L43099 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ M'm.
L43098 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
L43097 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah?
L43096 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
L43095 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
L43094 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'm home!
L43092 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's a biblical name. Right? W-What does he call you? Bathsheba?
L43091 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It's his name.
L43090 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ David? You call your teacher David?
L43089 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him!
L43088 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Next thing you know he'll find you keen and peachy, you know? Next thing you know he's got his hand on your ass!
L43087 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Who cares? Who cares?
L43086 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ "Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
L43085 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
L43084 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
L43083 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about!
L43082 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
L43081 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ "Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
L43080 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
L43079 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
L43078 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
L43077 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That is the worst kind of paranoia.
L43076 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
L43075 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Do you realize how paranoid you are?
L43074 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Following is different. I was spying.
L43073 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, what is your definition of following?
L43072 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Why? 'Cause I... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? That's not following!
L43071 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You followed me!
L43070 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I didn't follow you!
L43069 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You followed me. I can't believe it!
L43014 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It's Easter. You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat. I think they're gonna really like you.
L43013 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah.
L43012 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
L43011 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately.  Thank you.
L43010 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
L43009 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You're so sure about it.
L43006 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
L43005 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L43004 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Are yuh?
L43003 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah. Yeah. And you know something? I think that I'm starting to get more of your references, too.
L43002 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.
L43001 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Alvy, you were... Alvy, you were just great, I'm not kidding. It was- You were so neat.
L42993 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Hey, what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love.
L42992 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Were you always funny?
L42991 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
L42990 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ M'hm.
L42989 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
L42988 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, I need grass and so do you.
L42987 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
L42986 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, you have my body.
L42983 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?
L42982 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Let's just do it, all right?
L42981 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
L42980 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ U-huh.
L42979 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Really?
L42978 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No, I'm fine.
L42977 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
L42976 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Uh-uh-why?
L42975 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ M'm, wait, I got a great idea.  Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
L42974 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.
L42973 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
L42972 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What are you doing?
L42971 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, come, you don't need that.
L42970 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
L42969 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
L42968 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, what's the difference, anyway?
L42967 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
L42966 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It relaxes me.
L42965 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
L42964 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, have you ever made love high?
L42963 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
L42962 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
L42961 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No, don't be silly. What-what do we need other people for?  You know, we should-we should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide and seek or something.
L42960 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What?  Hey, listen, what-what do you think? Do you think we should, uh, go to that-that party in Southampton tonight?
L42959 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.
L42958 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Does this sound like a good course? Uh, "Modern American Poetry"? Uh, or, uh-let's see now... maybe I should, uh, take "Introduction to the Novel."
L42957 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ 'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating.
L42956 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?
L42955 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Hey, don't be ridiculous.
L42954 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
L42953 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
L42952 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yes, it is.

L42950 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
L42949 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment.  Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft... that we know that we're not married.
L42948 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ How is it any different?
L42947 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No-what, what...? I... we live together, we sleep together, we eat together. Jesus, you don't want it to be like we're married, do yuh?

L42941 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
