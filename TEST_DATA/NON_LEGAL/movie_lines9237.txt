L381688 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ I mean, I dunno.  I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  But never like this.
L381686 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.
L381685 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ This it?
L381677 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Scientific American?  Really?
L381676 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ We're from Scientific American.  We read about your discovery.  We'd like to take a look.
L382094 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Just a guess.  But I think found a nest.
L382093 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ How'd you know?
L382090 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Don't tell me.  Insects.
L382089 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
L382088 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ I got a planet check on that bug.  It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system.
L382087 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Yeah?  What's up?
L382049 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Oh shit!
L382048 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Actually, I don't know...
L382047 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Did it leave?
L382046 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Well, it wasn't in the jar...
L382009 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ They haven't announced it yet.  All I know is we're in motion for the most watched media event in history.
L382008 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Where's he making his big speech?
L382007 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ As far as I can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed.  All he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public.
L381956 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ They went to the President? Directly? THEY WENT OVER OUR HEADS?
L381955 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ They went right to the President.
L381954 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ And they're buying it?
L381943 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ What do we have?  Are we showing anything?
L381942 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I'm getting a trajectory...
L381933 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Dee?  What are you doing here?
L381932 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ They're gone.
L381888 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.
L381887 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Hard to tell.  I hope not.
L381886 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
L381885 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
L381884 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Elle's up in Portland-- three of her charges left visibly at a Trailblazers game.  Shots got a lot to mop up.  Tee says his Shanghai quadrasectionals haven't been around since morning.
L381883 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
L381882 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ He's gone, too.
L381780 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ What the hell is going on?
L381779 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ I need you in Philadelphia.  I got a code 90, in a-high school.
L381778 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
L381777 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Kay?  What's your 20?
L381596 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
L381595 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
L381468 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Fine.  Good.
L381467 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ How's Dee?
L381992 +++$+++ u1912 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ YAZ +++$+++ That and, well... I want my friends to see me on CNN.    Okay, I will admit it: ours is an illegal hookup.  We'll gladly pay when you can get your trucks out to install it.
L381991 +++$+++ u1910 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
L381990 +++$+++ u1912 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ YAZ +++$+++ A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
L381989 +++$+++ u1910 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
L381988 +++$+++ u1912 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ YAZ +++$+++ Why, you might ask?  Because you're ready.  Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it.
L381987 +++$+++ u1912 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ YAZ +++$+++ That's why you have doors, Mr. President.  Keys, however, are to lock the doors.  And locks, as you know, are to keep people out.  Why? Fear.  You humans are afraid.  So you set up boundaries.  Borders. Your car.  Your home.  Your country.  All the while your true enemy could very well be considered already here among you.  Well I am here to let that enemy go.  Because there's a border you didn't even know existed.  It's the border to the Universe.  And unlike your other borders, you humans didn't set this border up to keep other planets from you.  It was set up by others, to keep you away from them.  Until now.  Because I have been sent here to open the door.  To present you, so to speak, with the key to the universe.
L381986 +++$+++ u1910 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
L381985 +++$+++ u1912 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ YAZ +++$+++ Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?
L387158 +++$+++ u1915 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ AGATHA +++$+++ RUN!
L387157 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ What --
L387156 +++$+++ u1915 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ AGATHA +++$+++ I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.
L387153 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Oh, Jesus...
L387152 +++$+++ u1915 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ AGATHA +++$+++ She's not alive, but she didn't die.
L387151 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ She's still alive?
L387150 +++$+++ u1915 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ AGATHA +++$+++ She grew up.
L387149 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ She died?
L387148 +++$+++ u1915 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ AGATHA +++$+++ The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
L387147 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Who wanted her little girl back?
L387146 +++$+++ u1915 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ AGATHA +++$+++ Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.
L387066 +++$+++ u1915 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ AGATHA +++$+++ I am going back.  I see myself there.
L387065 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Agatha, you're never going back there.
L387064 +++$+++ u1915 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ AGATHA +++$+++ I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
L387063 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
L387062 +++$+++ u1915 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ AGATHA +++$+++ The other two will die without me.
L387061 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Why?
L387060 +++$+++ u1915 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ AGATHA +++$+++ I have to go back.
L387059 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Someplace safe.
L387058 +++$+++ u1915 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ AGATHA +++$+++ Where are we going?
L386981 +++$+++ u1915 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ AGATHA +++$+++ But you still have a choice.  The others never had a chance to see their future.  You did.
L386980 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
L386979 +++$+++ u1915 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ AGATHA +++$+++ Please, I want to go back...
L386977 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ You were right.  I'm not being set up.
L386976 +++$+++ u1915 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ AGATHA +++$+++ Anderton --
L386975 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
L386973 +++$+++ u1915 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ AGATHA +++$+++ What is it?
L386972 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Oh, God...
L386963 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I have to find out what happened to my life.  Agatha.  I'm not going to kill the man.  I don't even know him.
L386962 +++$+++ u1915 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ AGATHA +++$+++ Please --
L386961 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I can't.  I have to know.
L386959 +++$+++ u1915 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ AGATHA +++$+++ Anderton, leave.
L386958 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ He's here.
L386939 +++$+++ u1915 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ AGATHA +++$+++ Wait.
L386938 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Agatha...
L386937 +++$+++ u1915 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ AGATHA +++$+++ He won't.
L386936 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ He'll turn around.
L386935 +++$+++ u1915 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ AGATHA +++$+++ No.  Follow him.
L386933 +++$+++ u1915 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ AGATHA +++$+++ Do it.  Right here.  On the ground.
L386932 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Forget that guy --
L386931 +++$+++ u1915 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ AGATHA +++$+++ Drop some money.
L386927 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ What?
L386926 +++$+++ u1915 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ AGATHA +++$+++ Can you see the balloon man?
L386925 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Agatha --
L386920 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Agatha...
L386919 +++$+++ u1915 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ AGATHA +++$+++ Take it.
L386914 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Who?
L386913 +++$+++ u1915 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ AGATHA +++$+++ They're inside.
L386912 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ What?
L386828 +++$+++ u1915 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ AGATHA +++$+++ Is it now?
L386827 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ What?
L386826 +++$+++ u1915 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ AGATHA +++$+++ Is it now?
L386825 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I'm sorry, but I need your help. You contain information.  I need to know how to get it.  Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?  Can you tell me if --
L386291 +++$+++ u1915 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ AGATHA +++$+++ Can you see?
L386290 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Wally!
L387155 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ How did I not see this?  Agatha, who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?
L387154 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ John?  What is it?
L387144 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ I know... I do, too...
L387143 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
L387134 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Anne Lively...
L387133 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ About who?
L387132 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Because I found out about her...
L387131 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ Think, John.  Why would they set you up?
L387130 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Somewhere.
L387129 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ Found?  Where?
L387128 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Just some guy... they found.
L387127 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ Then who was he?
L387126 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ -- but he didn't.
L386708 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ -- go blind.  I know.
L386707 +++$+++ u1921 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ DR. EDDIE +++$+++ I'm setting up a timer.  When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  But not before then, or you'll --
L386702 +++$+++ u1921 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ DR. EDDIE +++$+++ Organic microbots that reconstruct the nerves and blood vessels. It'll feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs.  But whatever you do, don't scratch.
L386701 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ The nano... what?
L386700 +++$+++ u1921 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ DR. EDDIE +++$+++ I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
L386699 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I can't even stand up --
L386698 +++$+++ u1921 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ DR. EDDIE +++$+++ It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
L386697 +++$+++ u1921 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ DR. EDDIE +++$+++ Here --
L386696 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ How do I find the --
L386695 +++$+++ u1921 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ DR. EDDIE +++$+++ There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
L386644 +++$+++ u1921 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ DR. EDDIE +++$+++ How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
L386643 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
L386638 +++$+++ u1921 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ DR. EDDIE +++$+++ And put them out.  Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?  The future is much more interesting than the past.  Don't you think?
L386637 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ You set your patients on fire!
L386636 +++$+++ u1921 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ DR. EDDIE +++$+++ They were performance pieces.
L386635 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ You made those tapes...
L386634 +++$+++ u1921 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ DR. EDDIE +++$+++ Yes, you did.
L386633 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I put you away --
L386631 +++$+++ u1921 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ DR. EDDIE +++$+++ Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
L386630 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ From where?  D.C.?
L386629 +++$+++ u1921 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ DR. EDDIE +++$+++ Oh, yes.
L386628 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ We know each other?
L386627 +++$+++ u1921 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ DR. EDDIE +++$+++ You don't remember me, do you?
L386626 +++$+++ u1921 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ DR. EDDIE +++$+++ Tell you what, since you and I go way back, I'll give you my Old Pal discount.  How's that sound?
L386625 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ It's all I could safely move.
L386624 +++$+++ u1921 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ DR. EDDIE +++$+++ That's not much.
L386620 +++$+++ u1921 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ DR. EDDIE +++$+++ Whatever you say, John.
L386619 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
L386618 +++$+++ u1921 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ DR. EDDIE +++$+++ Why?
L386617 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
L386616 +++$+++ u1921 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ DR. EDDIE +++$+++ And replace them with new ones.
L386615 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Yeah --
L386614 +++$+++ u1921 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ DR. EDDIE +++$+++ Anesthesia.  Try to relax, John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
L386613 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Right.  I know --
L386612 +++$+++ u1921 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ DR. EDDIE +++$+++ You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
L386611 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ That's comforting.
L386610 +++$+++ u1921 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ DR. EDDIE +++$+++ Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
L387166 +++$+++ u1923 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ It's actually kind of a rush.  They say you get visions; that your life flashes before your eyes.  That all your dreams come true.
L387165 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Lara --
L387164 +++$+++ u1923 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
L386348 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?
L386347 +++$+++ u1923 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here, but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.
L386346 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
L386345 +++$+++ u1923 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch?"
L386344 +++$+++ u1923 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ No... we have the two previsions from the twins right here, but...  ... I can't pull up any data from the female.  Probably just a glitch.
L386343 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Try again.
L386342 +++$+++ u1923 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ Huh, we don't seem to have her data.
L386339 +++$+++ u1923 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
L386338 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
L386329 +++$+++ u1923 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ Not to mention, "Saved by the bell".
L386328 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ ... Graveyard shift.
L386327 +++$+++ u1923 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ Hence the expression...
L386321 +++$+++ u1923 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
L386320 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ You the only sentry?
L386319 +++$+++ u1923 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ For that, we have to go for a ride.
L386318 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Show me just Agatha's data stream.
L386317 +++$+++ u1923 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
L386316 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ This is the official composite of the three precogs?
