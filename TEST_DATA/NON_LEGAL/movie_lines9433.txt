L593460 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ He was the one behind Sollozzo?
L593459 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ Barzini.
L593458 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ You mean Tattaglia.
L593457 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
L593456 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
L593439 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ Now you've had your drink.
L593438 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Yes.
L593437 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ But you needed a drink first.
L593436 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
L593435 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
L593030 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ It's from Johnny.  It was announced this morning.  He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film.
L593029 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ What is this nonsense?
L592976 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait.  He won't last out the night.
L592975 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
L592974 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
L592973 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?
L592949 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ It's been two years.  He's probably in trouble again.
L592948 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
L592947 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Should I bring him in.
L592946 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ It is Johnny.  He came all the way from California to be at the wedding.
L592944 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ On a day like this.  Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now.  Write that down before you forget it.  The Turk will wait.
L592943 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ This morning.
L592942 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ When did he call?
L592941 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
L592940 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ And with prison record.
L592939 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ He's his own boss, and very competent.
L592937 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand.  Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil Sollozzo.
L592936 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.
L592890 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ You understand him better than anyone.
L592889 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ Is it necessary?
L593663 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ Good.
L593662 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Yes.
L593661 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ Your wife and children...you're happy with them?
L593659 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ He will get in touch with you through someone you absolutely trust.  That person will arrange a meeting, guarantee your safety...
L593658 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ How?
L593657 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ Barzini will move against you first.
L593656 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ There are men in this world who demand to be killed.  They argue in gambling games; they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender. These people wander through the streets calling out "Kill me, kill me."  Luca Brasi was like that. And since he wasn't scared of death, and in fact, looked for it...I made him my weapon.  Because I was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him.  I think you have done the same with this man.
L593655 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'll need him.
L593654 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ I see you have your Luca Brasi.
L593644 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ How did you find out?
L593643 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
L593553 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ What else do you believe in?
L593552 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
L593551 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice.
L593550 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Then why have I become a man like you?
L593549 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
L593548 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You wanted me to be your son.
L593547 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ No, I wanted other things for you.
L593546 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice.  From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me.
L593545 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ Accept what's happened, Michael.
L593544 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
L593543 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
L593542 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No.
L593541 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ Have you thought about a wife?  A family?
L592991 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ Good.  When you are finished, come and talk to me.  I have hopes for you.
L592990 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'm going to finish school.
L592989 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ And now, what do you choose to do?
L592988 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
L592987 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ What miracles you do for strangers.
L592986 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ For killing a man.
L592985 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ And this?
L592984 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ For bravery.
L592983 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ What was this for?
L592982 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Tom said he'd take care of it.
L592981 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?
L592881 +++$+++ u3107 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ NAZORINE +++$+++ An Act of Congress!
L592880 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen.
L592879 +++$+++ u3107 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ NAZORINE +++$+++ Godfather, you understand everything.
L592878 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ You want him to stay in this country.
L592877 +++$+++ u3107 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ NAZORINE +++$+++ Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy.  And you see, Godfather...  He...my daughter...they...
L592876 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do.
L592875 +++$+++ u3107 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ NAZORINE +++$+++ ...a fine boy from Sicily, captured by the American Army, and sent to New Jersey as a prisoner of war...
L593527 +++$+++ u3099 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON TOMMASSINO +++$+++ Bad news from America.  Your brother, Santino.  He has been killed.
L593526 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What is it?
L593525 +++$+++ u3099 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON TOMMASSINO +++$+++ Even so, I don't think it is safe here anymore.  I've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse. You must go right away.
L593524 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Is that why there are more men on the walls?
L593523 +++$+++ u3099 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON TOMMASSINO +++$+++ The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
L593522 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Things went badly in Palermo?
L593474 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
L593473 +++$+++ u3099 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON TOMMASSINO +++$+++ That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.
L593472 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Don Tommassino...I should see this place.
L593471 +++$+++ u3099 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON TOMMASSINO +++$+++ Long ago.  Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America.
L593470 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
L593469 +++$+++ u3099 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON TOMMASSINO +++$+++ There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
L593468 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Corleone.
L593467 +++$+++ u3099 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON TOMMASSINO +++$+++ Where are you going?
L593466 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I know.
L593465 +++$+++ u3099 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON TOMMASSINO +++$+++ You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
L593464 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
L593463 +++$+++ u3099 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON TOMMASSINO +++$+++ Michael, why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
L593462 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Don Tommassino.
L593530 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No, she's going home to her family. She'll join me in a few weeks...
L593529 +++$+++ u3100 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ FABRIZZIO +++$+++ Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
L593528 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Get the car.  I'll be leaving in ten minutes.  Where's Calo?
L593487 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Shhhhh.
L593486 +++$+++ u3100 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ FABRIZZIO +++$+++ Hey, beautiful girls!
L593482 +++$+++ u3100 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ FABRIZZIO +++$+++ Take me to America!  You need a good lupara in America?  You take me, I'll be the best man you got.  "Oh say, can you seeee...By da star early light..."
L593481 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Yes.
L593480 +++$+++ u3100 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ FABRIZZIO +++$+++ Hey America!  Is she as rich as they say?
L593479 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
L593478 +++$+++ u3100 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ FABRIZZIO +++$+++ We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
L593477 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ How do you know I come from America?
L593476 +++$+++ u3100 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ FABRIZZIO +++$+++ You tell us about America.
L593515 +++$+++ u3114 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ VITELLI +++$+++ Come Sunday morning:  My name is Vitelli and my house is up there on the hill, above the village.
L593514 +++$+++ u3100 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ FABRIZZIO +++$+++ It's the real Thunderbolt, then.
L593499 +++$+++ u3100 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ FABRIZZIO +++$+++ And hair.  Black and curly, like a doll.  And such a mouth.
L593498 +++$+++ u3114 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ VITELLI +++$+++ Beautiful all over, eh?
L593497 +++$+++ u3100 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ FABRIZZIO +++$+++ This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
L593496 +++$+++ u3114 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ VITELLI +++$+++ I know about what you mean!
L593495 +++$+++ u3100 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ FABRIZZIO +++$+++ This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
L593494 +++$+++ u3114 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ VITELLI +++$+++ You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight. 
L593599 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ The Don has semi-retired.  I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me.
L593598 +++$+++ u3101 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him.
L593575 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
L593574 +++$+++ u3101 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Mike, you sure about Moe selling. He never mentioned it to me and he loves the business.
L593572 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Get rid of them...
L593571 +++$+++ u3101 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Mike!
L593570 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Give them some money and send them home.
L593569 +++$+++ u3101 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ That's for you to find out.
L593568 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Who are those girls?
L593567 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Come here a minute, Fredo.
L593566 +++$+++ u3101 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Mike!  The party starting!
L593565 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No.
L593564 +++$+++ u3101 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Ever seen anything like that before?
L593561 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You look good, too.
L593560 +++$+++ u3101 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.  That doctor did some job on your face.
L593559 +++$+++ u3101 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner.
L593558 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport?
L593393 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Well it's war!  We might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time Consiglere, a Sicilian.  Pop had Genco, who do I have?  Hey Tom, hey...hey.  It's Sunday, we're gonna have dinner.  Don't be sore.
L593392 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
L593391 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
L593390 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
L593389 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks.  I want to get things going good before he gets better.  What's the matter with you?
L593384 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapers...about McCluskey's being tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Rackets...things are starting to loosen up.
L593383 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Pop, they hit us and we hit them back.
L593331 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Can you do it Mike?
L593330 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Jesus, I don't know...
L593321 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ No.  Our informer in McCluskey's precinct.  Tonight at 8:00 he signed out for Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx.  Anyone know it.
L593320 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ One of Tattaglia's people?
L593299 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever.  We'll wait.
L593298 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard.  What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable.  Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain.  Never.  It would be disastrous.  All the five families would come after you Sonny; the Corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover.  So just...take that into consideration.
L593297 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom.  You just help me win.  Understood?
L593296 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal...
L593295 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ And when they shot me father...
L593294 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
L593293 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
L593292 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ The other families won't sit still for all out war.
L593291 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
L593290 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ We should hear what they have to say.
L593289 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
L593288 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
L593287 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.
L593286 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Was there a definite proposal?
L593187 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ OK forget it, just stay on the phone.
L593186 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  You know the old man doesn't want that.
L593173 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ OK, we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead.  But Tom, I want you to stay inside the Mall. You too, Mike, no chances.  Tessio, you hold your people in reserve, but have them nosing around the city.  The hospital is yours; I want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours a day.
L593172 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ We're all tired...
L593171 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
L593170 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
L593169 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ That's easy to say; it's not your father.
L593168 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.
L593167 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?
L593165 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Luca never sleeps over with a broad. He always goes home when he's through.  Mike, keep ringing Luca's number.
L593164 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.
L593163 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
L593162 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
L593161 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ What about Luca?  Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca.  That worries me.
L593159 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list.
L593158 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Is the hospital covered?
L592963 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Okay.  One minute.
L592962 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
L593376 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Mama, no.
L593375 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Will you give this letter to Michael.
L593371 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.
L593370 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Will you give this to him.
L593368 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Listen Tom, I let my cab go; can I come in to call another one?
L593367 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ An accident.  No one was hurt.
L593366 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ What was that?
L593365 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Nobody knows where he is.  We know he's all right, but that's all.
L593364 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
L593363 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You should call...
L593125 +++$+++ u3111 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SOLLOZZO +++$+++ Good...then you can go...  I don't like violence.  I'm a businessman, and blood is a big expense.
L593124 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
L593123 +++$+++ u3111 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SOLLOZZO +++$+++ I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
L593122 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
L593121 +++$+++ u3111 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SOLLOZZO +++$+++ The Don was slipping; in the old days I could never have gotten to him.  Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back.  Talk to Sonny, talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio...it's good business.
L593119 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Sonny will come after you with everything he's got.
L593118 +++$+++ u3111 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SOLLOZZO +++$+++ Sonny was hot for my deal, right? You know it's the smart thing to do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny into it.
L593010 +++$+++ u3116 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ WOLTZ +++$+++ Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny will never get that part because I hate that pinko punk and I'm going to run him out of the Movies.  And I'll tell you why.  He ruined one of Woltz Brothers' most valuable proteges.  For five years I had this girl under training; singing lessons!  Acting lessons!  Dancing lessons!  We spent hundreds of thousands of dollars--I was going to make her a star.  I'll be even more frank, just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it wasn't all dollars and cents.  That girl was beautiful and young and innocent and she was the greatest piece of ass I've ever ad and I've had them all over the world.  Then Johnny comes along with that olive oil voice and guinea charm and she runs off.  She threw it all away to make me look ridiculous.  A MAN IN MY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE MADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS!
L593009 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ I'm German-Irish.
L593008 +++$+++ u3116 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ WOLTZ +++$+++ You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
L593007 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?
L593006 +++$+++ u3116 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ WOLTZ +++$+++ Okay, but just tell him this is one favor I can't give.  But he should try me again on anything else.
L593005 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather. That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship.
L593684 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ A week from tonight.  In Brooklyn on Tessio's ground, where I'll be safe.
L593683 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Have you agreed on a meeting?
L593682 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I know now.  I'll make them call me Don.
L593681 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ How will they come at you?
L593680 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all.  I guess you've figured it all out?
L593679 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Did he give you his politicians?
