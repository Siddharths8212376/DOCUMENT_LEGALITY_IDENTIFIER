L456901 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.
L456457 +++$+++ u2534 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ HORSEMAN +++$+++ Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.
L456456 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I'll be waiting.
L456455 +++$+++ u2534 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ HORSEMAN +++$+++ I'll pay you another visit, with a share of the profits, once its sold.
L456454 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I'll pass the word on, then.
L456453 +++$+++ u2534 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ HORSEMAN +++$+++ Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
L456452 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Here it is; the last chapter.
L456760 +++$+++ u2536 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ LIBERTINE +++$+++ I'll fill every slippery hollow; if you're obliging, then you'll swallow!
L456759 +++$+++ u2535 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ INGENUE +++$+++ What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
L456758 +++$+++ u2536 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ LIBERTINE +++$+++ And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
L456757 +++$+++ u2535 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ INGENUE +++$+++ I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
L456756 +++$+++ u2536 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ LIBERTINE +++$+++ I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"
L456754 +++$+++ u2535 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ INGENUE +++$+++ Was ever a man more risquè? He wants to take me every way!
L456753 +++$+++ u2536 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ LIBERTINE +++$+++ My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!
L456746 +++$+++ u2535 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ INGENUE +++$+++ Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rouè!
L456745 +++$+++ u2536 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ LIBERTINE +++$+++ Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid it grows!
L456738 +++$+++ u2535 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ INGENUE +++$+++ Such gallantry in men is -- sadly -- a rarity; How lucky I am to receive his charity!
L456737 +++$+++ u2536 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ LIBERTINE +++$+++ At last she arrives, my hard-won bride! Hurry, my child, and scurry inside. There you'll find such treasures await you; Marzipan and meringue to sate you!
L457062 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
L457061 +++$+++ u2537 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADAME LECLERC +++$+++ You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?
L456911 +++$+++ u2537 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADAME LECLERC +++$+++ Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy.
L456910 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I'm only a laundress; not a detective.
L456900 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ "Well worth the dig!"
L456899 +++$+++ u2537 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADAME LECLERC +++$+++ Yes?
L456898 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ "The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."
L456897 +++$+++ u2537 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADAME LECLERC +++$+++ Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on.
L456896 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ "A habituè of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years."
L456894 +++$+++ u2537 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADAME LECLERC +++$+++ Come now, darling, give it a read.
L456893 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
L456892 +++$+++ u2537 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADAME LECLERC +++$+++ If you won't read it to your own Mama, then perhaps you ought not to be reading it at all.
L457159 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ "What shall I ready?" asked Fanchon. "My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"
L457158 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ ...yes, I've got that bit...
L457126 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air...
L457125 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
L457124 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
L457123 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ -- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!
L457122 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ -- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --
L457121 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
L457120 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Go on, child.
L457119 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!
L457118 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ You could whisper it through the walls of your cell.
L457117 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
L457116 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ It needn't be; not if you've another story.
L457114 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ First and foremost, he's a MAN. You remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it.
L457113 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
L457112 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
L457111 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --
L457110 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ You're far crueler than I, my sweet.
L457109 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.
L457108 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ It's only been described to me. In your books.
L457107 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Surely you've seen a man naked.
L457106 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ They decreed me a savage, and now they have made me one.
L457105 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ They've taken your clothes?
L456950 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I don't believe it!
L456949 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe...
L456946 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Tortures so arcane, so medieval, even I haven't the words to describe them. If you've an ounce of pity in your heart, you'll throw caution aside, and unlock my door...
L456945 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ What have they done to you now?
L456541 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ What's that then?
L456540 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.
L456539 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ You demand a lot from your readers, you do.
L456538 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
L456537 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ It's a long story, this one.
L456533 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Oh, you. You talk same as you write.
L456532 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
L456531 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
L456530 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ A kiss for each page.
L456528 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Fiendishly so.
L456527 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Is it terribly erotic?
L456526 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Most assuredly.
L456525 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Is it awfully violent?
L456524 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
L456523 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ I've just the story... inspired by these very surroundings....
L456522 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
L456521 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...
L456520 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ There's something else I want from you.
L456519 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.
L456518 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I put myself at life and limb. Surely that's worth a few louis.
L456517 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ The peril of composing such incendiary prose...
L456515 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
L456514 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
L456513 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
L456512 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Did I frighten you?
L456509 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Go ahead; you've a key. Slip it through my tiny hole...
L456508 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Don't start --
L456507 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ I'm hungry for a proper visit.
L457078 +++$+++ u2543 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ SIMONE +++$+++ No. But tell him I would.
L457077 +++$+++ u2539 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MONSIEUR PROUIX +++$+++ You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
L457076 +++$+++ u2543 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ SIMONE +++$+++ Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.
L457075 +++$+++ u2539 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MONSIEUR PROUIX +++$+++ "By the time you read this, we'll be long gone; bound for England or points beyond..."
L457074 +++$+++ u2543 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ SIMONE +++$+++ Tell him I'm no fool. A prison's still a prison, even with Chinese silk and chandeliers.
L457073 +++$+++ u2539 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MONSIEUR PROUIX +++$+++ "...your wife."
L457035 +++$+++ u2541 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ RENEE PELAGIE +++$+++ And why not? My fortune, siphoned away. My reputation, past repair. I've nothing left to lose.  Silence my husband, or you'll come to know an infamy to rival his own.
L457034 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
L457033 +++$+++ u2541 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ RENEE PELAGIE +++$+++ Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.
L457025 +++$+++ u2541 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ RENEE PELAGIE +++$+++ Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet --
L457024 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ You've no right to assault me in this fashion; I'll call for my footman. I'll have you removed --
L457021 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ I can say, with the utmost sincerity, that every franc you've given me has been put to sterling use.
L457020 +++$+++ u2541 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ RENEE PELAGIE +++$+++ If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
L457019 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ This is neither the time nor the place --
L457018 +++$+++ u2541 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ RENEE PELAGIE +++$+++ I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
L457017 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ Good God, Marquise --
L456875 +++$+++ u2541 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ RENEE PELAGIE +++$+++ Once... long ago... in the folly of youth... he made me love him.
L456874 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ Of course.
L456873 +++$+++ u2541 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ RENEE PELAGIE +++$+++ Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
L456872 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ And I in yours.
L456871 +++$+++ u2541 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ RENEE PELAGIE +++$+++ I am eternally in your debt.
L456868 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.
L456867 +++$+++ u2541 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ RENEE PELAGIE +++$+++ Don't toy with me, Doctor.
L456865 +++$+++ u2541 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ RENEE PELAGIE +++$+++ It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...
L456864 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ -- words alone are insufficient.
L456863 +++$+++ u2541 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ RENEE PELAGIE +++$+++ Oh, but I am!
L456862 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ If you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity --
L456861 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ That ill-gotten funds, borne of his degeneracy, might now effect his salvation.
L456860 +++$+++ u2541 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ RENEE PELAGIE +++$+++ What thought is that?
L456859 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
L456858 +++$+++ u2541 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ RENEE PELAGIE +++$+++ It's tainted money, Doctor.
L456857 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
L456856 +++$+++ u2541 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ RENEE PELAGIE +++$+++ I am not a wealthy woman.
L456855 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ Perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them...
L456854 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ That barely covers the cost of his room. There's nary a penny left over for appropriate treatments. Opiates to quell his temper. Restraints to chasten him when he misbehaves.
L456853 +++$+++ u2541 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ RENEE PELAGIE +++$+++ I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
L456852 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ You're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton...
L456848 +++$+++ u2541 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ RENEE PELAGIE +++$+++ Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.
L456847 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.
L456844 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband.  Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix?
L456843 +++$+++ u2541 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ RENEE PELAGIE +++$+++ You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
L456842 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ I pray you: be succinct.
L456841 +++$+++ u2541 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ RENEE PELAGIE +++$+++ I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.
L456840 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ My schedule is not subject to the whims of lunatics.
L456839 +++$+++ u2541 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ RENEE PELAGIE +++$+++ Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
L456838 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
L456829 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ It's a convenience, isn't it, having your husband locked away! You no longer have to hold your tongue, or hoist your skirts! Or crack your mouth, so I can put it to its one pleasurable use! YOU'RE NOT MY WIFE, NO! YOU'RE ONE AMONG MY MANY JAILERS, AREN'T YOU?
L456828 +++$+++ u2541 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ RENEE PELAGIE +++$+++ He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
L456827 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought audience with the Emperor --
L456826 +++$+++ u2541 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ RENEE PELAGIE +++$+++ Give me back my anonymity, that's all I ask! Let me be invisible again!
L456825 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
L456824 +++$+++ u2541 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ RENEE PELAGIE +++$+++ Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?
L456821 +++$+++ u2541 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ RENEE PELAGIE +++$+++ You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt.
L456820 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ They've put you up to this, haven't they?
L456819 +++$+++ u2541 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ RENEE PELAGIE +++$+++ To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
L456818 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ You've come to lecture me?
L456817 +++$+++ u2541 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ RENEE PELAGIE +++$+++ I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.
L456816 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?
L456815 +++$+++ u2541 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ RENEE PELAGIE +++$+++ How was I to know, my darling?
L456813 +++$+++ u2541 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ RENEE PELAGIE +++$+++ Forgive me, I beg you --
L456812 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm to sit here, gorging myself on useless trifles, sucking down your little sweetmeats, when what I truly need -- what I truly require -- are a few quill pens? Perhaps a pot of ink?
L456811 +++$+++ u2541 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ RENEE PELAGIE +++$+++ ....shame on you, truly...
L456810 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
L456884 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ You prefer a book to your husband's company?
L456883 +++$+++ u2543 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ SIMONE +++$+++ I'd rather read, thank-you.
L456882 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ I'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. There we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire.
L456881 +++$+++ u2543 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ SIMONE +++$+++ Very much.
L456880 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ Doesn't that please you?
L456743 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ Do as I say.
L456742 +++$+++ u2543 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ SIMONE +++$+++ But it's just begun --
L456741 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ Leave at once --
L469160 +++$+++ u2546 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ CAROLE LOMBARD +++$+++ She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money.
L469159 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ That poor woman.
L469154 +++$+++ u2546 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ CAROLE LOMBARD +++$+++ Don't insult me with your cute press quotes Save it for Louella.
L469153 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
L469152 +++$+++ u2546 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ CAROLE LOMBARD +++$+++ We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
L469151 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
L469150 +++$+++ u2546 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ CAROLE LOMBARD +++$+++ Of being found out. Of not being a genius
L469147 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Am I?
L469146 +++$+++ u2546 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ CAROLE LOMBARD +++$+++ You're just scared.
L469145 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I wonder sometimes.
L469144 +++$+++ u2546 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ CAROLE LOMBARD +++$+++ It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
L469143 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Not you too
L469142 +++$+++ u2546 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ CAROLE LOMBARD +++$+++ So you ever gonna do a picture?
L469091 +++$+++ u2546 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ CAROLE LOMBARD +++$+++ Last week would this be?
L469090 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ No, when I was but a tender lad--
L469089 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Ever met Walter Winchell?
L469654 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ But I am That's the killer, honey.
L469653 +++$+++ u2546 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ CAROLE LOMBARD +++$+++ Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
L469652 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
L469651 +++$+++ u2546 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ CAROLE LOMBARD +++$+++ Uh-huh
L469650 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
L469649 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
L469648 +++$+++ u2546 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ CAROLE LOMBARD +++$+++ Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
L469647 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
L469646 +++$+++ u2546 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ CAROLE LOMBARD +++$+++ Sure
L469645 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I did my best but, well, you know me
L469643 +++$+++ u2546 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ CAROLE LOMBARD +++$+++ And he did.
L469642 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a star.
L469131 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ He needs me here.
L469130 +++$+++ u2546 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ CAROLE LOMBARD +++$+++ Sure you can, just--
L469129 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I can't
L469128 +++$+++ u2546 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ CAROLE LOMBARD +++$+++ Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--
L469127 +++$+++ u2546 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ CAROLE LOMBARD +++$+++ Mm.
L469126 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
L469125 +++$+++ u2546 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ CAROLE LOMBARD +++$+++ Yeah, Orson's a real piece of work. But deep down, he's a good kid. Real deep down.
L469124 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
L469123 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?
L469122 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ With about twenty of his spies on my tail. No thanks.
L469121 +++$+++ u2546 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ CAROLE LOMBARD +++$+++ Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
L469120 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
L469119 +++$+++ u2546 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ CAROLE LOMBARD +++$+++ You need to get outta here, Rapunzel
L469118 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ God, these parties are the worst
L469072 +++$+++ u2546 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ CAROLE LOMBARD +++$+++ Houdini mice.
L469071 +++$+++ u2551 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
