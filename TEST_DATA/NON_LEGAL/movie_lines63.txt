L63320 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
L63319 +++$+++ u442 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ GARY BYRD +++$+++ Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?
L63097 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
L63096 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I gots to go, it's my Moms.
L63095 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
L63094 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Hold on a sec, I got a call.
L63093 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
L63092 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ This has to be a big mistake.
L63091 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
L63090 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?
L63023 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
L63022 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
L63021 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
L63020 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.
L63018 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Calm down, please.
L63017 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!
L62997 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Dunwitty, don't leave.
L62996 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
L62935 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.
L62934 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!
L62933 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.
L62932 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
L62931 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
L62930 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
L62929 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
L62928 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
L62927 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
L62926 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
L62925 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
L62924 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
L62923 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  It's un-American.  I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.
L62922 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.  This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing "Amos and Andy."  Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain.
L62812 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do?
L62811 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ We think so.
L62810 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
L62800 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ What are you talkin' 'bout?  It's the move.  Stay wid me now.  We're movin' fast.  What does everybody else think about this?
L62799 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I don't know about that plantation angle.
L62798 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.
L62797 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Ya first bad move.  Projects been done.  That's one of the problems now, everything, movies, TV, are set in the urban jungle, da hood. That's so tired.  Mantan's Millennium Minstrel Show should be set on a plantation.  In Alabama. 
L62796 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."
L62795 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting?
L62794 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Do we have characters?  How about Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and how could we forget Aunt Jemima.
L62793 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Who are the other characters?
L62792 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
L62791 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.
L62790 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Negroes would be in an uproar.
L62789 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.
L62788 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on.
L62787 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."
L62786 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Yep, you guessed it.
L62785 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
L62784 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
L62783 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Exactly!
L62782 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
L62781 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ What are there character traits?
L62780 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.
L62779 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ I want you take it there.  All the way to the edge and back.
L62778 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
L62777 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ That's a great handle.
L62774 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose?  Which one is Mantan again?
L62773 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
L62772 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
L62771 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
L62770 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ I'm feelin' dis'!
L62769 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ I'm lovin' it.  You know how I know? Because I'm getting a boner, my Johnson is hard, no disrespect my sister.
L62768 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
L62767 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ The name of the show?
L62766 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
L62765 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Word!!!
L62764 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I know you're familiar with minstrel shows.  They came about at the turn of the 19th century.  It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air.  Carol Burnett? HeeHaw?
L62763 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Go on.  Good so far.
L62762 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
L62761 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ I'm wid it.
L62760 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.
L62753 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.
L62752 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.
L62618 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
L62617 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
L62616 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ You will or you'll be back at BET so quick you'll never know what hit you.  I need a mid-season replacement and pronto.  It will be on the fast track.
L62615 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
L62614 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.
L62613 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?
L62612 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.
L62611 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I've never been given a fair shot.
L62610 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.
L62609 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ ...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
L62608 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...
L62607 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ I'm telling you it's not.
L62606 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
L62605 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again.
L62602 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.
L62601 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
L62600 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.
L62599 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Forget it.  I believe you're my most creative person I've got on staff.  You're hip.  You know what's happening.  I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me.
L62598 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
L62597 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
L62595 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.
L62594 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Do you know what C.P. Time is?
L62578 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.
L62577 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
L62576 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Four minutes ago.
L62575 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
L62574 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
L62573 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ I'm sorry I'm late.
L62572 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ ...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
L63170 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ Always keep 'em laughing.
L63169 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I love you too, Daddy.
L63168 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless, you're a good son, I love you.  You never gave me no trouble.
L63167 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Let's get him over to the bed.
L63164 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ In life?  I'ma keep on living, having a good drink, got me a good young woman, make a couple of dollars and make people laugh. Haven't I always tol' you all nigga's are entertainers?  The question is what are you gonna do, Peerless?
L63163 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I didn't mean that, in life.
L63162 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
L63161 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Where do you go from here?
L63160 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
L63159 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Nuthin' I can't handle.
L63158 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
L63157 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.
L63156 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ Enough about me, what's happening with you?
L63155 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ All I know is what happened to me. All that other mess I just file into the "life's too short" category.
L63154 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
L63153 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
L63152 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Daddy, it can't be just because of that.  There had to be other factors.
L63151 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.
L63150 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ That's what I'm askin'.
L63149 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ How did I end up at the third rate chittlin' circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell, Virginny? Is that what you're asking ya Daddy?
L63148 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ How did you end up here?
L63147 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink.
L63146 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
L63145 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ Purely for medicinal purposes.
L63144 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ My game is still strong.  No Viagra for me, don't need no chemicals. Just my tonic.
L63143 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Daddy, she's younger than me.
L63142 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ Good woman.  I trained her right.
L63137 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Pleased to meet you.
L63136 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
L63135 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ It's been a long time.
L63134 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.
L63133 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ It's me, Peerless.
L63132 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ Go away, unless you got my money.
L63131 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I want to speak with you.
L63130 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ What do you want?
L63180 +++$+++ u440 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DOT +++$+++ He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you.
L63179 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ He never showed it.
L63178 +++$+++ u440 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DOT +++$+++ Your father is proud of you.
L63177 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
L63176 +++$+++ u440 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DOT +++$+++ I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
L63175 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ So what's up with you?
L63174 +++$+++ u440 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DOT +++$+++ The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
L63173 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ So he drank himself into a stuper?
L63172 +++$+++ u440 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DOT +++$+++ Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
L63171 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ How long has my father been like this?
L63139 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Is that so?
L63138 +++$+++ u440 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DOT +++$+++ Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about.
L63659 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Give me the gun.
L63658 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.
L63655 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
L63654 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Don't make me have to use this.
L63504 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ And that's how you got me in the first place.
L63503 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
L63502 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
L63501 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Work related or otherwise?
L63500 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
L63499 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.
L63498 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ That's why it will be so much fun.
L63497 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ This is crazy.
L63496 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
L63495 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
L63494 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Light?
L63493 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
L63492 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Do you have to be so damn forthright?
L63491 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
L63490 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
L63489 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Please don't go there.
L63488 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
L63487 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ He's just playing big brother.
L63486 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
L63485 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
L63484 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
L63483 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I don't want to hear it.
L63482 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Why'd you do that?
L63318 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
L63317 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ How so?
L63316 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
L63315 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Is that good or bad?
L63314 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I thought it was appropiate.
L63313 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Thanks.
L63312 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
L63311 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ The Jolly Nigger Bank.
L63307 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
L63306 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ For what?
L63305 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ A gift.
L63304 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ What is this?
L63303 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
L63302 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ So you have your small victory, now what?
L63251 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Everybody shut up.
L63250 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.
L63247 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
L63246 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Who's side are you on?
L63060 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.
L63059 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.
L63053 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ The pleasure is mine.
