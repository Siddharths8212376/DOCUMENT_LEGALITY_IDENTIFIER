L565724 +++$+++ u8067 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I haven't said anything yet, J.J., but if -
L565723 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
L565722 +++$+++ u8067 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I thought we were talking about Sidney?
L565721 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that.
L565720 +++$+++ u8067 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I said Sidney!...
L565719 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Who said Sidney?
L565718 +++$+++ u8067 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Sidney is a liar!
L565711 +++$+++ u8067 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Alan was not...unbalanced when I married him.  And he was not...'indifferent to women' no matter what they said! HUNSECKER  I'm not fighting with you, puss...
L565710 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
L565709 +++$+++ u8067 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Then whose fault was it, J.J.?  It was someone's fault, wasn't it?
L565708 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ But that wasn't your fault, dear, what happened to Leslie.  I've told you that a million times...
L565707 +++$+++ u8067 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ It's just as if I've seen a ghost today...
L565705 +++$+++ u8067 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ History repeats itself.  Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this...
L565704 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Why are you trembling, dear...?
L565702 +++$+++ u8067 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ No, I'm not.  I'm not!
L565701 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Not being partial, are you?
L565700 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Yes, he phoned.  I don't know this boy too well.  Anything in these charges?
L565699 +++$+++ u8067 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Did Sidney tell you about it?
L565698 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
L565697 +++$+++ u8067 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Why?
L565696 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.
L565371 +++$+++ u8064 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ Why does everything you say sound like a threat?
L565370 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
L565369 +++$+++ u8064 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ There is some allusion here that escapes me...
L565368 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ This man is not for you, Harvey, and you shouldn't be seen with him in public.  Because that's another part of a press agents life - he digs up scandal among prominent men and shovels it thin among the columnists who give him space.
L565367 +++$+++ u8064 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ Now, come, J.J., that's a little too harsh.  Anyone seems fair game for you tonight.
L565326 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Now don't kid a kidder.
L565325 +++$+++ u8064 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too.  You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington.
L565323 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.
L565322 +++$+++ u8064 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black.
L565407 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ I remember ONCE when you didn't quite "put things together".  Boy! Was the Mayor mad!
L565406 +++$+++ u8060 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ KELLO +++$+++ Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
L565405 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry!
L565402 +++$+++ u8060 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ KELLO +++$+++ I don't believe it.
L565401 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Say hello to Sidney Falco.  Tickle him - he's been a bad boy tonight. He called you my fat friend.
L565400 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ She mighta jumped.  Love suicide?  Check it for me, Phil...it's a real heart throb.
L565399 +++$+++ u8060 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ KELLO +++$+++ Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.
L565398 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive?
L565397 +++$+++ u8060 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ KELLO +++$+++ I just checked "downtown".  Quiet everywhere tonight.
L565390 +++$+++ u8060 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ KELLO +++$+++ Bonna sera, commendatore.  Come sta?
L565389 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Hello, Harry.
L566066 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Susie, there's nothing wrong with Dallas!  Your brother and I arranged it all. And if the Leslie boy is still a squooshy item in your life, forget it! - your brother arranged that one, too!  I don't usually give away presents; but this is my gift to you: Get out of here!  Leave this man!
L566065 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ You're incapable of the truth...
L566064 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Listen with care - this will cost me everything, so you know I'm telling you the truth!
L566053 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Talk to her yourself...
L566052 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Talk to her, Sidney...
L566040 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Is that why you were romancing her, you mutt!  Let's call it quits, my dear.  I'd like it fine if you found another home.  That means the front door is open!  Pack your things, rent a moving van and GIT!  And as for marriage, let me hit you with a few choice facts: you aren't ready for marriage!  You're incompetent - a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men!
L566039 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I was trying to build her up, not tear her down -
L565900 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ J.J., I swear to you on my mother's life, I won't do it.  If you gave me your COLUMN I wouldn't do a thing like that...
L565899 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Sidney, I told you -
L565891 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ The man in jail is always for freedom.
L565890 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.
L565882 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Why give her real proof?  You nearly ruined her with her first husband - and you were right, J.J., - but she almost followed him out the window.  What do you want - a chronic invalid?
L565881 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ She knows now.
L565880 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Why do something that would drive them right back into each other's arms?  Not to mention that this time Susie would know who shot the arrow...
L565873 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ How does it matter who's sister? The main thing, they're through and -
L565872 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Are you listening?
L565860 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Sidney, I know human nature.  Susie lied to me - she'll see that boy again.
L565859 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ But not for anything I did today...
L565858 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ What are you so chipper about?  If I put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard!
L565806 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Wild?  Take a look at them and see who's wild...
L565805 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Don't go wild, Sidney.
L565804 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Let's forget cats and dogs and other pseudo-literary remarks--- I'll just lay it on the line!  What about that big rumpus in my office today?  You were there, Frank! Where, according to St. Dallas, J.J. was responsible for the Elwell smear!
L565765 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Calculated risk.  Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent.
L565764 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...
L565763 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ A pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match!  It's a new wrinkle to tell the truth... I never thought I'd make a killing on some guy's "integrity".
L565762 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ What does that mean - integrity?
L565761 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
L565760 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ What's this boy got that Susie likes?
L565759 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
L565758 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ And who's feet is she on now?
L565757 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
L565756 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!
L565755 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ No, that's the point - he won't accept your favor!  The manager yes, but not the boy.
L565754 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ But it's too late.  I got him back the job...
L565753 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I like that, too.  Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.
L565752 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Can't hurt?  I had to get him back his job.
L565751 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Can't hurt...
L565750 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
L565749 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
L565748 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ I got that boy coming over here.  What's so funny?
L565740 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Sure you can if you want to, and I know you'll want to...  By the way, what's your beef against little Sidney?
L565739 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I'm not sure I can reach him in time.
L565737 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ No, I won't...
L565736 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Susie, I like this new attitude of yours.  You're growing up and I like it!  I don't like it when you're limp and dependent, when you're odd and wayward.  This gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world.  Because, don't forget, dear, you won't always have me with you, will you...?
L565735 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I read your column every day...
L565734 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ You're picking up my lingo, hon.
L565733 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
L565732 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ He means that much to you...?
L565731 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Get Steve back his job...please...
L565730 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ How?
L565729 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
L565728 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Well, what have I got?  Alimony to a pair of tramps?  They're of no concern to me.  It's you who count, but don't get me wrong - I don't intend to let you break your neck again!
L565717 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?
L565716 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I know Steve.  No.
L565714 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ You mean they've been fired already, on the basis of this crude smear?
L565713 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ J.J., I want you to get them back their job, Steve and the Quintet.
L565440 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Tonight.  Before you go to bed. The cat is in the bag and the bag is in the river.
L565439 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ When?
L565438 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Uh huh.
L565433 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ What you promised - do it!  Don't finagle around.  It's later than you think.
L565432 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I'll do it, J.J. - don't get me wrong - in for a penny, in for a pound.  I'll see it through, but stop beating me around the head. Let me make a living!
L565431 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Ha!  My right hand hasn't seen my left hand for thirty years!
L565430 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.
L565429 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Not "we", Sidney, you!
L565428 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ No, lemme finish.  I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB!  That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head.  And Susan, like you said, she's growing up.  Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
L565427 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Are you finished?
L565426 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here." Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column...
L565424 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ I'll listen one more minute.
L565423 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
L565422 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ I don't?
L565421 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Frankly, J.J., I don't think you got the cards to blitz me.
L565419 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Why not break it up yourself?  You could do it in two minutes flat.
L565418 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
L565417 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
L565416 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ You told me you'd break up that romance - when?
L565413 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ I like Harry, but I can't deny he sweats a little.
L565412 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Spahish...that must show he likes "spigs", too.
L565364 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ The day that I can't get along without press agents' handouts, I'll close up shop, lock, stock and barrel and move to Alaska.
L565363 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I didn't say that, J.J.
L565362 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Yes, with your clients' names attached.  That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world!  Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!
L565361 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ You print them, don't you?
L565360 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ What, some cheap, gruesome gags?
L565355 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ You just had a good example of it. A press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna.
L565354 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Why don't you answer the man, Sidalee?  He's trying to take you off the hook.
L565351 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Not just this minute, J.J....
L565350 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Match me, Sidney...
L565331 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Everyone knows Manny Davis...  ...except MRS. Manny Davis.
L565330 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I know Manny Davis.
L565320 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I have a message from your sister.
L565319 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Mac!  I don't want this man at my table...
L565315 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ No.  You're dead, son - get yourself buried!
L565314 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Can I come in for a minute?
L565313 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
L565312 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
L565311 +++$+++ u8059 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ HUNSECKER +++$+++ Can I come out?  No.
L566091 +++$+++ u8060 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ KELLO +++$+++ Yeah...  And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'...  You know J.J....!
L566090 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I thought he would.
L565971 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Go out with DIFFERENT girls!
L565970 +++$+++ u8060 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ KELLO +++$+++ Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
L565969 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ He goes out with girls.
L565968 +++$+++ u8060 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ KELLO +++$+++ Is that a fact?  He's a dilly, ain't he?  By the by, what did he have against this boy?
L565963 +++$+++ u8060 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ KELLO +++$+++ ...And he's got them on him.  I appreciate a thing like that - I appreciate where you are looking out for the virtue of the city.
L565962 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ - He's got them on him.
L565961 +++$+++ u8060 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ KELLO +++$+++ It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...
L565956 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ He's leaving early.  After this "set".  He'll be out in a couple of minutes...
L565955 +++$+++ u8060 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ KELLO +++$+++ What's all the rush?  You said three o'clock.
L565404 +++$+++ u8060 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ KELLO +++$+++ I call him the boy with the ice cream face!
L565403 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I know...I know you're the strongest cop in town.
L565593 +++$+++ u8061 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.
L565592 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?
L565591 +++$+++ u8061 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No.  It's one of J.J.'s occasional beau gestes.  Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.
L565590 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Who put this item in about the comic?  "If there's a more hilarious funny man around than Herbie Temple at the Palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name.  We were too busy screaming." Does this Temple have a press agent?
L565586 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?
L565585 +++$+++ u8061 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Bribing me again?
L565579 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Dallas?  Could be.  He doesn't look like a reefer smoker...
L565578 +++$+++ u8061 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Could this be that boy?
L565574 +++$+++ u8061 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Something about a Frank D'Angelo trying to reach you...
L565573 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ What about?
L565572 +++$+++ u8061 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ That's a question I usually like to ask YOU.  Your secretary phoned.
L565551 +++$+++ u8062 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ - that's what I mean!
L565550 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Nothing I didn't think of you before.
L565549 +++$+++ u8062 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ What would you think of me if -
L565548 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!
L565547 +++$+++ u8062 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ A girl needs a little romancing before she -
L565544 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Listen, you need him for a favor, don't you!  And so do I!  I need his column--tonight.  Didn't you ask me to do something about your job?  Don't you have a kid in Military School?
L565543 +++$+++ u8062 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ This sort of thing!
L565542 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ What sort of thing?
L565541 +++$+++ u8062 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...
L565540 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I beg your pardon!  I turn myself inside out to help you and now I'm a heavy.  Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door!
L565539 +++$+++ u8062 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A tangerine that peels in a minute?
L565538 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ What kind of an act is this?
L565537 +++$+++ u8062 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...?  Where's my other shoe?
L565536 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ So take five minutes!  Get acquainted!  He's an important man - he's lonely - don't be dumb!
L565535 +++$+++ u8062 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ And he's a perfect stranger to me.
L565534 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Yeah!
L565533 +++$+++ u8062 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
L565532 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Don't you know who that man is?
L565526 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ One of those business meetings, honey - always coming up in the middle of the night.
L565525 +++$+++ u8062 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Back?
L565520 +++$+++ u8062 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Hello.
L565519 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.
L565251 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Can you be there by two-thirty?
L565250 +++$+++ u8062 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Do you still keep your key under the mat?
L565249 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...
L565248 +++$+++ u8062 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Do you think you could do something, Sidney?
L565245 +++$+++ u8062 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ But, Sidney darling, the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning!
L565244 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ We're old friends, Chickie - quit it!  A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter!  What did you think would happen in his house?
L565243 +++$+++ u8062 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.
L565242 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ And where was his wife?
L565241 +++$+++ u8062 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ In his apartment -
L565240 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ You were thrilled to be interviewed.  Were you "interviewed"?
L565239 +++$+++ u8062 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ ...cigarette girls... And naturally -
L565238 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?
L565237 +++$+++ u8062 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Staring.  Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn't surprised, but I didn't let on.
L565236 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Avidly.  He was staring.
L565234 +++$+++ u8062 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
L565233 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?
L565157 +++$+++ u8062 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ At the bar - Sidney...
L565156 +++$+++ u8065 +++$+++ m546 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Is Frank D'Angelo around?
