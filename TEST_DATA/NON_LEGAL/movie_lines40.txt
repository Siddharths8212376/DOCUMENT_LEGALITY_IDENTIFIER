L34947 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
L34946 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
L34945 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
L34944 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ What?
L34943 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ I want to be near you!
L34942 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ No.
L34941 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Don't you know?
L34940 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Why are you so anxious?
L34939 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
L34938 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
L34937 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
L34936 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
L34935 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Well, aren't you going to invite me?
L34934 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Well, what?
L34933 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Well—
L34932 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.
L34930 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight!
L34929 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Oh! Oh, no!  I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly.
L34911 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ See, we're getting along famously!
L34910 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
L34909 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Doesn't that come next?
L34907 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Now let me see, what comes next?  Oh yes, I know - what are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
L34906 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
L34905 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married.
L34904 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women.
L34903 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Line?
L34902 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
L34901 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
L34900 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ —running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
L34899 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ What is?
L34898 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks—
L34897 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Liar! You're just suffering from lack of sleep.
L34896 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Well, you can. You always could.
L34895 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
L34894 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
L34893 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Me?
L34892 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
L34891 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
L34887 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Why, I needed a—
L34886 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
L35101 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
L35100 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
L35099 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
L35098 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.
L35096 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ No?  Then maybe you'll understand, Mrs. Dickson. Oh, gee, he's crazy about you. Nobody knows it better than you. If he ever finds out, it'll kill him.
L35095 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion.
L35094 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
L35093 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ I'm not interested in what you think.
L35089 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson.
L35088 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.
L35086 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ It's funny - now that I'm here, I don't know just how to go about it.  You see, I kind of expected to find you here alone.
L35085 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ I'm listening.
L35084 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.
L35081 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Oh, yeah?
L35080 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
L35055 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Yes, now.
L35054 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Now?
L35053 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Let me see your cash book, will you?
L35052 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L35051 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
L35569 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
L35568 +++$+++ u290 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ GARDINER +++$+++ Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.
L35149 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Of course, let them in! You're late now.
L35148 +++$+++ u290 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ GARDINER +++$+++ Shall we let the people come in?
L34738 +++$+++ u290 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ GARDINER +++$+++ Thank you!
L34737 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
L34736 +++$+++ u290 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ GARDINER +++$+++ I'm feeling fine this morning.
L34735 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?
L34734 +++$+++ u290 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ GARDINER +++$+++ Excuse me—
L34733 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Got a handkerchief?
L34732 +++$+++ u290 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ GARDINER +++$+++ Much better this morning, thank you.
L34731 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ John, how's your wife this morning?
L34730 +++$+++ u290 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ GARDINER +++$+++ Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
L35471 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
L35470 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
L35469 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
L35468 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?
L35012 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ No.
L35011 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Happy now?
L35010 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
L35006 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Tomorrow night?
L35005 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
L35004 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Well . . .
L35003 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
L35002 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
L35001 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Ho! Ho! Ho!
L35000 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ The girls!  I don't suppose it ever occurred to you that I might go out and find myself an attractive young man . . .
L34999 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn—
L34998 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Yes, of course.
L34997 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
L34996 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ The theatre?
L34995 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
L34994 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
L34993 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
L34992 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
L34991 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all about you. I'm so sorry, dear.
L34990 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Yes.
L34989 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
L34988 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
L34987 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
L34970 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Oooh! That has the earmarks!
L34969 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
L34968 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!
L34967 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Hello, darling.
L34966 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
L35585 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.
L35584 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Oh!
L35578 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Say, I know what's the matter with you. Matt!
L35577 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Good morning.
L35576 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Good morning, Helen.
L35488 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Numbers? No, never mind.
L35487 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?
L35350 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L35349 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.
L35153 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Now don't you worry about it.
L35152 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ In Mr. Sampson's office.
L35151 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Where is he now?
L35150 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
L34926 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L34925 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
L34775 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
L34774 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Longer.
L34773 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Directors, eh? Long faces?
L34772 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
L34771 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?
L34770 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Why - well, I—
L34769 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
L34768 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I don't know.
L34767 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
L34766 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Good morning.
L35467 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone.
L35466 +++$+++ u293 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN'S VOICE +++$+++ Yes?
L35465 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Helen!
L35018 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ All right. Send him in.
L35017 +++$+++ u293 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN'S VOICE +++$+++ Mr. Sampson . . .
L35016 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Yes?
L34986 +++$+++ u293 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN'S VOICE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L34985 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
L34984 +++$+++ u293 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN'S VOICE +++$+++ Yes?
L34782 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
L34781 +++$+++ u301 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. PEMBROKE +++$+++ But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.
L34777 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
L34776 +++$+++ u301 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. PEMBROKE +++$+++ Mr. Dickson?
L34765 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Hello, Helen.
L34764 +++$+++ u301 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. PEMBROKE +++$+++ Yes, thank you.
L34763 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Got my letter?
L34762 +++$+++ u301 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. PEMBROKE +++$+++ Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
L34761 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
L35574 +++$+++ u295 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ JANITOR +++$+++ I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
L35573 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Looks good. How much did it cost?
L35572 +++$+++ u295 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ JANITOR +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L35571 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?
L34793 +++$+++ u295 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ JANITOR +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L34792 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Oh, make that uniform blue.
L34757 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ You see Sampson. Tell him I sent you. You've got to have a uniform.
L34756 +++$+++ u295 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ JANITOR +++$+++ Why, I don't know.
L34755 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
L34754 +++$+++ u295 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ JANITOR +++$+++ No, sir.
L34753 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ You haven't got a uniform?
L34752 +++$+++ u295 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ JANITOR +++$+++ I haven't any.
L34751 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
L35583 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson—
L35582 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.
L35581 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ I don't want to hear any more about it. If you don't get married, I'll fire both of you.
L35580 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ But I haven't . . .
L35579 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
L35505 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ All right. That's all.  Please, Matt.
L35504 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and—
L35503 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
L35502 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
L35501 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
L35500 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is—
L35499 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Was Mrs. Dickson there?
L35498 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
L35497 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Were you in Cluett's apartment?
L35496 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
L35495 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
L35494 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.
L35308 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were you last night?  Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don't you?
L35307 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
L35306 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ You're protecting somebody.
L35305 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ No. I won't.
L35303 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ I can't tell you.
L35302 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  Matt, do you realize you're up against something? You're being charged with murder. It's serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn't do it.  But we've got to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?
L35173 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ There you are.
L35172 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ I already told him I was home.
L34965 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
L34964 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Well, I—
L34963 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
L34962 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.
L34961 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Say, come on. Show a little enthusiasm. What's the matter? Are you sick or something? Go on, fake it - even if it isn't real.
L34960 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Sure, I think it's swell.
L34959 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
L34958 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  Not a bad thought, eh?
L34957 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ It's all right. Thanks.
L35464 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ You don't want to check up on anybody. I'll do all the checking up. Wait a minute.
L35463 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
L35462 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ You're lying!
L35457 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
L35456 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ My wife? What's she got to do with you?
