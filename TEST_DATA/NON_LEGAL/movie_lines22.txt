L12258 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I know who it is.
L12257 +++$+++ u146 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LUGENE +++$+++ Did you get his number?
L12256 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
L12255 +++$+++ u146 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LUGENE +++$+++ Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
L12844 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
L12843 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
L12842 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
L12841 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Going somewhere, Margie?
L12785 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
L12784 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
L12783 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
L12782 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
L12713 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
L12712 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ What happened?
L12582 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Wade.
L12581 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ This is nuts.
L12534 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I don't know for Christ's sake!
L12533 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ How?
L12532 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Of course! I would've heard.
L12531 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Think they're alright?
L12530 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Strange.
L12529 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
L12528 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
L12527 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
L12526 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ I know your parents.
L12525 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
L12524 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
L12516 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Good.
L12515 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Alright. I'll think about it.
L12514 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
L12513 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You've been married twice --
L12512 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I've been thinking about it, that's all.
L12511 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Oh, Wade.
L12510 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
L12509 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Then... I guess you have to.
L12508 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
L12507 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
L12506 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ It's nice.
L12505 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
L12504 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ What way?
L12503 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
L12502 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You knew me as a kid.
L12501 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I can see what you looked like as a kid.
L12499 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ But not now.
L12498 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
L12497 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
L12496 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
L12495 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
L12494 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
L12493 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
L12492 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
L12491 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Jack doesn't need money.
L12490 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Money.
L12489 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?
L12488 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
L12487 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ ...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
L12486 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
L12485 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
L12484 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
L12483 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
L12350 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Okay.
L12349 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Tonight. Let's get together.
L12348 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Call me.
L12344 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
L12343 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
L12342 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah. I mean that.
L12341 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You don't mean that.
L12340 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
L12339 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L12338 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Forget it.
L12337 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
L12336 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Said what?
L12335 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ I'm sorry about what I said.
L12334 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah.
L12333 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You okay?
L12233 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah.
L12232 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You okay?
L12231 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ See you tomorrow, maybe.
L12230 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
L12225 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off.
L12224 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Okay. She's fine.
L12223 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ How's she doing?
L12222 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ For a while.
L12221 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
L12564 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
L12563 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Can --?
L12562 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ It makes me sad.
L12555 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Is...? She's dead then?
L12554 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ When did she die?
L12553 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Coffee's perked.
L12550 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze.  Wade, would you do that?
L12549 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
L12548 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You're not using it today?
L12547 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ There's a furnace.
L12546 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
L12482 +++$+++ u148 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MEL GORDON +++$+++ You get the hell out of my house now, asshole. And know this -- you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call, and I'm pissed enough to do it now!
L12481 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yes. Here's your ticket.
L12480 +++$+++ u148 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MEL GORDON +++$+++ Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
L12479 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
L12478 +++$+++ u148 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MEL GORDON +++$+++ You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
L12477 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
L12476 +++$+++ u148 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MEL GORDON +++$+++ Hold on!
L12475 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
L12474 +++$+++ u148 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MEL GORDON +++$+++ Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
L12473 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
L12472 +++$+++ u148 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MEL GORDON +++$+++ What the hell are you talking about?
L12471 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
L12470 +++$+++ u148 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MEL GORDON +++$+++ I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
L12469 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ How's that?
L12468 +++$+++ u148 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MEL GORDON +++$+++ Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
L12467 +++$+++ u149 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MRS. GORDON +++$+++ Can't it wait, then?
L12466 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
L12465 +++$+++ u149 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MRS. GORDON +++$+++ Something about my father?
L12464 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
L12463 +++$+++ u149 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MRS. GORDON +++$+++ Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
L12462 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
L12461 +++$+++ u149 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MRS. GORDON +++$+++ He's asleep. We were up very late.
L12460 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
L12459 +++$+++ u149 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MRS. GORDON +++$+++ Who are you?
L12840 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ No, he's out now. Somewhere on the mountain. I'd stay away from him if I were you. He's real pissed.
L12839 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ He got his deer yet?
L12838 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
L12837 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ His office. You mean my old office.
L12836 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
L12832 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
L12831 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
L12358 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
L12357 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
L12356 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Where... how'd you hear that?
L12355 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ The other guy.
L12354 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Jack?
L12353 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
L12352 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
L12351 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You talked to Jack?
L12347 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Marg! You got orders!
L12346 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
L12345 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Marg!
L12331 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Aw, c'mon, I was only saying there's something wrong with "Home Made Cooking", that's all. The sign's fine. What it says is wrong.
L12330 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ This town sucks.
L12329 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
L12328 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
L12327 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
L12326 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What?
L12325 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ It don't look right.
L12229 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
L12228 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Take care, Wade.
L12864 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
L12863 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
L12862 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Crawl!
L12861 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
L12860 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You and me.
L12859 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Bang!
L12858 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah.
L12857 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Everything you know is from me.
L12856 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Call it what you want.
L12855 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Love! I'm made of love!
L12854 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
L12853 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally done it! Like a man done it. Done it right. I love you, you mean sonofabitch!
L12852 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
L12851 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
L12719 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
L12718 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Pop, for Christ's sake!
L12590 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
L12589 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
L12561 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
L12560 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
L12559 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ In the living room.
L12558 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Is there something wrong with the phone?
L12557 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
L12556 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah.
L12545 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ She's coming.
L12544 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Where's Ma?
L12542 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah.
L12541 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
L12540 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
L12539 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
L12538 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You remember Margie Fogg?
L12537 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Sleeping.
L12536 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
L12324 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ You no-good pup!
L12323 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Nothing.
L12322 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!
L12312 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Atta-go.
L12311 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Just do it.
L12310 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day.  Sally, turn off that TV!
L12309 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Rolfe.
L12771 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
L12770 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
L12769 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ For what?
L12768 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
L12727 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
L12726 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Wade, are you alright?
L12725 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.
L12649 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ That's what you think.
L12648 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
L12647 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Well, I never heard that one.
L12646 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
L12645 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
L12644 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
L12643 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
