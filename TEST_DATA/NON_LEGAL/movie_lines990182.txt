L431481 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not— I'm just— all mixed up... .
L431480 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ What are you crying for?
L431478 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ For— not being any help?
L431477 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ What for?
L431476 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ You're not sore at me?
L431475 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I got my whole life to drink.
L431474 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
L431473 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ You haven't finished your beer.
L431472 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
L431471 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I— I'd like to, Edie, but—  —there's nothin' I can do. Edie feels subdued, ashamed at breaking down. She rises, and in a low voice says—
L431469 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Why keep harpin' on it?  Come on, drink up. You got to get a little fun out of life. What's the matter with you?  I'll play you some music.
L431468 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Like Joey? Are you afraid to mention his name?
L431466 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ But that's living like an animal—
L431465 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
L431464 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ And if you don't?
L431463 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Edie, down here it's every man for himself. It's keepin' alive! It's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket.
L431462 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ You don't believe in anything, do you?
L431461 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ But a priest...?
L431460 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.
L431459 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ His— racket?
L431458 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Yeah, yeah... .  This Father Barry, what's his racket?
L431457 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
L431456 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.
L431455 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Why, Terry, who said it was?
L431454 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Listen— get this straight— don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn't my idea... .
L431453 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ And when things get in your way— or people —you just knock them aside— get rid of Them— is that your idea?
L431452 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ What do they do for you, except get in your way?
L431451 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or— or human kindness in your whole body.
L431450 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I'm not lookin' to get crucified. I'm lookin' to stay in one piece.
L431449 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Our Lord said just the opposite.
L431448 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
L431447 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Terry!
L431446 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts!  You really believe that drool?
L431445 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
L431444 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ What a fruitcake you are!
L431443 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Shouldn't we care about everybody?
L431442 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old man got killed—never mind how. Charley and I was put in a place—they called it a Children's Home. Some home! I run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers and—  But what am I runnin' off at the mouth for? What do you care?
L431441 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ What made you want to be a fighter?
L431440 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere.  Miss Four Corners.
L431439 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Now what are you doing?
L431438 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Naw, in the ring, a dive is-
L431437 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ A dive? You mean, into the water?
L431436 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But— I didn't stay in shape— and—  —I had to take a few dives.
L431435 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Were you really a prize fighter?
L431432 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Hit me again, Mac.
L431431 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ No thanks... .
L431430 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ How about another one?
L431429 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ It's quite—  –nice.
L431428 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ How do you like it?
L431427 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Wham... .
L431425 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ I am?
L431424 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Likewise. And draw two for chasers.  Now you're beginning to live.
L431416 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Come on, I know a quiet one, with a special entrance for ladies... .
L431415 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ In a saloon?
L431414 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Want to go out and have one with me?
L431413 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ I don't know.
L431412 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Listen, you like beer?
L431408 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ One thing about them though, they're faithful. They get married just like people.
L431407 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
L431406 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ If another fella tries to take that perch away from him, he lets him have it.
L431401 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Oh she's a beauty.
L431400 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ How do you like that one?
L431399 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ The things that go on.
L431398 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.
L431397 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested —in pigeons.
L431396 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.
L431395 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ That was nice of you.
L431394 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ He had a few birds.  I got up and fed 'em this morning.
L431393 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons.
L431392 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Here they come! The champion flock of the neighborhood.
L431390 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I started them Golden Warriors. I was their first Supreme Commander.
L431389 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ The Golden Warriors.
L431388 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Good. So do I.
L431387 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.
L431356 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ I really don't know.
L431355 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I don't know.
L431354 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ What for?
L431353 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?
L431352 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Thanks anyway.
L431351 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I only live up there and across the roof.
L431350 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ I'd better go in.
L431349 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ That's my own flock up there, getting their evening workout. I won plenty of races with 'em.  Listen, you want to see them? Come up on the roof with me and I'll show 'em to you.
L431348 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Do you like pigeons?
L431347 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Boy, they sure fly nice, don't they?
L431346 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Well he played it smart. Too many good-for-nothin's around here. All they got on their mind's a little beer, a little pool, a little—  I better get you home.
L431345 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd— get into bad company.
L431344 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
L431343 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ What?
L431342 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
L431341 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ What's that?
L431340 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ With a little more patience and kindness. That's what makes people mean and difficult. Nobody cares enough about them.
L431339 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ How would you've done it?
L431338 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
L431337 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Now you got me! It's a wonder I wasn't punchy by the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used to whack me with!  They thought they could beat an education into me—I foxed 'em.
L431336 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ I remember you were in trouble all the time.
L431335 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
L431334 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ The moment I saw you.
L431333 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?
L431332 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ I can get home all right from here—
L431331 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Man, you were a mess!
L431330 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
L431329 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were—
L431328 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ In braids? That's right.
L431327 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Yeah. Yeah. I get your thought. You know I seen you lots of times before. Parochial school on Pulaski Street? Seven, eight years ago? Your hair come down in—
L431326 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ It isn't brains. It's how you use them.
L431325 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ A teacher! Dong!!!  You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. He's very brainy. Very.
L431324 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ I want to be a teacher.
L431323 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ And you spend all your time just learning stuff, huh?
L431322 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.
L431321 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ You training to be a nun or something?
L431320 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ You know how the Sisters are.
L431318 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ I better get home.
L431317 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
L431316 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
L431315 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Everybody knew him. He got around.
L431314 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Everybody loved Joey. From the little kids to the old rummies.  Did you know him very well?
L431306 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I better see you get there.
L431305 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ I'll get home all right now.
L431304 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I'm with Terry.
L431303 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Which side are you with?
L431302 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ They play pretty rough.
L431301 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
L431300 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I think we're O.K.
L431213 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Things 're lookin' up on the docks, huh, Jackie?
L431212 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ None of your business.
L431211 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ What makes him so special?
L431210 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Give it to me— my Pop's job—
L431209 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Oh, I thought you was gonna go to work— with all them muscles. 
L431966 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Let me by.
L431965 +++$+++ u6965 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Where you goin'?
L431381 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Pop!
L431380 +++$+++ u6965 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ You are like—
L431379 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for all you've done to get me an education and shelter me from this.  But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren't living? I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep on trying to find out who's guilty for Joey. I'd walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I thought they could help me. I tell you I'm staying, Pop. Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers.
L431378 +++$+++ u6965 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ See this arm? It's two inches longer 'n the other one. That's years of workin' and sweatin', liftin' and swingin' a hook. And every time I heisted a box or a coffee bag I says to myself—this is for Edie, so she can be a teacher or somethin' decent. I promised your mother. You better not let her down.
L431377 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.
L431376 +++$+++ u6965 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
L431375 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ He wanted to see me again.
L431374 +++$+++ u6965 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
L431373 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .
L431372 +++$+++ u6965 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother, here we go again. You think he's one of those cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry for. Like the litter of kittens you had—the only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little Abyssinian... .
L431371 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
L431370 +++$+++ u6965 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
L431369 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
L431368 +++$+++ u6965 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Who is he! Edie, you're so softhearted and soft-headed you wouldn't recognize the devil if he had you by the throat. You know who this Terry Malloy is? The kid brother of Charlie the Gent, Johnny Friendly's right hand, a butcher in a camel hair coat.
L431367 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Who is he, Pop?
L431366 +++$+++ u6965 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters, and to keep you from things like I just seen out the window. My own daughter arm-in-arm with Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?
L431365 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
L431364 +++$+++ u6965 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ You're all packed.  And here's your bus ticket. You're on your way back to St. Anne's.
L431991 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I can? Okay.  Okay...
L431990 +++$+++ u6954 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ FATHER BARRY +++$+++ You can!
L431984 +++$+++ u6954 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ FATHER BARRY +++$+++ Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.
L431983 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ ...walk?
L431868 +++$+++ u6954 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ FATHER BARRY +++$+++ A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley— and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom— with the truth as you know it—  Truth is the gun— Drop that thing and tell the truth— a more dangerous weapon than this little —  —cap pistol.
L431867 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Take your hands off me. What you call me?
L431864 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ You go to—
L431863 +++$+++ u6954 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ FATHER BARRY +++$+++ What did you say?
L431862 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ You go to hell.
L431861 +++$+++ u6954 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ FATHER BARRY +++$+++ Give me that gun.
L431860 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Why don't you go and chase yourself?
L431859 +++$+++ u6954 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ FATHER BARRY +++$+++ This is my business.
L431858 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Mind your own business, Father.
L431857 +++$+++ u6954 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ FATHER BARRY +++$+++ Your gun.
L431856 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ What do you want from me, Father.
L431855 +++$+++ u6954 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ FATHER BARRY +++$+++ Now don't give me a hard time.
L431854 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
L431853 +++$+++ u6954 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ FATHER BARRY +++$+++ I want to see you, Terry.

L431628 +++$+++ u6954 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ FATHER BARRY +++$+++ Good luck.
L431627 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
L431626 +++$+++ u6954 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ FATHER BARRY +++$+++ Ball games! Don't break my heart! I wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds. So you got a brother. Well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers— and they're all getting the short end while your cousin Johnny gets mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was you—  — Listen, I'm not asking you to do anything, Terry. It's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.
L431625 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ But it's my own brother they're askin' me to finger— and Johnny Friendly. His mother and my mother was first cousins. When I was this high he took me to the ball games... .

L431618 +++$+++ u6954 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ FATHER BARRY +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L431617 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ —It started as a favor— for my brother— you know they'd ask me things and it's hard to say no— a favor— Who am I kiddin'? They call it a favor but it's do it or else. And this time the favor turned out to be helping them knock off Joey. I just thought they'd lean on him a little but— Last night with Edie I wanted to tell her only it— stuck in my throat. I guess I was scared of drivin' her away— and I love her, Father. She's the first thing I ever loved.

L431612 +++$+++ u6954 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ FATHER BARRY +++$+++ Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
L431611 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I don't get it!
L431610 +++$+++ u6954 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ FATHER BARRY +++$+++ I don't want to hear it in there.
L431609 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ But you're the one I want to tell— what you said over Nolan— about keepin' silent when you know the score— I'm guilty— you hear me? I'm guilty... .
L431608 +++$+++ u6954 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ FATHER BARRY +++$+++ Someone else c'n take your confession.
L431607 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ What's the matter? I've got something That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.
