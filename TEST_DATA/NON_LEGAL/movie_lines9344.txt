L458438 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?

L458430 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
L458429 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
L458428 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
L458427 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
L458426 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
L458425 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ 'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
L458424 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there.
L458423 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Nah, not now... I wanna wait. I don't feel right...
L458422 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
L458421 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ How do you know? You know her that good?
L458420 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.

L458415 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
L458414 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Whadda you care?
L458413 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Who's that?
L458409 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
L458408 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
L458407 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...
L458406 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he think he is? I'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.
L458403 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Don't ever bring those kids up here again! I'm working out, I'm killin' myself in here, and they walk around like they fuckin' own the neighborhood.
L458402 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
L458401 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Answer me when I talk to you.
L458397 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.
L458396 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
L458395 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Go ahead.
L458394 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Jack! Enough!
L458393 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Harder.  Take the towel off.
L458389 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Here's your glove.
L458388 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Jack, I got no gloves.
L458387 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
L458386 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
L458385 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You heard me, I said hit me.
L458384 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ You want me to do what?
L458383 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Hit me in the face.
L458382 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Sure. What is it?
L458381 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Yeah. Do me a favor.
L458380 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ You know?
L458379 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
L458378 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ That's what I'm sayin'. You shouldn't even think like that. It's crazy.
L458376 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ What're you talking about? He's a heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
L458375 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
L458374 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
L458373 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Nothing...
L458372 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ What's wrong?
L458937 +++$+++ u2565 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ REPORTER +++$+++ What do you think of Jake's retirement, Mrs. LaMotta?
L458936 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Ain't she beautiful? Coulda been Mrs. America if I didn't pull her outa the contest. Didn't want her wearing a swimsuit for nobody but me.
L458935 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Why should I be bitter? Boxing's been good to me. I got a nice house, three kids, a beautiful wife -- take a picture of her. Vickie.
L458934 +++$+++ u2565 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ REPORTER +++$+++ You sound bitter.
L458933 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
L458932 +++$+++ u2565 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ REPORTER +++$+++ Does that mean...
L458931 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight.
L458522 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I tell you what. You hit me here.  Sugar Ray hits me here.  I can't tell the difference. I just fight.
L458521 +++$+++ u2565 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ REPORTER +++$+++ You just fought Sugar Ray two weeks ago and you're training like this right now... Are you afraid Sugar Ray might beat you this time?
L458518 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You guys know more about that than I do. I just fight...
L458517 +++$+++ u2565 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ REPORTER +++$+++ Well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in New York. And they're saying that you don't cooperate.
L458516 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Why not? There's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid. I don't see why I shouldn't have a shot at the title right now.
L458513 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Maybe it wasn't you, but you know what I'm talkin' about.
L458512 +++$+++ u2565 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ REPORTER +++$+++ Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
L458511 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I'm tellin' you now, when I read this, it better not make me look bad.
L458925 +++$+++ u2568 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points.
L458924 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down.
L458893 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Are you outa your mind? If I come out, I'll lose the title.
L458892 +++$+++ u2568 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ I'll give you anything you want, Jake. I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.
L458891 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. Just a chip of ice.
L458890 +++$+++ u2568 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Three more, I figure.
L458889 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ How many pounds I gotta lose?
L458888 +++$+++ u2568 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Yeah. At night.
L458887 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ At night?
L458886 +++$+++ u2568 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Nine o'clock.
L458885 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What time is it?
L458884 +++$+++ u2568 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.
L458717 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
L458716 +++$+++ u2568 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!
L458996 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What friends?
L458995 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ Can't you get the money from your friends?
L458994 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Don't make no difference no more.
L458993 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
L458992 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
L458991 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ But they don't have a case against you.
L458990 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.
L458989 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ What are you doing?
L458988 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ All right, just don't make any noise.
L458987 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
L458986 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ The kids are sleeping.
L458984 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ No. Open the door.
L458983 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ Are you drunk?
L458982 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
L458965 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.
L458964 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Aw, c'mon, Vick --
L458963 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
L458962 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
L458961 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
L458960 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Open the door, Vickie.
L458959 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
L458958 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Sure, what else is new?
L458957 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ I'm leaving you Jake.
L458956 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
L458912 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Ok, all right. Telephone's in the hall. Dial his number.
L458911 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
L458910 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I dunno.
L458909 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ Why don't you just call him?
L458908 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
L458904 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ I don't know.
L458903 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Then what?
L458902 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ No, not that.
L458901 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
L458900 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ Why don't you just call him up?
L458899 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ OK. Talk.
L458898 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
L458897 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What?
L458896 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ Jake --
L458895 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out.
L458894 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ Jake, why don't you just try lying down and get some rest.
L458883 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Yeah --
L458882 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?
L458878 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ You're not only an animal, you're a stupid animal.  You're rotten.  Rotten.  Rotten.  You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You belong in a mental hospital.
L458877 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You're the fuckin' animal! You ran around with every guy I knew while I was breakin' my ass for you.
L458876 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ Nothing is what I said! Go on, kill me.  Kill me.  I'm not afraid of you anymore. I don't care if you kill me like you're killing him. You're a sick animal.
L458875 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
L458874 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
L458868 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ Yeah, I sucked his cock.
L458867 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You did?

L458860 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ I went with Sandy and Vera. Salvy was there.  Stop it. I just had a drink, that's all. I didn't do anything wrong. 
L458859 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ With Salvy, eh?
L458858 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ I didn't do anything wrong. I swear. I just had a few drinks.
L458857 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Do I have to kill you, eh?  Do I have to kill somebody to get an answer?  I know about you at the Copa. I know all about it.
L458856 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ Jake, no --
L458855 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What do I have to do to get a straight answer around here.
L458854 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ I am answering...
L458853 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
L458852 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ What're you talking about?
L458851 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
L458850 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
L458849 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What was it about?
L458848 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ "Father of the Bride."
L458847 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What'd you see?
L458846 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ I went to the movies.
L458845 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What'd you see?
L458844 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ I got bored so I went to the movies.
L458843 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I called. You weren't there.
L458842 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ I took the kids to my sister's.

L458788 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help.
L458787 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ What's the matter with you?
L458763 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ Jake...

L458761 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ But Jake... I didn't say anything...
L458759 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ You're hurting my arm.
L458758 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
L458757 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ All I did...
L458756 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
L458755 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ What did I do?
L458754 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.
L458617 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You're the one who said he was good looking. You think he's good looking 'cause I know you think he's good- looking. I'll smash his face inside out. I'll make him into dog meat. Nobody's gonna think he's good-looking when I get through with him. So you just go ahead and think about who you want.
L458616 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ Positive.
L458615 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
L458614 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ I never noticed his face.
L458613 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ That he's got a pretty face.
L458612 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ What did I say?
L458611 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
L458610 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ Nobody. I love you, remember?
L458609 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
L458608 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ Yeah, what?
L458607 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Huh?
L458606 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L458605 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You asleep?
L458604 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ What?
L458603 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?
L458580 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Look at this, all of a sudden everybody's a fuckin' Romeo around here. Did you see the way she was lookin' at him?
L458579 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
L458578 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
L458577 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ No, I'm not.
L458576 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You're not interested in him?
L458575 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ I'm not interested in him.
L458574 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
L458573 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
L458572 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him?
L458564 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Who asked you?
L458563 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ I was just...
