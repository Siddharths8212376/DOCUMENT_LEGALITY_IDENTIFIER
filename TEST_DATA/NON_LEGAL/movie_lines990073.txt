L342491 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Yes, miss.
L342490 +++$+++ u6277 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ We leave in the morning?!
L342489 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ My God, you've grown up.
L342949 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
L342948 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Where will we go?
L342944 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ I have nothing to go back for.
L342943 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Will you go back to England?
L342939 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Alice?
L342938 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ And my compliments to you...
L342897 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ ...never doubt what you are doing.
L342896 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Listen. Submit. You hear me?  You're strong. You stay alive. I will find you...  no matter how far, how long it takes...
L342892 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Yes. I want you to go.
L342891 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them.  Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?
L342884 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Our father? Did you see my father?
L342883 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Maybe...
L342882 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Are we safe?
L342782 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.
L342781 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ What is it?
L342778 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Do not.  Promise me.
L342777 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ No. I will find you.
L342776 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.  If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If that happens, stay close to your father.  The French will protect the officer class among the English.
L342775 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ What would you have me do?
L342774 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Because what I am interested in is right here...
L342773 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
L342683 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
L342682 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
L342680 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Miss.  May I?
L342679 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Mr Poe?
L342599 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.
L342598 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Much further?
L342597 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring...  to my blood...  ...than any imagining could possibly have been...
L342596 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Sorry to disappoint you...
L342595 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London...
L342593 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ 'Cos frontier land's the only land affordable to poor people. So after seven years indentured service in Virginia, they headed out here where they are beholden to none and not livin' by another's leave...  Their name was Cameron. John & Alexandria.
L342592 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
L342591 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
L342590 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
L342589 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
L342588 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ How did you learn English?
L342587 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I do not remember them. I was one or two.
L342586 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L342585 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own.
L342583 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Thank you so much.
L342582 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
L342581 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ "We're a breed apart and we make no sense"...?
L342580 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Why did they turn back?
L342579 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ The Ottawa are gone.
L342578 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Yes. And "do not try to understand them.  That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense..."
L342577 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ What?!
L342576 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
L342575 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ He did?
L342574 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
L342573 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Your "father"?
L342572 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Well that is to be expected. My father...
L342571 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.
L342570 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ You knew them.
L342569 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
L342568 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Why didn't you bury those people?
L342566 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ I will not. I have seen the face of war before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on women and children. And almost as cruel is your indifference.
L342565 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Let us go, miss.
L342564 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!
L342771 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
L342770 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ You do not know what you are saying!
L342769 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ "Justice"?  If that's "justice"..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people.
L342768 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ But the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon.
L342760 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ He knew the consequences. And he stayed.  Are those the actions of a criminal?  ...Duncan, do something.
L342759 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room, in my presence. He is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children.
L342628 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ I sent three men to Webb!
L342627 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ There was no letter.
L342626 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ What?
L342625 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ There was none!
L342624 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ My letter...
L342623 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ When? How?
L342622 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Told you to stay away from this hell hole!  Why did you disobey me?
L342937 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
L342936 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ ... compliments, Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out.
L342890 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ What the bloody hell plan is this?
L342889 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Yes. Go ahead.
L342766 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
L342765 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ They do not live their lives "by your leave."  ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way.
L342762 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...
L342761 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.  He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
L342719 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests.
L342718 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ beyond the periphery of men, staring at him.
L342710 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ I am sorry, Duncan...
L342709 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ I see...
L342707 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
L342706 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
L342630 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ He delivered no such message.
L342629 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ One called Magua arrived.
L342494 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ It can be dangerous...
L342493 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ My God, Alice.
L342487 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Yes. Yes, I will.
L342486 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Will you consider that?
L342485 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you. In view of your indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine?
L342484 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
L342483 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ "Some"?
L342482 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Some say that's the way of it.
L342481 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
L342480 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?
L342478 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Aversion?  No... "Hatred"... "Loathing"...
L342477 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ You still have an aversion to the water?
L342476 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ And by sea!
L342475 +++$+++ u6278 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive... after so long apart and after you've traveled so far...
L342881 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ : Only one or two loads.
L342880 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Any powder?
L342879 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
L342878 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ And if we're unlucky?
L342877 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.
L342876 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Then what?
L342875 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
L342874 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ I don't understand!
L342873 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ We don't.
L342872 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Where do we go from here?
L342869 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Do you hear me, sir!  If you ever fall... into British hands...  What white water?
L342868 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Head for... for the white water.
L342865 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Only chance we got is...  ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground!
L342864 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ How long?
L342735 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Major!  Some day I think you and I are gonna have a serious disagreement.
L342734 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
L342733 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ That is the truth!
L342732 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ That is sedition! Treason!
L342731 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!
L342558 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Excuse me...
L342557 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Ottawa!
L342556 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Who were these people?
L342552 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Do not let gratitude get in the way...
L342551 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!
L342548 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ England does not protect me and does not war against France on our account. She uses us to war against France on her own account...  of greed for land and furs.
L342547 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France?
L342546 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I ain't your "scout". And I am in no damn militia.
L342545 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ I thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia?
L342544 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
L342543 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Fort Edward, then?
L342542 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ No.
L342541 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
L342540 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
L342539 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
L342538 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
L342537 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
L342536 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Dark haired...
L342535 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ What?!
L342534 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?
L342533 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
L342532 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
L342531 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ How far is it, scout?
L342527 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ ...Fort William Henry.
L342526 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ We were headed...
L342525 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.
L342438 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ ...No...Do not call myself much of a subject at all.
L342437 +++$+++ u6282 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
L342436 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You do what you want with your own scalp.  Do not be tellin' us what to do with ours.
L342433 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ ... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?
L342432 +++$+++ u6282 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ Will you men help us stop the French?
L342431 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio.  Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands...
L342430 +++$+++ u6282 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?
L342429 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
L342428 +++$+++ u6282 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ What did you say?
L342427 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Your enemy...
L342426 +++$+++ u6282 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy.
L342749 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ It does and it is a better lookin' reason than you, Jack Winthrop.  Push hard, 'cos you got to clear the French outpost by dawn.  Good luck, Jack.
L342748 +++$+++ u6281 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
L342747 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Got a reason to stay.
L342746 +++$+++ u6281 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You're not coming with us?
L342745 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I'll cover them from the top of the casement.
L342742 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line. Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast and fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers...
L342741 +++$+++ u6281 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over us is tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.  No force on earth will keep me here... Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each man make your own decision... Those who are goin', be back here in an hour.
L342409 +++$+++ u6281 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ We'll see in the morning...
L342408 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
L342407 +++$+++ u6281 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.
L342406 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ So what is it, Jack? What brings you up here?
L342404 +++$+++ u6281 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Tradin' your skins in Castleton?
L342403 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out.
L342928 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man?  Would the Huron have greed for more land than a man can use? Like Francais Black Robes do?  Would Huron kill tribes with disease? Would the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the animals in the forest for beads & brandy? But sell the fur to the white man for gold?...  Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les Francais masters. Are they the ways of Huron men who hunt & work the land? Or of dogs?  ...Magua's heart is twisted. He would make himself into what twisted him. A Dog, become Master of Dogs. But are Hurons dogs?  ...Magua's way is false. It is like the white sickness. Magua's way will bring only sadness and shame. Is there another way? I don't know.  I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese; Hawkeye, adopted son of Chingachgook, of the Mohican people... Let the children of the dead Munro go free... I speak the truth.
L342927 +++$+++ u6283 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MAGUA +++$+++ The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.
L342926 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Magua would use the ways of Les Francais and the Yengeese...
L342925 +++$+++ u6283 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MAGUA +++$+++ No.  Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites.
L342924 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ So the Huron are the servants of the French?  To do what the French are shamed to do?
L342922 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Wise one, the French fathers made peace and swore to their honor not to break the friendship. Magua broke it. It is false that the French would not be friends, still, to the Huron.
L342921 +++$+++ u6283 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MAGUA +++$+++ Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger.
L342920 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.
L342725 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ You forget yourself!
L342724 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
L342723 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ I'll have none of that!  Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.
L342717 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ What did you see, Major?
L342716 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.
L342657 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ That's all, sir.
L342656 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Many men here, their homes are in the path.
L342654 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ It was a war party. It means they're on the attack up and down the frontier.
L342653 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Poe? So?
L342647 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ ...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
L342646 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
L342637 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ What else?
L342636 +++$+++ u6279 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
L342469 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ By your leave, sir.
L342468 +++$+++ u6288 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ WEBB +++$+++ The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way.
L342467 +++$+++ u6288 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ WEBB +++$+++ Yes. You may.  You there. What does Munro call you?  The "Scotsman" has sent one of his Indian allies to guide you.
L342466 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
L342465 +++$+++ u6288 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ WEBB +++$+++ You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
L342464 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ I thought British policy is 'Make the World... England', sir.
