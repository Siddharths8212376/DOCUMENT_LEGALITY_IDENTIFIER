L108823 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
L108822 +++$+++ u4224 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ OPERATOR/PHONE +++$+++ One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
L108821 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
L108820 +++$+++ u4224 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ OPERATOR/PHONE +++$+++ Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
L108819 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Paris?
L108818 +++$+++ u4224 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ OPERATOR/PHONE +++$+++ 
L108817 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ ...yes -- oui -- uh...
L108843 +++$+++ u4221 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MANAGER/PHONE +++$+++ I think not...  No, I'm sorry.  It was very sudden. He was here very briefly.
L108842 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
L108841 +++$+++ u4221 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MANAGER/PHONE +++$+++ It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.
L108840 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Right.  Yes.  Of course.
L108839 +++$+++ u4221 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MANAGER/PHONE +++$+++ His brother.  You know his brother?
L108838 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Who?  Who came?
L108837 +++$+++ u4221 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MANAGER/PHONE +++$+++ ...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
L108836 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ ...I understand...
L108835 +++$+++ u4221 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MANAGER/PHONE +++$+++ There was an accident.  On the motorway.  Apparently, he was killed instantly.  Really, I'm terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this...
L108834 +++$+++ u4221 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MANAGER/PHONE +++$+++ I have some very bad news for you, sir.  I'm terrible sorry to have to tell you this, but Monsieur Kane has passed away almost two weeks ago...
L108833 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Yes.
L108832 +++$+++ u4221 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MANAGER/PHONE +++$+++ You are a friend of his?
L108831 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Yes.  Is he there?
L108830 +++$+++ u4221 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MANAGER/PHONE +++$+++ You call about Monsieur Kane?  John Michael Kane?
L108829 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Yes, I'm here...
L108828 +++$+++ u4221 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MANAGER/PHONE +++$+++ Bonjour?  Monsieur?  Allo...
L108958 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ That'd be great.
L108957 +++$+++ u4226 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ RAWLINS +++$+++ Let me get you a new copy of the proposal.
L108956 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I hadn't heard.
L108955 +++$+++ u4226 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ RAWLINS +++$+++ We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.  Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
L108954 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Excuse me?
L108953 +++$+++ u4226 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ RAWLINS +++$+++ Was it the break-in?
L108952 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Okay.
L108951 +++$+++ u4226 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ RAWLINS +++$+++ We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
L108950 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Yes.
L108949 +++$+++ u4226 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ RAWLINS +++$+++ Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better.  I'm assuming you're still in the market.  It's the same vessel?
L108948 +++$+++ u4226 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ RAWLINS +++$+++ Well, I mean it's a tough business, isn't it?  Cutthroat.
L108947 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Did you?
L108946 +++$+++ u4226 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ RAWLINS +++$+++ We thought you were gone for good.
L108945 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Really.
L108944 +++$+++ u4226 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ RAWLINS +++$+++ Well...  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.
L108943 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Thanks.
L108942 +++$+++ u4226 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ RAWLINS +++$+++ Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.
L109145 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Not really.
L109144 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ You have ID?
L109143 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Think I could rent a scooter?
L109142 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Yes.
L109141 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ This your store?
L109140 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Can I help you?
L109114 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I'm gonna find the end of this.  I can't protect you.
L109113 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ What about you?
L109112 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I can't protect you anymore.
L109111 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ What was I thinking, right?
L109110 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ If you're lucky.  Take it.  There's enough in there to make a life.  Any life.  Just get out now. Get low.  Stay low.  <u>Take it</u>.
L109109 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ And that's it?

L109040 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ You could do that?
L109039 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all that matters.  We have this money.  We have what we have.  I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but...  I say we leave here.  We leave this place.  We go until we can't go anymore.
L108993 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Go back to the hotel.
L108992 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ <u>So what are we doing</u>?
L108991 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I don't know. 
L108990 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
L108989 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane. 
L108988 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ What is that?
L108987 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Nykwana Wombosi. 
L108986 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ -- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
L108960 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone.
L108959 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ I found it.  It took six calls.  I found Kane.  I found the body.
L108919 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ It's a company... MPG Capital.
L108918 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Who paid the bill?
L108917 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--
L108893 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I don't know what happened!  I don't know who he is!  I don't know what he wants!  I don't even know who I am!  The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find out!
L108892 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ -- we'll tell them what happened --
L108891 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ -- forget it --

L108887 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ -- there's no time --
L108886 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ But the police --
L108885 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
L108884 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Oh, Jesus...
L108883 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
L108882 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
L108881 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I didn't know this would happen.
L108880 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
L108879 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ You're wrong.  I didn't know.
L108878 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ I trusted you.
L108877 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ No.
L108876 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ You knew he was coming.
L108875 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ -- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
L108874 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ He came to kill us.
L108873 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ -- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
L108872 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
L108871 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
L108870 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ He's dead isn't he?
L108866 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ -- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture --  -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --

L108864 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ -- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
L108863 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
L108862 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ -- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
L108861 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ -- just --
L108860 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ ...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
L108859 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ What? -- what? --  -- what is it?
L108858 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ ...omigod, no...
L108857 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
L108854 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
L108853 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ -- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!

L108814 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Go ahead.
L108813 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
L108812 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
L108811 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ This is your office?  God, you live like a monk...
L108809 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I guess so.
L108808 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ This is like a real apartment.  This is really yours?
L108799 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.
L108798 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
L108797 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
L108796 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ You got me pretty fucking curious.
L108795 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Look, I don't know what's up there.
L108794 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Anytime.
L108793 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Thanks for the ride.
L108792 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Okay, so...
L108790 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Jason...
L108789 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I don't remember any of this.
L108788 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ I should go.
L108787 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I guess.
L108786 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ So this is it, right?
L108785 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
L108784 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Where?
L108783 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ No.  No.  Go around.  Keep going...
L108782 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Looks familiar?
L108781 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Four-fifty.  That's the address...
L108780 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ That's it?  Is that it?
L108779 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Slow down.  No, don't stop.  Just...
L108764 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I thought about it.  I don't know.
L108763 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ You ever think maybe you have a family?
L108762 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I dream I'm asleep.  I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up.  I don't think I smoke.
L108761 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ You were tired.  Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast.  So what do you dream about?
L108760 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I can't believe I slept.
L108759 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ We're about an hour away.
L108758 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Where are we?
L108757 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ I needed a break.
L108742 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ You're paranoid.  You were shot. It's natural.
L108741 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
L108740 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ People do amazing things when they're scared.
L108739 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
L108738 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
L108737 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
L108736 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Okay, so you're a victim.
L108735 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I was shot twice in the back.
L108734 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
L108733 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I don't know.
L108732 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L108731 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ -- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.
L108730 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ -- you could put it together --
L108729 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
L108728 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
L108727 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Nothing.  It's just not there.
L108726 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
L108725 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ No.
L108724 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?
L108719 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ 
L108718 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ That's what I'm saying.
L108717 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
L108716 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Look, go ahead...put the radio on...
L108715 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ What?  Like amnesia?
L108714 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.
L108713 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
L108712 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I don't know.  I don't know who I am.
L108711 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?
L108710 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Listen to what you want.
L108709 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ What does that mean?
L108708 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I don't know.
L108707 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
L108706 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
L108705 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
L108704 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I know that.
L108703 +++$+++ u4222 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.
L108701 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Then I'll find another ride.
