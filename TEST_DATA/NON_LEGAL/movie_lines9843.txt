L229994 +++$+++ u5447 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night.
L230520 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You're not making sense. Make sense.
L230519 +++$+++ u5448 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ FIRST MAN +++$+++ Did you see the winning run score?
L230518 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Of course I saw it.
L230513 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yes. What are you implying?
L230512 +++$+++ u5448 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ FIRST MAN +++$+++ What are we talking about?
L230511 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L230510 +++$+++ u5448 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ FIRST MAN +++$+++ I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend.
L230504 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Classic.
L230503 +++$+++ u5448 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ FIRST MAN +++$+++ Unbelievable.
L230502 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Great game.
L230368 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ This could be it.
L230367 +++$+++ u5449 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ This could be it.
L230366 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Does what feel comfortable?
L230365 +++$+++ u5449 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Does it feel comfortable?
L230364 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ This could be it.
L230363 +++$+++ u5449 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ This could be it.
L230362 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ This could be it.
L230361 +++$+++ u5449 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ This could be it.
L230200 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ This could be it.
L230199 +++$+++ u5449 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ This could Pbe it.
L230179 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Let's work on it.
L230178 +++$+++ u5449 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Let's work on it.
L230177 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ This could be it.
L230176 +++$+++ u5449 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ This could be it.
L229947 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ He will absolutely hate it.
L229946 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ They'll lose because they're my team.
L229945 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ It's your best play, Nicky.
L229944 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
L229943 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.
L229942 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
L229941 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
L229940 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ We don't even like each other, do we?
L229939 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Because we're completely mismatched.
L229938 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ In and out of bed.
L229937 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ We're able to surprise each other.
L229936 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ This is how we've managed to last.
L229935 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done.
L229933 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ It can't be all that personal.
L229932 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
L229931 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
L229930 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ The Red Sox
L229929 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ What?
L229928 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
L229927 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.
L229926 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
L229925 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
L229924 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ About what?
L229923 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
L229922 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
L229921 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
L229920 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Can he get through it?
L229919 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
L229918 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Our Peter?
L229917 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
L229916 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I talked to her two days ago.
L229915 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ She died.
L229914 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ She's dying.
L229913 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ What about her?
L229912 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You know about Adele.
L229911 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
L229910 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I hear Alan's sick.
L229909 +++$+++ u5450 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
L230572 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Daddy, wait.
L230571 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor.
L230569 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ There's nothing left for me to lie about.
L230568 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Will I believe you when you tell me something?
L230567 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Everything.
L230566 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ What will we talk about?
L230564 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'll see you all the time. I'll get a place right nearby. One room. No distractions. We'll talk.
L230563 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Except I won't have a father anymore.
L230562 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around.
L230227 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ I'm not sure.
L230226 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
L230225 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ I have a class. I'm late.
L230224 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.
L230223 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ I don't have a date. I don't want a date.
L230222 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Take it yourself. Take a date.
L230221 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.
L230220 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
L230219 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Opening night?
L230218 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
L230217 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
L229991 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ This person and I are a thing of the total past. I promise you.
L229990 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
L229989 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
L229988 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
L229986 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend.
L229985 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ She is kicking you out.
L229984 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
L229983 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
L229982 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
L229981 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
L229980 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I just had breakfast with her. She didn't say a word about this.
L229979 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
L229978 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
L229968 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
L229967 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
L229966 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
L229965 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Is it?
L229964 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ That's completely crazy.
L229963 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
L229962 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Why do you need a radio?
L229961 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
L229960 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this?
L229959 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
L229958 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Do you want to get some coffee?
L229957 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ I go to college. I thought you knew.
L229956 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
L230596 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense.
L230595 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ See, Daddy.
L230592 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.
L230591 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ What else?
L230590 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
L230589 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ See, Daddy.
L230588 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ It's your best play, Nicky.
L230587 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
L230559 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Yes.
L230558 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ Am I really so deeply repugnant?
L230549 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name?
L230548 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
L230547 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
L230546 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ What's sexy?
L230545 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
L230544 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ Mystery. Deception.
L230543 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ What do we want?
L230542 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
L230541 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.
L230540 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ This building is not secure.
L230539 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Yes.
L230538 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ If you're wondering about the firearm.
L230535 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ A flat-out hit.
L230534 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ What else?
L230533 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Packs an emotional wallop.
L230532 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ What else?
L230531 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Brilliantly moving.
L230530 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ First you tell me.
L230529 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ You have to tell me what you thought of the play.
L230528 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ Names are incredibly intimate. We barely know each other. Trust me on this.
L230527 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ I'm willing to tell you my name.
L230526 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ It's only our first date.
L230525 +++$+++ u5451 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Why won't you tell me your name?
L230422 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I feel great. I feel impeccably alive. I'm elated. Eat something. Please. I love you.
L230421 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ I'm glad we're having this talk.
L230420 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
L230419 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
L230418 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
L230417 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ It violates so many trusts.
L230416 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I am really, deeply sorry.
L230415 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ She's my gynecologist.
L230414 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
L230413 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
L230412 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Alma Wetzel.
L230411 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ Joanne Bourne.
L230410 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
L230409 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
L230408 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ There may be things you'd rather not know about.
L230407 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ Be open with me. I'd like that.
L230406 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
L230405 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ That's very lovely actually.
L230404 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
L230403 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ I'd forgotten that.
L230402 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
L230401 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
L230400 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ And you've been extremely patient.
L230399 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ That's always been my problem.
L230398 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
L230397 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ Who the hell cares?
L230396 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Opening night, Lillian.
L230392 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Bring me the bay scallops with mercury poisoning.
L230391 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
L230390 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'll have whatever she's having.
L230389 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ He has his own submarine. I'll be getting everything that matters. I'll get New York and I'll get Connecticut.
L230388 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ How prominent?
L230387 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
L230386 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ All right. What's been going on?
L230385 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
L230384 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
L230383 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
L230382 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Two-all after six.
L230381 +++$+++ u5452 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ Your father said you might be here.
