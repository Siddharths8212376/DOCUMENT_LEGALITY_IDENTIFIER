L637933 +++$+++ u8743 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Yes.
L637932 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Whatever the `truth' is, let's hear that.  You were her doctor.
L637931 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Don't equivocate.  Be positive. Just tell the truth.
L637930 +++$+++ u8743 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ No, actually, she was referred to me.  She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
L638377 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
L638376 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Objection!
L638184 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Your Honor...!  Your Honor...
L638183 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
L638182 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
L638181 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...to get her heartbeat back...?
L638180 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Objection, we've...
L637795 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Frank Galvin.  We've met before.
L637794 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Ed Concannon.
L638125 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Objection.
L638124 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I did.
L638121 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Do you, indeed.  I'll bet you do. Fine.  Fine.  We'll save the court the time.  We will admit the Doctor as an `expert witness,' fine.
L638120 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
L638119 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
L638118 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I'm on the staff of...
L638117 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
L638116 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I am seventy-four years old.
L638115 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ How old are you?
L638114 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ `Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes.
L638113 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ ...of Anesthesiology?
L638112 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ Meth...Methodology and Technique...
L638111 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ What book is that?
L638110 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ Through, through his book.
L638109 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ How is that?
L638108 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I know of him.
L638107 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
L638106 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I'm just an M.D.
L638105 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Orthopedics?
L638104 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ No.
L638103 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Neurology?
L638102 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ No.
L638101 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ ...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?
L638100 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...
L638099 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
L638098 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ Just as you are, Sir...
L638097 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
L638096 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
L638095 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.  Is that correct?
L638404 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I'm going to uphold that.
L638403 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
L638402 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
L638401 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ ...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
L638400 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
L638395 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ You may step down.
L638394 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ No further questions.
L638388 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I'll rule on that presently.   Proceed.
L638387 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Objection!  This is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
L638329 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
L638328 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Nothing further, your Honor.
L638327 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Mr. Concannon...?
L637805 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price.  They wanted this cleared up in court.  They want their vindication.  I agree with them.  But for today the offer stands.  Before we begin the publicity of a trial.  For today only.    When I  walk out that door the offer is withdrawn.  As long as you understand that.  It's got to be that way.
L637804 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Huh!
L637803 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
L638393 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse...
L638392 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ And why, please tell us, would you think that?
L638391 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I thought I would need it.
L638390 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ ...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears?  This is a...why?  Why would you do that?
L638386 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Because I kept a copy.  I have it right here.
L638385 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
L638384 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
L638383 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You've just said you signed it.
L638382 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ That's not my handwriting.
L638381 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
L638380 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I do.  Yes.
L638379 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ `They lied.'  Indeed!  When did they lie?  And do you know what a lie is?
L638378 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ They lied.
L638375 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You know these doctors could have settled out of court.  They wanted a trial.  They wanted to clear their names.
L638374 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I...
L638373 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
L638372 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I...yes.
L638371 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?
L638370 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I . . ..
L638369 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
L638368 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Yes.
L638367 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ ...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
L638366 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Yes.
L638365 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Just now...
L638364 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Yes.
L638363 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?
L638362 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ No.
L638361 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You would not...?
L638360 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I wouldn't do it.
L638359 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.
L638358 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ It's a crime.
L638357 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
L637854 +++$+++ u8741 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
L637853 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
L637852 +++$+++ u8741 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ You guys, you guys, you're all the same.  The Doctors at the hospital, you...it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's `We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...'  And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
L637851 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm going to win this case...Mist...Mr. Doneghy...I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
L637850 +++$+++ u8741 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
L637849 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
L637848 +++$+++ u8741 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ You ruined my life, Mister...Me and my wife...and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl.  We been going four years.    Four years...my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
L637847 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ It's all right, Mickey.
L637846 +++$+++ u8741 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did?  Do you know what you did?
L637845 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Hold on a second.
L637844 +++$+++ u8741 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?
L637596 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ It's completely done on a contingency basis.  That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third ...that is, of course, the usual arrangement ...
L637595 +++$+++ u8741 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ What is this going to cost?
L637592 +++$+++ u8741 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ We just ...
L637591 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I completely understand ...
L637590 +++$+++ u8741 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ ... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
L637589 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I doubt we'll have to go to trial ...
L637588 +++$+++ u8741 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ ...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
L637585 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here.
L637584 +++$+++ u8741 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ ... that's all right.
L637583 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Please sit down.  I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here.  I've got a case coming in two days in the  Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
L638038 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ It's a common medical term.
L638037 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ 'Code Blue'...
L638036 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?
L638035 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
L638034 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ She getting good care over there?
L638033 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ ...I made a detailed physical examination of the patient, Sir, yesterday evening, I...
L638032 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
L638031 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I am on the staff of...
L638030 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
L638029 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I am seventy-four years old.
L638028 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Is that what a good doctor would do?  How old are you, please?
L638027 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ ...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
L638026 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
L638025 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...
L638024 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Why is that?
L638023 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
L638143 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I...um...
L638142 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ The Doctors were not negligent.
L638141 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
L638140 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
L638139 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'
L638134 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ Well...
L638133 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
L638197 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ No.  No.  Thank you. You go home.
L638196 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ You sure you don't want me to stay on.
L638195 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Yes...I...yes.
L638194 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ You know...sometimes people can surprise you.  Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
L638193 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ No.  No thank you, Doctor.  You go home.
L638192 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
L638191 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ No, you did fine.
L638190 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I didn't do too well for you.
L638132 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
L638131 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
L638130 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
L638129 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Dr. Thompson.  From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.  In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
L637985 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ There's nothing they can do to me.
L637984 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
L637983 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ ...What difference would...
L637982 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
L637981 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ ...I made a reservation at...
L637980 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
L637979 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
L637978 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
L637977 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ That's what I'd planned to...
L637976 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
L637974 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ It was good of you to meet...
L637973 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Dr. Thompson...?
L638326 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Thank you.
L638325 +++$+++ u8743 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case.
