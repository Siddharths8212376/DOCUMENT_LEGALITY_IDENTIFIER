L337457 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Sure.  Too much birthday cake, right?
L337456 +++$+++ u6217 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Can I be excused?  I'm not hungry.
L337455 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Yeah?
L337454 +++$+++ u6217 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Mom, I mean dad?
L337453 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Well, I see the Yankees finally won a game.
L337452 +++$+++ u6217 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Sorry.
L337451 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
L337450 +++$+++ u6217 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Okay...Same as usual...
L337442 +++$+++ u6217 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Goodbye.
L337441 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--
L337440 +++$+++ u6217 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ You're late.
L337403 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You got a letter from mom.
L337402 +++$+++ u6217 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Uh, huh...
L337381 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'll call Thelma and remind her, okay?  Don't worry.
L337380 +++$+++ u6217 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ What if she forgets?
L337379 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
L337378 +++$+++ u6217 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Will she pick me up after school?
L337377 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
L337376 +++$+++ u6217 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ When is mommy coming back?
L337371 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Right.  One O.J. coming up.
L337370 +++$+++ u6217 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ What about my orange juice?
L337368 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That's right.  You're absolutely right...It's been a long time since I made French toast.
L337367 +++$+++ u6217 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ You forgot the milk.
L337364 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Sure.  Didn't I ever tell you French toast was my specialty? I'll bet I never told you that. Now then, the first thing we need is...  ... eggs!  Right?
L337363 +++$+++ u6217 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Wow!  French toast, really?
L337362 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'll tell you what, kiddo--why don't I fix us some French toast?
L337361 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Soon.  Very soon.
L337360 +++$+++ u6217 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ When is mommy coming back?
L337358 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Oh, Christ...Ah, yeah...you want to know why mom's not here, right?
L337357 +++$+++ u6217 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
L337356 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Huh?...Oh God...What time is it?
L338061 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ Then I have concluded my questions.
L338060 +++$+++ u6221 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
L338059 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ Does the witness deny the injury took place?
L338058 +++$+++ u6221 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
L338057 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ I do not, your honor, however--
L338056 +++$+++ u6221 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I see.  Well, you'll have to do better than that.  Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?
L338055 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ Yes, your honor.
L338054 +++$+++ u6221 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?
L338042 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ Mr. Kramer, isn't it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago?
L338041 +++$+++ u6221 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Sustained.
L337981 +++$+++ u6221 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Overruled.
L337980 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ Objection!
L337967 +++$+++ u6221 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Sustained.
L337966 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ Objection!  I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.
L337956 +++$+++ u6221 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Overruled.  The witness will answer, please.
L337955 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ Objection!
L337929 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ Mrs. Kramer, can you tell the court why you are asking for custody?
L337928 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
L337927 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York?
L337926 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ Your honor, I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla, California.
L337925 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Yes...Look, during the last five years we were married, I had...I was getting more and more...unhappy, more and more frustrated.  I needed to talk to somebody.  I needed to find out if it was me, if I was going crazy or what.  But every time I turned to Ted--my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it.  He became very...I don't know, very threatened.  I mean, when- ever I would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack.  Anyway, we became more and more separate ...more and more isolated from one another.  Finally, I had no other choice, I had to leave. And because of my ex-husband's attitude--his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, I had come to have almost no self- esteem...  At the time I left, I sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me--that my son would be better off without me.  It was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to realize I wasn't a terrible person.  And that just because I needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother.
L337924 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ And yet you chose to leave him?
L337923 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Yes.  Very much.
L337922 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?
L337921 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year.
L337920 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ And what is your present salary?
L337919 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
L337918 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
L337917 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
L337916 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ Did you wish to?
L337915 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ No, I did not.
L337914 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?
L337913 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
L337912 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ And would you describe those years as happy?
L337911 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Six years.
L337910 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married?
L338053 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ While the child was in the care of the witness, he cut his face badly and is now scarred.
L338052 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ Objection!  Your honor, counsel is raising a question that is not germane to these proceedings.
L338048 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ Your honor, I'm only examining the man's employment record.  He pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job.
L338047 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ Objection, your honor!  Counsel is harassing the witness.
L338040 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ Objection!
L338039 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ So do I.
L338034 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ No questions.
L338033 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ No further questions.  Thank you Mrs. Phillips.
L338031 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr. Kramer's care of his child?
L338030 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ Objection, your honor.  The answer is, to be generous, very vague.
L337987 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ Your honor, I'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at?  Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life?
L337986 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ Objection!
L337969 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ Objection!
L337968 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?
L337960 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ Your honor, I would request a direct answer to a direct question.  Does she have a lover?
L337959 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ Objection!
L337948 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs. Kramer?
L337947 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ Objection.
L338004 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ Thank you.  I have no further questions.
L338003 +++$+++ u6222 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ O'CONNOR +++$+++ Ted was a good worker.  But, ah... ... after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own, things started to change. Look, I know he had problems, I understand that.  I've got problems, everybody's got problems.  But I've got a shop to run, I can't let that kind of thing get in the way...  I guess I felt that Ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office.
L338002 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ And yet you fired him.
L338001 +++$+++ u6222 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ O'CONNOR +++$+++ It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
L338000 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ And how did you find his work?
L337999 +++$+++ u6222 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ O'CONNOR +++$+++ Yes...
L337998 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ And did you have a close personal relationship?
L337997 +++$+++ u6222 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ O'CONNOR +++$+++ Eight, almost nine years.
L337996 +++$+++ u6218 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ GRESSEN +++$+++ Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?
L337792 +++$+++ u6219 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ INTERVIEWER +++$+++ My, we are a hot shot aren't we?
L337791 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Either you call and set up the appointment, or I'll call.  And if I call, you lose the commission.
L337790 +++$+++ u6219 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ INTERVIEWER +++$+++ Mis-ter Kramer, it's...  ...almost four now.  It's the Friday before Christmas.  Nobody is going to want to--
L337789 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson.  Set up an appointment at four.
L337788 +++$+++ u6219 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ INTERVIEWER +++$+++ There might be something at J. Walter Thompson.  But...  ...I don't think they're really serious.  The position's been open for two months and...  They may just be on a fishing expedition.  I'm sure you'll be much happier if you wait until after the first--
L337770 +++$+++ u6219 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ INTERVIEWER +++$+++ I understand and I'm absolutely sure something wonderful will turn up....  ...after the first of the year.
L337769 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
L337768 +++$+++ u6219 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ INTERVIEWER +++$+++ Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.
L337767 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand.
L337766 +++$+++ u6219 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ INTERVIEWER +++$+++ Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm...  Well, this looks very good.. Of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job.
L337992 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Yes.
L337991 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ Were you?
L337985 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer. You have just rewritten matrimonial law.  You were both divorced, Mrs. Kramer.
L337984 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ I consider it less my failure than his.
L337983 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ Oh?  What do you call it then --a success?  The marriage ended in divorce.
L337982 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ I was not a failure.
L337979 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ So, you were a failure at the longest, most important relationship in your life.
L337978 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
L337977 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ How long was that?
L337976 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Yes.
L337975 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
L337974 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ I suppose...
L337973 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ Whom you've seen twice in a year? Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't he the longest personal relationship in your life?
L337965 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ Then, we don't really know, do we, when you say "permanently" if you're planning to remain in New York, or even to keep the child for that matter, since you've never really done anything in your life that was continuing, stable, that could be regarded as permanent.
L337964 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ I...I don't know...
L337963 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ Is that...permanent?
L337958 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ Do you have a lover now?
L337957 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Somewhere in between.
L337954 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ More than three, less than thirty- three--permanently?
L337953 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ I don't recall.
L337952 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
L337951 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ I don't recall.
L337946 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ Well, I can certainly understand why you left him.
L337945 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ No.
L337944 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ Did he ever fail to provide for you?
L337943 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ No.
L337942 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ Was he unfaithful?
L337941 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ No.
L337940 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ A heavy drinker?
L337939 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ No.
L337938 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?
L337937 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ No.
L337936 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
L337935 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ No.
L337934 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.
L337933 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Yes.
L337932 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct?
L338143 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Beautiful.
L338142 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now.  How do I look?
L338141 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
L338140 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Only can I still see him?
L338139 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Oh, God...Oh, my God...
L338138 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
L338137 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What?
L338136 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ After I left...when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me.  Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him...And I did ...And I won.  Only...it was just another "should."  ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy.  I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you...
L338135 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Please...Please don't stop me. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do..
L338134 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Joanna, what the hell is--
L338133 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Ted, when we got married it was because I was twenty-seven years old and I thought I should get married and...when I had Billy it was because I thought I should have a baby...and I guess all I did was mess up my life and your life and--
L338131 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Ted, do you love him?
L338130 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
L338129 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Ted, do you love him?
L338128 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Okay, I'm here.  Now why did you--
L338066 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'm not interested, Joanna. Goodbye.
L338065 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Please, Ted.  I never would have brought it up if I thought--
L338064 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Yeah, well he did, didn't he.
L338063 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ I'm sorry...I just mentioned it in passing.  I never thought he'd use it.
L337743 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Joanna, go fuck yourself!
L337742 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
L337741 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Joanna, go be a mother.  Get married, have kids.  Don't get married, have kids.  Do whatever you want.  I don't give a damn. Just leave me out of it--and leave my baby out of it.
L337737 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Such as?
L337736 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
L337735 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Joanna, I don't give a--
L337734 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Ted, listen to me...You and I, we had a really crappy marriage--  Look, don't get so defensive, okay?  It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up--
L337733 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
L337732 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
L337731 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You want what?!
L337730 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.
L337729 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You've been living here, in the city?
L337728 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
L337727 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ He is...  You sat in that coffee shop across from school--
L337726 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ He looks like a terrific kid.
L337725 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ A few times.  Sometimes I sit in that coffee shop across the street and watch when you take him to school.
L337724 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You have?
L337723 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ I've seen him.
L337721 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ You can't tell it from a distance, Ted.
L337720 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I can't help but feel somehow... it's my fault.  I keep thinking I could've done something-- stopped it...
L337718 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Yes...How's Billy?
L337717 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Look at us, Joanna.  Just like any old married couple having dinner.  Who would believe it.
L337716 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Fine.
L337715 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ How's the new job?
L337712 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ So do you.
L337711 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Hello, Ted.  You look well.
L337318 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ I don't know...

L337316 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ NO!...Please...Please don't make me stay...I swear...If you do, sooner or later...maybe tomorrow, maybe next week...maybe a year from now...  I'll go right out the window.
L337315 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.
L337314 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.
L337313 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that.  You're a terrific mother--
L337312 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
L337311 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What?
L337310 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ I'm not taking him with me.

L337308 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ No you didn't.  You didn't even ask about Billy.
L337307 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
L337306 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ You just don't get it, do you?  I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
