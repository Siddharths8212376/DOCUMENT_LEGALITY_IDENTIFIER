L603802 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I don't understand.
L603801 +++$+++ u3240 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ THIN MAN +++$+++ And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
L603800 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Sir...?
L603799 +++$+++ u3240 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ THIN MAN +++$+++ I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
L603798 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Thank you...
L603797 +++$+++ u3240 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ THIN MAN +++$+++ Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.
L604379 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
L604378 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ It was different then.
L604138 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
L604137 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Mara -- what -- ?!
L604134 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ No!
L604133 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Mara...?
L604132 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Kalen...
L604131 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Please, I beg you.  Take him away from here --
L604130 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Mara --
L604129 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Alexander, take my son away.  Take him back to your time.  Will you do that?
L604128 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I could...
L604127 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Go back to your own time?
L604126 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Yes... I suppose so.
L604125 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ So you can use it now?
L604124 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
L604123 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ It's undamaged?
L604122 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Good -- it looks fine.  We had quite a ride together...
L604119 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end.
L604118 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives.  Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much.  I thank you for that.
L604117 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ If you only knew...
L604116 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Is it?
L604115 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
L604114 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Someone you loved very much.
L604113 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Yes.
L604112 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ You lost someone.
L604111 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ This is where my journey started... right here.
L604109 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Over there was Fifth Avenue -- and the Plaza Hotel was there... this is... the carriage path.  We're on the carriage path.
L604108 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ You know this?
L604107 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Those rocks, over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park.
L604106 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Orion's belt...
L604105 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Alexander...?
L604104 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Looking back... I suppose it was. I didn't quite realize it at the time but...
L604103 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
L604102 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
L604101 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ It must have been safe.
L604100 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
L604099 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Did you have fires at night?
L604098 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.
L604097 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Learning was important?
L604096 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
L604095 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ You liked it there.
L604094 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ ... It was a great city.  The greatest city in the world.
L604092 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ I try to imagine how they'll look when they're done.  I try to imagine how we'll fit in with them... our place in the world.
L604091 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ How do you decide?
L604090 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
L604089 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ What are you?
L604088 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
L604087 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Or mud carriers.
L604086 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
L604085 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
L604084 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
L604083 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
L604082 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ I don't understand.
L604081 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ What's it all for?
L604080 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
L604079 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ What you need is an engineer.  If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily.
L604078 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Want to be a high climber now, do you?
L604077 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I can see Kalen's point.
L604076 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ The mud carriers.
L604075 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Yes.
L604074 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ And this is your "work"?
L604073 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Thank you.
L604072 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ This is magnificent...
L604070 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ We share everything.
L604069 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ You share dreams?  That's incredible.
L604068 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Every night.
L604067 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ All of you?
L604066 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ We all have that dream.
L604065 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Yes!
L604064 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ And you saw a shape ahead of you...
L604063 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Yes.
L604062 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Then you came to a desert and mountains...
L604061 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Mara, I had a strange dream last night.  I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
L604052 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Good night.
L604051 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Good night, then.
L604050 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights.  I never really noticed them much...
L604049 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Don't then have stars where you come from?
L604048 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ You can see so many here.
L604047 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ You seem fascinated by the stars.
L604046 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Thank you...
L604045 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
L604044 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I will...
L604043 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ I'm going to sit with Kalen.  Keep the fire burning if you can.
L604042 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Just a dream.  You should sleep too.  You're still not well.
L604041 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Is he all right?
L604033 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ For a time it was astounding.  I saw the years spinning by, I was in the years spinning by.  We made such advances.  I don't understand half of them.  There was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky... We must have been incredible thinkers and artists --
L604032 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
L604031 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
L604030 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?
L604029 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Why would you do that?
L604028 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Why not?
L604027 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Why?
L604026 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ More than 800,000 years.
L604025 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ How long ago?
L604024 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
L604023 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ That machine --
L604022 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
L604021 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Oh, that explains everything.
L604019 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Then you can speak slowly.
L604018 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
L604017 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you.  And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
L604016 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ What makes you say that?
L604015 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ You're not from beyond the valley.
L604014 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
L604013 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ He's gone to a better place.
L604012 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Your husband is dead?
L604011 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Kalen will tire you out if you let him.  He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
L604007 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Mm.
L604006 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ His curiosity is amazing.
L604001 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
L604000 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Is there a lot of illness?
L603982 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Thank you.
L603981 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Yes.
L603961 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really.  It's rather hard to explain.
L603960 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ How long did you travel?
L603946 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Yes...
L603945 +++$+++ u3235 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ You're up!  You must be feeling better --
L603831 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ That'll be all.
L603830 +++$+++ u3237 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MRS. WATCHIT +++$+++ May I get you some --
L603829 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
L603827 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Tell him to go away --
L603826 +++$+++ u3237 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MRS. WATCHIT +++$+++ Yes, sir, he --
L603825 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Here?
L603824 +++$+++ u3237 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MRS. WATCHIT +++$+++ Sir, Mr. Philby is here.
L603743 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
L603742 +++$+++ u3237 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MRS. WATCHIT +++$+++ Oh, I'm already swooning.
L603741 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
L603740 +++$+++ u3237 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MRS. WATCHIT +++$+++ Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
L603724 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ What's the matter with -- ?  -- What would I do without you, Mrs. Watchit?
L603723 +++$+++ u3237 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MRS. WATCHIT +++$+++ I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
L603722 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Don't torture me -- do you have it?
L603719 +++$+++ u3237 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MRS. WATCHIT +++$+++ Hello, Mr. Philby.
L603718 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Do you have it?!
L603717 +++$+++ u3237 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MRS. WATCHIT +++$+++ Oh huzzah, the master's home.
L603696 +++$+++ u3231 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ DEAN FULTON +++$+++ Very good.  Now if you will excuse us for a moment.
L603695 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L603692 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Because it's a new way of seeing the world!  Of seeing our place in it!
L603691 +++$+++ u3231 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ DEAN FULTON +++$+++ Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
L603690 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ My equations are not parlor-tricks!
L603689 +++$+++ u3231 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ DEAN FULTON +++$+++ The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
L603688 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
L603686 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Sir --
L603685 +++$+++ u3231 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ DEAN FULTON +++$+++ Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
L603684 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ No, sir --
L603683 +++$+++ u3231 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ DEAN FULTON +++$+++ No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
L603682 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ And roosters.
L603679 +++$+++ u3231 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ DEAN FULTON +++$+++ Do they?
L603678 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Sir, that curriculum is forty years out of date.  The students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired, not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times.  They want to explore.
L603677 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
L603676 +++$+++ u3231 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ DEAN FULTON +++$+++ Might I ask why?
L603675 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
L603674 +++$+++ u3231 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ DEAN FULTON +++$+++ But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
L603673 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Imagine that.
L603672 +++$+++ u3231 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ DEAN FULTON +++$+++ Well, just as I thought.  Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!
L603671 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Exactly correct, sir.
L603670 +++$+++ u3231 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ DEAN FULTON +++$+++ As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
L603669 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I see.
L603668 +++$+++ u3231 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ DEAN FULTON +++$+++ Dr. Philby, Dr. Hartdegen.  I received the most extraordinary letter last week.  From a parent. We are always pleased to receive letters from parents.  They are our employers, after all.  This gentleman's son is in your class, Dr. Hartdegen.
L604158 +++$+++ u3234 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ KORUS +++$+++ We can't change the day and the night, Alexander.  This is the world.
L604157 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ You won't even try?
L604156 +++$+++ u3234 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ KORUS +++$+++ We are what we are.
L604155 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Then it's time to change that --
L604154 +++$+++ u3234 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ KORUS +++$+++ This is out life, Alexander.  It's a hard life but it is how we have always lived.
L604151 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ My God!  How can you just do nothing!?  They're your friends, your family.  You all knew Mara. You ate with her and worked with her... Your work in the valley, what is that for if not to --
L604150 +++$+++ u3234 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ KORUS +++$+++ We choose to believe it.
L604149 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ You know that's not true.
L604148 +++$+++ u3234 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ KORUS +++$+++ They've gone to a better place.
L604147 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ What do you mean?!
L604146 +++$+++ u3234 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ KORUS +++$+++ Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
L604145 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ We have to go after them, find where -- !
L604144 +++$+++ u3234 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ KORUS +++$+++ We don't know.
L604143 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Where do they take them?!
L604056 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I suppose so.
L604055 +++$+++ u3234 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ KORUS +++$+++ Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?
L603980 +++$+++ u3234 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ KORUS +++$+++ Of course.  You're just tired. Mara, will you look after Alexander tonight?
L603979 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
L603978 +++$+++ u3234 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ KORUS +++$+++ My father has gone to a better place.
L603977 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?

L603975 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Yes.  I hope you won't take this the wrong way but is there someone older I could talk to?  An elder or patriarch of some kind?
