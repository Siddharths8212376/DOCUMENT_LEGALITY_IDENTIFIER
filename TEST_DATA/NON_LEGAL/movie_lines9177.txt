L327807 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
L327806 +++$+++ u1586 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SUSIE +++$+++ The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.
L327805 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Dammit, it doesn't add up!  Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return.  Only intelligence people can come and go like that.
L327804 +++$+++ u1586 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SUSIE +++$+++ None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
L327803 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
L327802 +++$+++ u1586 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SUSIE +++$+++ Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.
L327801 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ But who meets him when he gets off the boat in New York in June '62?
L327800 +++$+++ u1586 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SUSIE +++$+++ The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
L327799 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
L327798 +++$+++ u1586 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SUSIE +++$+++ None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
L327797 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Don't get sidetracked!  How does he get back to the States?  That's the point.  Does he have any problems?
L327791 +++$+++ u1586 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SUSIE +++$+++ But he never writes, speaks, or does any propaganda for the Russians.  He meets Marina, whose uncle is a colonel in Soviet intelligence, at a trade union dance; she thinks he's Russian the way he speaks, six weeks later they marry, have a daughter.
L327790 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
L327789 +++$+++ u1586 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SUSIE +++$+++ Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
L327782 +++$+++ u1586 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SUSIE +++$+++ Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.
L327781 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?
L328072 +++$+++ u1585 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ Now just a minute, sir!  You're way out of line!
L328071 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
L328070 +++$+++ u1585 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
L328069 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
L328068 +++$+++ u1585 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you?
L328067 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Mr. Shaw, have you ever been a contract agent with the Central Intelligence Agency?
L328066 +++$+++ u1585 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
L328065 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ ...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
L328064 +++$+++ u1585 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ Nonsense.  What next?
L328063 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
L328062 +++$+++ u1585 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
L328061 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy, that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfer of funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities.  It says that this company was expelled from Italy for those activities.
L328060 +++$+++ u1585 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ Of course not!  Such a pity, that assassination.  In fact, I admired President Kennedy.  A man with true panache, and a wife with impeccable taste.
L328059 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Please answer the question.
L328058 +++$+++ u1585 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.
L328057 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?
L328056 +++$+++ u1585 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
L328055 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
L328048 +++$+++ u1585 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
L328047 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
L328046 +++$+++ u1585 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
L328045 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
L328044 +++$+++ u1585 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.
L328043 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Let me show you his picture. 
L328040 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ ...and that the four of you partied early into the morning hours...
L328039 +++$+++ u1585 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
L328038 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ David Ferrie.
L328037 +++$+++ u1585 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ Who?
L328036 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ ...in the course of that night, Mr. O'Keefe said a man named David Ferrie stopped by the house... along with another young man...
L328035 +++$+++ u1585 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
L328034 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
L328033 +++$+++ u1585 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ It adds a taste of elegance for which I must confess a weakness for now and then.  I call him Smedley.  His real name is Frankie Jenkins - but I could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering "Frankie!" .. Where is this leading to, Mr. Garrison?
L328032 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
L328031 +++$+++ u1585 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
L328030 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.  He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?
L328028 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you at the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on Dauphine Street.  Do you recall that?
L328027 +++$+++ u1585 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
L328026 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ A Willie O'Keefe?
L328025 +++$+++ u1585 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ No.
L328024 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ A Perry Russo?
L328023 +++$+++ u1585 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ No.  Never heard of him.
L328022 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
L328021 +++$+++ u1585 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ I wouldn't imagine where.
L328020 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
L328019 +++$+++ u1585 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ I'm not sure I understand.
L328346 +++$+++ u1578 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MERCER +++$+++ I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is just not doing their job.
L328345 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
L328344 +++$+++ u1578 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MERCER +++$+++ This says "Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck."  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all...
L328343 +++$+++ u1578 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MERCER +++$+++ That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements...
L328342 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
L328341 +++$+++ u1578 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MERCER +++$+++ That's right.  When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.  I said to my family, "that was the man I saw in the truck."
L328340 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You mean you identified him on Saturday, the day before Ruby shot Oswald?
L328332 +++$+++ u1578 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MERCER +++$+++ Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day.
L328331 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...
L328598 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
L328597 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
L328596 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Huh?
L328595 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ They killed him, honey.
L328591 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ I don't think so, Jim...
L328590 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
L328589 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ And if you're wrong?
L328546 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
L328545 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey."  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
L328544 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government.  I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!
L328543 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.
L328542 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm tired.  I've had enough!  They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking.  You're ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid "trial"! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?
L328541 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?
L328540 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
L328539 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
L328538 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
L328537 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
L328536 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
L328535 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
L328534 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
L328533 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.
L328532 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.
L328531 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Get a hold of yourself.
L328530 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
L328529 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
L328528 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
L328527 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
L328526 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Your daughter's life was just threatened!
L328525 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
L328524 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ A man just called.  He asked her everything!
L328523 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What?
L328522 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest?
L328131 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
L328130 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
L328127 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Don't be.  Nothing to be scared about, honey, I been through four years of war - this is nothing.
L328126 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
L328125 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Did they live?
L328087 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ It's going to get worse, honey.
L328086 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
L328085 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
L328084 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
L328083 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I don't know what to say except I'm sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on my mind.
L328082 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.
L328081 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
L328080 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ My sympathies.
L328079 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Tough day.
L328078 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Hi.
L328016 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Look, I'll rush and be there by two, I promise.  Go ahead without me.
L328015 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
L328014 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.
L328013 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
L328012 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?
L328011 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
L328010 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
L328007 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You know I don't like these tribal rituals, Freckle Face.  I'm interviewing Clay Shaw this morning.
L328006 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Jim, come on, honey, get down on your hands and knees and hunt for Jasper's Easter egg.
L328004 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A quiet little chat between gentlemen.
L328003 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Do you have any evidence against him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter.  He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.
L327674 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Goddammit!  I been sleeping for three years!
L327673 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Honey, go back to sleep, please!
L327672 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
L327671 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
L327670 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.
L327669 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop readin' them.
L327668 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
L327667 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
L327666 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
L327665 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Honey, you all right? 
L327647 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh, she did, huh?  When I come up I'll show you how Saturday night got invented.
L327646 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday night date you are.  Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.
L327639 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed.  Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy.
L327638 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.
L327630 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Come on now, we'll talk about it at the table, dinner's getting cold.  What are you doing in here?
L327629 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
L327628 +++$+++ u1572 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.
L327953 +++$+++ u1582 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ O'KEEFE +++$+++ You wanna know why?  'Cause that mother fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why!  Nixon was gonna be one of the great Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country.  Got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause Kennedy promised 'em too damned much. Revolution comin'.  Fascism's coming back.  I tell ya this - the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  I jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know shit anyway.  People should know why that sumbitch was killed.  'Cause he was a Communist.  Put me on the stand, go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn story, I'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change.
L327952 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
L327951 +++$+++ u1582 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ O'KEEFE +++$+++ Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...
L327950 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.
L327949 +++$+++ u1582 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ O'KEEFE +++$+++ Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you can tell'em all I told you so.
L327948 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal?  Under the supervision of a doctor?
L327913 +++$+++ u1582 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ O'KEEFE +++$+++ I remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg.  He limped. Don't get me wrong, he's not one of those, you know, limp wrists.  He's a butch John.  You'd meet him on the street, you'd never snap.  You could go fishing with him, play poker with him, you'd never snap in a million years.  So one night we were over at Ferrie's place.  Having a party. Sometime in the late summer of '63.
L327912 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Anything else unusual about him you'd be able to describe in a court of law, Willie?
L327909 +++$+++ u1582 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ O'KEEFE +++$+++ Well... yeah.
L327908 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ For sexual purposes?
L327905 +++$+++ u1582 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ O'KEEFE +++$+++ Call me Willie.  I ain't got nuthin' but time, Mr. Garrison.  Minutes, hours, days, years of'em.  Time just stands still here like a snake sunnin' itself in the road...
L327904 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.
L328497 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ You sure got it.  You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake!
L328496 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.
L328495 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
L328494 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
L328493 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Boss, then I'm afraid I can't continue working with Bill.
L328492 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
L328491 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ I just plain don't trust him anymore.
L328486 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ We need him back.
L328485 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Chief, I've had my doubts about Bill for a long time.  He's fighting everything.
L328431 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ You never got anyone killed, boss. Their actions killed them years before.  If we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong.
L328430 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Maybe we should just call it a day, Lou.  Go home.  While we're still a little behind.  We got two people killed, maybe more we never thought about.
L328429 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ They're gonna love you, chief.
L328428 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy fired them both.  Cabell was his deputy for nine years.  Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop.  Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou.
L328427 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Allen Dulles?
L328426 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
L328425 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ The Warren Commission call him?
L328424 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.
L328423 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Who?
L328422 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?
L328421 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ No.
L328420 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You know who the mayor was?
L328419 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.
L328418 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Who do you think changed the parade route?
L328415 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ One shooter.  One spotter on a radio. Maybe three teams.  I'd say these were professional riflemen, chief, serious people.  Hunters...  patient. It takes skill to kill with a rifle, that's why there's been no execution of an executive with one in 200 years... "3-2-1...  green!"  Or else "Abort!  Abort!"
L328414 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ How many men?
L328413 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.
L328410 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?
L328409 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
L328408 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get our hands on it.
L328407 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public.
L328406 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
L328405 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
L328404 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Between six and seven seconds.
L328403 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Time?
L328252 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
L328251 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
L328231 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ I'm onto Ferrie's Cuban paymaster, Eladio del Valle, in Miami.  I gotta get him in, boss.  I need more men - I can't even pull the teams to watch Ferrie... This is our case!
L328230 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
L328229 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.
L328090 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ And it ain't pretty  ..."the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966.
L328089 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Goddamn Sam!
L327992 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I know you do, Lou.  I'm doing three more lectures this month.  You're all doing an incredible job, Sue, Al, Numa.  But this is one where if you don't nail the other guy, you're dead.  How did Jack Ruby dies so quick?  Of what?  Cancer, right?  A history of Nazi Germany, Lou.  They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's.  We learned a lot more than you think from the Nazis.  Read this. Our biological warfare lab is in Fort Detrick, Maryland.  Close to where the National Cancer Institute is located.  Think about it.  Think the unthinkable - question everything.
L327991 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Mobbed up all the way.  Tight with the Dallas cops.  I'm digging, chief. I just need 10 more men and some more dollars.
