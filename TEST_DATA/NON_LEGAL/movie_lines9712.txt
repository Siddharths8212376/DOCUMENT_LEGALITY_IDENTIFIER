L143818 +++$+++ u4624 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ SOCIETY RED +++$+++ You just said he could eat anything.
L143817 +++$+++ u4620 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ DRAGLINE +++$+++ Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
L143815 +++$+++ u4620 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ DRAGLINE +++$+++ He's the champeen hog-gut of this camp. Hell, I seen him eat ten choc'lat bars and seven cold drinks in fifteen minutes. He kin eat busted bottles and rusty nails, any damn thing. If you'd so kindly oblige as to let me cut off your yankee head, he'd even eat that.
L143814 +++$+++ u4624 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ SOCIETY RED +++$+++ Not a liar. You just have a common -- and likable -- tendency toward exaggeration.
L143485 +++$+++ u4620 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ DRAGLINE +++$+++ Maybe we oughta call you No-Ears. You don't listen much, do you, boy?

L144134 +++$+++ u4622 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ KOKO +++$+++ You ain't man enough to wear them!
L144133 +++$+++ u4624 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ SOCIETY RED +++$+++ No. No chains either.

L143587 +++$+++ u4624 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ SOCIETY RED +++$+++ You can't expect him to learn everything the first day. Hopefully it's taught him a very valuable lesson.
L143586 +++$+++ u4622 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ KOKO +++$+++ You can't switch 'round jobs, anyway. I figured he knew that.
L143516 +++$+++ u4622 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ KOKO +++$+++ Hell, no. I ain't goin' down in the ditch.
L143515 +++$+++ u4624 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ SOCIETY RED +++$+++ Koko, why don't you let one of these Newmeats take your broom for today?
L144516 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ A little homeopathic cure for the willies.
L144515 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ It's good medicine.
L144407 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Open space.  She hasn't been out of this apartment in three years.  I didn't used to think it was real...
L144406 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ Fear of what...
L144405 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.
L144404 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ What did I do?
L144403 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Now look what you did.
L144373 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Only kidding!
L144372 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ I hate this...
L144370 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ None of your fucking business.
L144369 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs?
L145061 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Hal has it.
L145060 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Where have you <u>been</u>?  What happened to your wallet?
L144897 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ But </u>alive</u>!
L144896 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You bastard!
L144894 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Stop acting like a silly little fag!
L144893 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ It's almost six.  And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.
L144892 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You've got a date right <u>here</u>, Andy. This has got to...
L144891 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Sorry, Luv.  I've got a date.
L144695 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I know.  Do come and meet your guest.
L144694 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You're fired.
L144586 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Look out for her.  She's tougher than you think.
L144585 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You go.  Poor thing, you ought to get out.
L144584 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ The moon is up, my night to howl. Will you be okay?
L144519 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Get out!  All of you!
L144518 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
L144517 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ None of you know anything about it. Now go.  And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.
L144471 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Then, why don't you just die.  I'm going.  They'll find your body years later, the old recluse lady, she ate cat food, ten years of the New York Times, unread, piled on top of the unread mail, the TV still on.  Make up your mind.  Live or die.  I'll get coffee.
L144470 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I can't, Andy.
L144469 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ About what?
L144468 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ When are you going to call them?
L144467 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ You <u>slut</u>!  No sexy young cop for you unless you shampoo your hair.
L144466 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me...
L144465 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ What?  What'd I do?
L144463 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you want him.  The cute brutal type with handcuffs.  Very sexy.
L144462 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I want to die.
L144461 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
L144460 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible.
L144368 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up.
L144367 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
L144366 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
L144365 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You parked right behind him.  The one I noticed earlier.  I didn't say anything, I thought he'd leave. Just take a look.
L144363 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Andy?
L144362 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Cellulite.  What do you say I blindfold you and take you to the gym.  Aerobics with housewives...
L144361 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Monsieur Andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure.  And guess what else?
L144360 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
L144359 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ When was the last time you washed your hair?
L144358 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Oh God.  I'm really crazy.
L144357 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Andy?  When a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'.  You look under the bad.  I'm three years old.  Call the prison.
L144356 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ He can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you.  Did you give him an approval?
L144355 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ He whispered, but it was <u>him</u>!  I know it was him!
L144354 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.
L144353 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."
L144352 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
L144351 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.
L144350 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Well!  Aren't we the daring one? What's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door?  The antenna is gone off her car again.  I had no music, all the way to the market.  Let me find a garage for it?
L144349 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I got it myself... I couldn't wait.
L144348 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Would you please get your hands off my face, Tallulah?  What happened to the newspaper?
L144347 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Where were you?  Don't tell me. It's just under seventy, right?  The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh...
L144572 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Gaahhd!  What a <u>cop</u>!  You busted me!  The new one, in the Marina.  She has a police radio scanner. It's always on.  She turns it off, and then she has to turn it on again.  She's obsessed.  She can't not listen to it, but she can't listen to it, so she makes me listen to it.
L144571 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Tell her about <u>what</u>?
L144570 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ She just got to sleep.  Do you have to tell her about it now?
L144411 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Hey, no.  Leave those here.  If you really want her help.  I mean if you really do, leave them.  Let her see them.  I'll see they're safe...
L144410 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Tell her we're sorry we bothered her.
L144409 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
L144408 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ We'll get the paramedics...
L144385 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ You talked to me.  Do you remember?
L144384 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Are you staying long?  Shall I shut the door?  Make your coffee?  Make the beds?
L144377 +++$+++ u4626 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
L144376 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
L144444 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Yes.  I believed him.
L144443 +++$+++ u4627 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ATTORNEY +++$+++ And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
L144442 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ When he was seventeen.
L144441 +++$+++ u4627 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ATTORNEY +++$+++ When was that?
L144440 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ He told me he had done two others just like it.
L144439 +++$+++ u4627 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ATTORNEY +++$+++ What first two murders.  We don't know about them here, do we?
L144438 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ The first two murders.
L144435 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ The same as the first time...
L144434 +++$+++ u4627 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ATTORNEY +++$+++ What pattern was that?
L144433 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ He took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong.  He was not acting on mad impulse.  He was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time.
L144432 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Because people who are suffering from aural hallucinations hear voices in both ears.  Daryll Lee told me that Joan of Arc always appeared beside him on his left side and spoke softly in his left ear.
L144431 +++$+++ u4627 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ATTORNEY +++$+++ You said, first, he was lying.  How do you know that, Doctor?
L144430 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I thought he was lying.
L144429 +++$+++ u4627 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ATTORNEY +++$+++ 'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
L144428 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ He was lying.
L144427 +++$+++ u4627 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ATTORNEY +++$+++ Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
L144426 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
L144425 +++$+++ u4627 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ ATTORNEY +++$+++ Without question?  He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria?  Couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test?  What curve are you marking on, Doctor?
L144424 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Yes.  Without question.
L144976 +++$+++ u4628 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ What day is this?  In jail you lose track.  This week.  Friday.
L144975 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ What Friday?
L144974 +++$+++ u4628 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
L144973 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ You already made the delivery?
L144972 +++$+++ u4628 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ Wait... wait... I already called him, I threw it away.
L144971 +++$+++ u4628 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ I don't have it...
L144970 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone number.
L144969 +++$+++ u4628 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ Tell me what you want me to say. Anything.
L144968 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Doesn't work that way.  You had your chance, now fuck yourself...
L144967 +++$+++ u4628 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ You get me out first.
L144966 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ You don't listen very good.  This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  Or I could see it gets forgotten.
L144965 +++$+++ u4628 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ I never carried a gun!
L144964 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
L144963 +++$+++ u4628 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ I never hurt nobody...
L144962 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
L144961 +++$+++ u4628 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ I was?  How you spell that?

L144821 +++$+++ u4628 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ She's supposed to have it.
L144820 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ We know...  Send the book to evidence...
L144819 +++$+++ u4628 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ The door was already open...
L144818 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
L144817 +++$+++ u4628 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it.  They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow.  It has all about how he tried to kill her.
L144816 +++$+++ u4628 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
L144815 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ Where is it?
L144814 +++$+++ u4628 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
L144813 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?

L144930 +++$+++ u4629 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ DARYLL +++$+++ That Klutz.  They send him back here, I'll kick his ass good.
L144929 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ In jail.
L144928 +++$+++ u4629 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ DARYLL +++$+++ Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
L144927 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
L144926 +++$+++ u4629 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ DARYLL +++$+++ Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too! That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you.
L144925 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
L144924 +++$+++ u4629 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ DARYLL +++$+++ You come and visit.
L144923 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
L144922 +++$+++ u4629 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ DARYLL +++$+++ Listen, you want my advice?  Steer clear.  He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk.  I'm offended.  Right away I smell <u>freak</u>.  Writin' about him and me and <u>you</u> bein' joined and he's gonna finish my <u>symphony</u>?  I didn't care for his drift.  I sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And what's funny is, now I don't mind bein' inside.  If I was out, even Born Again, I'd probably get restless again.  It's maybe better I stay here, what do you think?
L144921 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
L144920 +++$+++ u4629 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ DARYLL +++$+++ Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
L144919 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Ah ha.  What did he want?
L144918 +++$+++ u4629 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ DARYLL +++$+++ Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
L144917 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
L144916 +++$+++ u4629 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ DARYLL +++$+++ Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
L144915 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.
L144914 +++$+++ u4629 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ DARYLL +++$+++ I sent it by private courier, he didn't give it to you?  That son of a gun...!
L144913 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What book?
L144912 +++$+++ u4629 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ DARYLL +++$+++ You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet.
L144911 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Hello, Daryll Lee.
