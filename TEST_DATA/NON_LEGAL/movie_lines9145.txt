L290470 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
L290469 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
L290463 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Um, I'm Jerry... that's Bill... Denise and Mary.
L290462 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What do they call you, sweety?
L290461 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Oh, right.
L290460 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
L290459 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
L290590 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
L290589 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
L290567 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.
L290566 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ This is way too fucked up for words.
L290424 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Enough with the stupid voices.
L290423 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
L290420 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What!
L290419 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy.
L290390 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You didn't see the look she threw me. She's up to something.
L290389 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
L290388 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ That stupid hillbilly slut.
L290387 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Huh?
L290386 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.
L290347 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You said it, not me.
L290346 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'll go. It's my fault.
L290333 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?
L290332 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Just back up.
L290215 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Huh?
L290214 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy.
L290204 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Shit, it is only sprinkling and it's worth the trouble. Hold on for two seconds.
L290203 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
L290202 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'm gonna go ask him.
L290610 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Don't worry, I'm gone.
L290609 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I suggest you kids leave now.
L290497 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, even though I know it seems childish to you all. Tonight is Halloween eve and it special to us so you are all invited to stay for dinner.
L290496 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Sorry.
L290495 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I know you're my guests and welcome but I'd please advise you to keep from cussing while in my house, thank you.
L290481 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Oh really, well I hope something changes your mind some day.
L290480 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No, just a little too old.
L290479 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.
L290648 +++$+++ u1399 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized.
L290647 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What are you doing?  ...no, stop... please, please.
L290646 +++$+++ u1399 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way...  ...but if you'll notice...  right here, needs a little something, heh?
L290645 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Fuck you, you fucking freak!
L290644 +++$+++ u1399 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Oh, it's real... as real as I want it to be, mamma...  ...look, see the magic in my brush strokes.
L290643 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
L290642 +++$+++ u1399 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Behold... The Fish-Boy!
L290640 +++$+++ u1399 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Let's go see.
L290639 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Where is he?
L290638 +++$+++ u1399 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK.
L290637 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Where's Bill?
L290636 +++$+++ u1399 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
L290635 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Why? Why are you doing this?
L290802 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em before...  ...he looks familiar, is he on TV?
L290801 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ Think... do any of these kids look familiar in any way?
L290798 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Oh, you are very welcome... Lord knows how I love a man in uniform.
L290797 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ Thank you.
L290796 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Oh, alright... I guess I can trust you... being a man of the law and all.
L290795 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ Please, just a minute.
L290794 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I um... no, I don't think so...
L290793 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ Please, could I please come in and talk to you for a minute? Maybe you could take a better look at the picture... might stir up something.
L290792 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, I... mmmmm... no, I ain't seen her, sorry.
L290791 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
L290790 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
L290789 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
L290788 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
L290787 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
L290786 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well hello, officer.
L290869 +++$+++ u1399 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Well, go get her.
L290868 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
L290858 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Wait, I want to say good-bye.
L290857 +++$+++ u1399 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Get in... now!
L290830 +++$+++ u1399 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Yes! I'm the one who beats you when you're bad...
L290829 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Who's your Daddy!
L290828 +++$+++ u1399 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy... 
L290776 +++$+++ u1399 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do.
L290775 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What should I do?
L290774 +++$+++ u1399 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
L290773 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I don't know. I only saw one.
L290770 +++$+++ u1399 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ What! God damn, how many?
L290769 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.
L290552 +++$+++ u1399 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ I ain't sure that you really need to know. It's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs.
L290551 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Grampa... watch the language.
L290809 +++$+++ u1397 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MR. WILLIS +++$+++ Right.
L290808 +++$+++ u1398 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ NAISH +++$+++ Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down.
L290800 +++$+++ u1397 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MR. WILLIS +++$+++ Call Wydell.
L290799 +++$+++ u1398 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ NAISH +++$+++ Jesus Christ.
L290785 +++$+++ u1398 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ NAISH +++$+++ Shit... fuck procedure.
L290784 +++$+++ u1397 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MR. WILLIS +++$+++ Tell it to my daughter.
L290783 +++$+++ u1398 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ NAISH +++$+++ I ain't got a warrant.
L290782 +++$+++ u1397 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MR. WILLIS +++$+++ We gotta break it open.
L290780 +++$+++ u1397 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MR. WILLIS +++$+++ Over here, inside the smokehouse.
L290779 +++$+++ u1398 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ NAISH +++$+++ Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from?
L290778 +++$+++ u1397 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MR. WILLIS +++$+++ Shhhh... you hear that?
L290777 +++$+++ u1398 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ NAISH +++$+++ Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
L290765 +++$+++ u1397 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MR. WILLIS +++$+++ Where we headed?
L290764 +++$+++ u1398 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ NAISH +++$+++ Turn up this road.
L290761 +++$+++ u1397 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MR. WILLIS +++$+++ My Denise is a smart girl, she wouldn't do anything stupid, and her boyfriend, he always seemed like a good kid.
L290760 +++$+++ u1398 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ NAISH +++$+++ No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
L290759 +++$+++ u1397 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MR. WILLIS +++$+++ Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
L290750 +++$+++ u1398 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ NAISH +++$+++ No, not really. Good kid, never been in any trouble.
L290749 +++$+++ u1397 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MR. WILLIS +++$+++ Fit the profile?
L290748 +++$+++ u1398 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ NAISH +++$+++ Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.
L290739 +++$+++ u1397 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MR. WILLIS +++$+++ George Willis...  ...any leads?
L290738 +++$+++ u1398 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ NAISH +++$+++ Hey.
L290763 +++$+++ u1397 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MR. WILLIS +++$+++ I pray to God there is.
L290762 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
L290752 +++$+++ u1397 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MR. WILLIS +++$+++ Christ, you know it's crazy...  I lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know. Always cool and calm, but... but I never thought I'd be the one needing help, ya know?
L290751 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ Her part in this I can't figure... but I will.
L290747 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.
L290746 +++$+++ u1397 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MR. WILLIS +++$+++ What about the body you found?
L290743 +++$+++ u1397 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MR. WILLIS +++$+++ Dr. Satan?
L290742 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
L290741 +++$+++ u1397 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MR. WILLIS +++$+++ That's it?
L290740 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.
L290737 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ I'm Wydell... this is Naish.
L290736 +++$+++ u1397 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MR. WILLIS +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L290735 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ Mr. Willis?
L290806 +++$+++ u1398 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ NAISH +++$+++ We found one.
L290805 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ Over.
L290804 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ Excuse me for a second.
L290803 +++$+++ u1398 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ NAISH +++$+++ Wydell.
L290768 +++$+++ u1398 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ NAISH +++$+++ Right...  ...come on.
L290767 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
L290754 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
L290753 +++$+++ u1398 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ NAISH +++$+++ Don't worry, we'll find her.
L290745 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ Anyway, there's not much else out that way... so, I figure maybe there's a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms.
L290744 +++$+++ u1398 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ NAISH +++$+++ Yeah it's horseshit, just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with.
L290734 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ That must be him.
L290733 +++$+++ u1398 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ NAISH +++$+++ I guess not.
L290732 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
L290731 +++$+++ u1398 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ NAISH +++$+++ Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
L290730 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help.
L290729 +++$+++ u1398 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ NAISH +++$+++ You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird.
L290687 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ Call the chief... We found 'em.
L290686 +++$+++ u1398 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ NAISH +++$+++ Plates match.
L290685 +++$+++ u1398 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ NAISH +++$+++ What.
L290684 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ Aw, fuck.
L290683 +++$+++ u1398 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ NAISH +++$+++ Hulk was dumb as shit.
L290682 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ I always favored the Hulk.
L290681 +++$+++ u1398 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ NAISH +++$+++ You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
L290680 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
L290679 +++$+++ u1398 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ NAISH +++$+++ You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.
L290678 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
L290677 +++$+++ u1398 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ NAISH +++$+++ Your Spidey senses tingling.
L290676 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
L290675 +++$+++ u1398 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ NAISH +++$+++ Boss, the way I see it is these kids probally stop off somewhere, bought a bunch of booze and are off getting shitfaced.
L290651 +++$+++ u1398 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ NAISH +++$+++ Right.
L290650 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.
L294971 +++$+++ u1402 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ It's going famously, son, famously!
L294970 +++$+++ u1406 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Tell him, Harold.
L294497 +++$+++ u1402 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Son, your mother and I are doing a production of The Gin Game at the local community theater. We forgot to take off our make-up.
L294496 +++$+++ u1406 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Tell him, Harold.
L294445 +++$+++ u1402 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ And think about what you've done.
L294444 +++$+++ u1406 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ And?
L294443 +++$+++ u1402 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ No "buts." Go to your room now.
L294442 +++$+++ u1406 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Harold! Tell the boy again.
L294437 +++$+++ u1402 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ That is the wrong fork, young man.
L294436 +++$+++ u1406 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.
L294331 +++$+++ u1402 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Uh...  We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp.  A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?
L294330 +++$+++ u1406 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.
L294347 +++$+++ u1403 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ FEMALE ROOMMATE +++$+++ You're fucked up, Lila.  Why don't you fucking try electrolysis or something? Figure it out for chrissake.
L294346 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
L294345 +++$+++ u1403 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ FEMALE ROOMMATE +++$+++ Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
L294344 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
L294343 +++$+++ u1403 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ FEMALE ROOMMATE +++$+++ Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
L294342 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
L294341 +++$+++ u1403 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ FEMALE ROOMMATE +++$+++ It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
L294340 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ It's embarrassing, okay?
L294339 +++$+++ u1403 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ FEMALE ROOMMATE +++$+++ I don't know why you didn't tell me about this.
L294337 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Nothing! I'll be out in a minute!
L294336 +++$+++ u1403 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ FEMALE ROOMMATE +++$+++ Lila, what are you doing in there? I need to get ready for my date.
L295058 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ Oui.
L295057 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ French?
L295056 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ Let's go eat, I'm starved.
L295055 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Hush. No, it is never terrible to be in love. Nathan's memory lives on in our sacred union.  I'm not sorry she killed him either. Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite and sophisticated and charming. You are all that, too. But you have something more. You have a bit of the animal in you.
L295054 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not sorry she killed him, if it means I can have you. Is that a terrible thing to say, my sweet?
L295052 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ Woof.
L295051 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
L295050 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ Like father, like son.
L295049 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ You remind me so much of Nathan.

L295047 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Say my name.
L295046 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ Great.  God, I've wanted you forever.
L295045 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
L295044 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
L295043 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Hello, my little boy.
L294990 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Okay.
L294989 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ No.
L294988 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Please let me go with you.
L294987 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
L294986 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Okay, my sweet. Good night.
L294985 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.
L294984 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ You better believe they're dirty! And smelly! And messy! And they don't know their forks from their assholes!
L294983 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?
L294982 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
L294981 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Where do we look for little lost Puff?
L294980 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.
L294979 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ We still have you and I.
L294978 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
L294977 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Oui.
L294976 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ I want our boy back.
L294975 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ I don't know.
