L62474 +++$+++ u3846 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Wanta sue me?
L62473 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ You tossed my hat out the window.
L62467 +++$+++ u3846 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Beats me.
L62466 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ Think I'll take the juice?
L62455 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ I could've held off an army if I could've gotten behind a rock in the mountains.
L62454 +++$+++ u3846 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Hold it right there.
L62453 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ Hi.
L64058 +++$+++ u3848 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Then that's it!
L64057 +++$+++ u3856 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ NEW JERSEY +++$+++ Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
L64056 +++$+++ u3848 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
L64055 +++$+++ u3856 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ NEW JERSEY +++$+++ November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it?  Orson Welles!
L64052 +++$+++ u3848 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Forty-six Yoyodyne employees.  Grover's Mill, New Jersey, 11/1/38.
L64051 +++$+++ u3856 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ NEW JERSEY +++$+++ New Jersey?
L64050 +++$+++ u3848 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ All these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in New Jersey on the exact same date.
L64022 +++$+++ u3848 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Who're you?
L64021 +++$+++ u3856 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ NEW JERSEY +++$+++ So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!
L64182 +++$+++ u3851 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ CASPER LINDLEY +++$+++ They're stealing my chopper!
L64181 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ There's another one we owe 'em.
L64108 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.
L64107 +++$+++ u3851 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ CASPER LINDLEY +++$+++ Not me. No way.
L64106 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ You wanna take the chance, Casper?
L64105 +++$+++ u3851 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ CASPER LINDLEY +++$+++ She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--?
L64032 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll be worried.
L64031 +++$+++ u3851 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ CASPER LINDLEY +++$+++ Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.  Casper Lindley, Knight of the Blue Shield, at your disposal.  And my son, Scooter.
L63991 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-
L63990 +++$+++ u3860 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PROF. HIKITA +++$+++ Planet 10?
L63989 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
L63988 +++$+++ u3860 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PROF. HIKITA +++$+++ Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?
L63987 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ It's an antidote. A formula.  Whoever it was on the phone made me scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises.
L63986 +++$+++ u3860 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PROF. HIKITA +++$+++ It's your hand, Buckaroo.
L63985 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Ever since that phony phone call from the President.  Look at this. What is it?
L63983 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. Form the Eighth Dimension, I think.  Look...
L63982 +++$+++ u3860 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PROF. HIKITA +++$+++ What?
L63981 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than flapjacks.
L63980 +++$+++ u3860 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PROF. HIKITA +++$+++ Buckaroo!  What the Sam Hill!
L63892 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
L63891 +++$+++ u3860 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PROF. HIKITA +++$+++ We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!
L63882 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
L63881 +++$+++ u3860 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PROF. HIKITA +++$+++ Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...
L63773 +++$+++ u3860 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PROF. HIKITA +++$+++ Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.
L63772 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Smells fermented.  Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.
L63746 +++$+++ u3860 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PROF. HIKITA +++$+++ The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?
L63745 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...
L64180 +++$+++ u3861 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RAWHIDE +++$+++ Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
L64179 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ We will, old fried, we will.
L64173 +++$+++ u3861 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RAWHIDE +++$+++ So I was right.  That's nice to know...
L64172 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Arachtoid.
L64171 +++$+++ u3861 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RAWHIDE +++$+++ Apache?
L64170 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Just 'grazed' you, huh?
L64169 +++$+++ u3861 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RAWHIDE +++$+++ You're a welcome sight...
L64162 +++$+++ u3861 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RAWHIDE +++$+++ Yeah. Just grazed me.  The Professor's under the floor too...with the Overthruster...
L64161 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ You okay?
L63950 +++$+++ u3861 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RAWHIDE +++$+++ Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems?  You think they're mixed up in this?
L63949 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
L63948 +++$+++ u3861 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RAWHIDE +++$+++ What crate?
L63947 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ The deuce you say.  That crate!
L63946 +++$+++ u3861 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RAWHIDE +++$+++ Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
L63945 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
L63911 +++$+++ u3861 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RAWHIDE +++$+++ And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.
L63910 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
L63834 +++$+++ u3861 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RAWHIDE +++$+++ He went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, got caught and judged insane.  The professor told us they threw away the key.
L63833 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
L63832 +++$+++ u3861 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RAWHIDE +++$+++ The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange...
L63830 +++$+++ u3861 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RAWHIDE +++$+++ First thing I did.
L63829 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Have you warned Professor Hikita?
L63828 +++$+++ u3861 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RAWHIDE +++$+++ Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours.
L63824 +++$+++ u3861 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RAWHIDE +++$+++ Vanished. Thin air.
L63823 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Then what?
L63771 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Same one you had yesterday?
L63770 +++$+++ u3861 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RAWHIDE +++$+++ Got a half a tuna sandwich.
L63769 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ I'm starving...somebody, help.
L64416 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  Quite a guy if you want my opinion.
L64415 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ All accounted for?  Where's Penny?
L64235 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?
L64234 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.
L64154 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ Where's the professor?
L64153 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Dead.  Damnit!
L64148 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ Sam's dead!  Someone broke into the Jet Car! And things are going haywire over at the lab...
L64147 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ What is it, Tommy?
L64146 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ Buckaroo--! Sorry--
L64089 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ It?  Who does?
L64088 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
L64081 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
L64080 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?
L63879 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ Let her out?  She's a killer.
L63878 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Let her out. In my custody.
L63877 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ Running a little late, Buckaroo.
L63836 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
L63835 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?
L63790 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ I look great.  Let's rock 'n' roll.
L63789 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Everybody ready?  How do we look?  Do we look okay?
L63786 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ She wants a picture.
L63785 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Not really.  This is pretty important.
L63784 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
L63778 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?
L63777 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Anybody we know?
L64410 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Now!
L64409 +++$+++ u3854 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ JOHN PARKER +++$+++ Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
L64408 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!
L64403 +++$+++ u3854 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ JOHN PARKER +++$+++ Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.
L64402 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Does this thing have guns, John Parker?
L64398 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!
L64397 +++$+++ u3854 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ JOHN PARKER +++$+++ I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.
L64382 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ The door's locked.
L64381 +++$+++ u3854 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ JOHN PARKER +++$+++ We're going down!  Onto the runway!
L64372 +++$+++ u3854 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ JOHN PARKER +++$+++ Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai.  I failed flight school.
L64371 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ What is this thing?  A fighter?
L64246 +++$+++ u3854 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ JOHN PARKER +++$+++ They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
L64245 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
L64419 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ And ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill?  No way.  Send 'em back to the Eighth Dimension as soon as we find the Overthruster.  It wasn't in Penny's purse...so if we have to run this joint upside down and inside out...
L64418 +++$+++ u3862 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RENO +++$+++ Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
L64417 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Got a casualty list?
L64232 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
L64231 +++$+++ u3862 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RENO +++$+++ They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.
L64184 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Don't shoot!
L64183 +++$+++ u3862 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RENO +++$+++ And they got Penny!  Look!
L64111 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ To get my guns.
L64110 +++$+++ u3862 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RENO +++$+++ Where're you goin'?
L64087 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  Of course!  What else?
L64086 +++$+++ u3862 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RENO +++$+++ ...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded...
L64083 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?
L64082 +++$+++ u3862 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RENO +++$+++ ...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...
L64078 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ What? How do you know that?
L64077 +++$+++ u3862 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RENO +++$+++ They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!
L63775 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?
L63774 +++$+++ u3862 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RENO +++$+++ And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield.
L64240 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Penny--?!  Are you all right?
L64239 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
L64150 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
L64149 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Stay here, I'll be back.
L64145 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ That's just what you would say.  This is so unreal.  I'm dreaming...
L64144 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ It's too dangerous.
L64143 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go with you.  Please...
L64142 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Absolutely.
L64141 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ Believe in Penny Priddy?
L64140 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
L64139 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
L64138 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
L64137 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ Go where?  Where're you going?
L64136 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
L64135 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
L64134 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Never.
L64132 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ I wish he was.  He's real enough.
L64131 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
L64130 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
L64129 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
L64128 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ You don't wanna know.
L64127 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ How did she die?  I wanna know.
L64126 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
L64125 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
L64124 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.
L64123 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ Oh, my.
L64122 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ She was killed, Penny.
L64121 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
L64114 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me.
L64113 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Open up or I'll shoot it off.
L63904 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ Any time.
L63903 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ You keep an eye on it.
L63876 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Who does?  It's a crazy mixed-up world.  Just do the best you can with what you have...
L63875 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
L63874 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
L63873 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
L63872 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Another 'you'?

L63870 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Did you have family there--? A sister?  In Cody?
L63869 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ Which?  The one in my throat.
L63868 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
L63867 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ No, I don't.
L63866 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
L63865 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
L63864 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
L63863 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me.
L63862 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ It's kinda hard this way.
L63861 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
L63860 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ The girl I remind you of.
L63859 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Who?
L63858 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ Was she pretty?
L63857 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Pretty terrible shot.
L63856 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ You.  Like the papers all say.
L63855 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Who were you really trying to kill last night?
L63854 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ Go away.  Let me rot?
L63853 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
L63852 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
L63810 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Everybody okay up here?

L63808 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ My name's, Penny!  But who cares?
L63807 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
L63805 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
L63804 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ He offered you money?
L63803 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
L63802 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?
L63801 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  I'm a nobody.
L63800 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Did you say..."Peggy"?
L63799 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
L63798 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
L63797 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ This is so embarrassing...
L63796 +++$+++ u3849 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI +++$+++ Raise your hand...where?
L64216 +++$+++ u3859 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PRESIDENT WIDMARK +++$+++ You're quite serious about this, aren't you, Buckaroo.  We know each other pretty well, I think.
L64215 +++$+++ u3850 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV +++$+++ A thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  These creatures from Planet 10 are ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.
