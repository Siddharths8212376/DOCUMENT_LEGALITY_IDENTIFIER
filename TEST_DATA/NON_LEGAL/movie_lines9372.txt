L503545 +++$+++ u2720 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
L503544 +++$+++ u2716 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ Poor Brad.

L503524 +++$+++ u2720 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ They call it a new look at an old favourite I copied it from the 'Window on the World' show.  The Far East meets the Mid-West!
L503522 +++$+++ u2720 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ I know.
L503521 +++$+++ u2716 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
L503520 +++$+++ u2720 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Oh my poor baby.
L503571 +++$+++ u2726 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Don't worry, Janet.  Brad'll probably get just what he needs.
L503570 +++$+++ u2716 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ Thanks Officer Park...Vance.
L503569 +++$+++ u2726 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Dentonvale...say, that's for...  I'm sorry to hear that, Janet.  Look I'm going to let you through, but keep it to yourself, otherwise...
L503568 +++$+++ u2716 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.

L503964 +++$+++ u2716 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ I never signed the contract.  He's not going anywhere.

L503798 +++$+++ u2716 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...
L503797 +++$+++ u2718 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Brad!
L503748 +++$+++ u2718 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Of course.  He was in great danger of harming himself.
L503747 +++$+++ u2716 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ . . .For his own good.
L503689 +++$+++ u2718 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BOY DRESSING UP HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GREATEST JOY BUT WHEN IT'S TIME TO BE DISCREET THERE'S ONE THING YOU JUST CAN'T BEAT THAT'S A STRAPLESS, BACKLESS CLASSICAL LITTLE BLACK
L503688 +++$+++ u2716 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
L503687 +++$+++ u2718 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!
L503686 +++$+++ u2716 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ Do you really think so?
L503685 +++$+++ u2718 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
L503684 +++$+++ u2716 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
L503683 +++$+++ u2718 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ You are the most desirable creature that ever walked.
L503682 +++$+++ u2718 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
L503681 +++$+++ u2716 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
L503678 +++$+++ u2718 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ I understand your concern, but I feel it's time you started thinking of yourself.  Look at yourself.
L503677 +++$+++ u2716 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ I want to see Brad.
L503630 +++$+++ u2718 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ It's classical.  Almost a textbook case...
L503629 +++$+++ u2716 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ Me?
L503628 +++$+++ u2718 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you.
L503610 +++$+++ u2718 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
L503609 +++$+++ u2716 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ I'm...happy.
L503501 +++$+++ u2716 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ No...couldn't I do this later?
L503500 +++$+++ u2718 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Just one or two details.  Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
L503490 +++$+++ u2718 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
L503489 +++$+++ u2716 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ No!  He's never done that before.

L503644 +++$+++ u2721 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ NATION +++$+++ This is the nerve center of operations, Janet.  You must stay here tonight.  That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.
L503632 +++$+++ u2721 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ NATION +++$+++ Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
L503631 +++$+++ u2718 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ That's an extremely negative response.
L503608 +++$+++ u2721 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ NATION +++$+++ Yes how are you, Janet?  Are you happy?
L503607 +++$+++ u2718 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ It's you we're concerned about, Janet.
L503593 +++$+++ u2718 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ What does he know about it?
L503592 +++$+++ u2721 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ NATION +++$+++ Our field.
L503543 +++$+++ u2721 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ NATION +++$+++ I don't think he intends to go that far.
L503542 +++$+++ u2718 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ HE!!??  How dare this person take advantage of my weakness.
L503533 +++$+++ u2718 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ I can't wait to begin on him. Really, Bert, I don't know what we'd do without you!
L503532 +++$+++ u2721 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ NATION +++$+++ Our speciality.
L503485 +++$+++ u2721 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ NATION +++$+++ We understand you've been going through a rather trying time.

L503883 +++$+++ u2727 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ THIS COULD TAKE US TO A TOWN THAT'S NOWHERE NEAR HERE
L503882 +++$+++ u2719 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ MACY +++$+++ LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
L503881 +++$+++ u2727 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
L503809 +++$+++ u2727 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ ...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
L503808 +++$+++ u2719 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ MACY +++$+++ So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
L503777 +++$+++ u2719 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ MACY +++$+++ Surely.
L503776 +++$+++ u2727 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
L503775 +++$+++ u2719 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ MACY +++$+++ Hi!  Macy Struthers -- co-host on the F. F. show.
L503942 +++$+++ u2721 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ NATION +++$+++ We all love Janet...Who do we love?

L503939 +++$+++ u2720 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
L503938 +++$+++ u2721 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ NATION +++$+++ Isn't she lovely?
L503758 +++$+++ u2720 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ We're not confused.
L503757 +++$+++ u2721 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ NATION +++$+++ And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.
L503753 +++$+++ u2721 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ NATION +++$+++ No.
L503752 +++$+++ u2720 +++$+++ m177 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ And none of them worked?
L504961 +++$+++ u2731 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CAMMI +++$+++ Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from "One Life to Live"?
L504960 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
L504959 +++$+++ u2731 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CAMMI +++$+++ I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
L504958 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No, we're from San Diego. Why?
L504957 +++$+++ u2731 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CAMMI +++$+++ It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
L504956 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Nice technique there...  ...Cammi.
L505013 +++$+++ u2731 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CAMMI +++$+++ The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
L505012 +++$+++ u2736 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ The fuck was that?
L505011 +++$+++ u2731 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CAMMI +++$+++ I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
L505010 +++$+++ u2736 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
L505009 +++$+++ u2731 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CAMMI +++$+++ I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
L505008 +++$+++ u2736 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
L505007 +++$+++ u2731 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CAMMI +++$+++ I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
L505006 +++$+++ u2736 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
L504121 +++$+++ u2732 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ Bye.
L504120 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I love you.
L504119 +++$+++ u2732 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ Bye.
L504118 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
L504117 +++$+++ u2732 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
L504116 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
L504115 +++$+++ u2732 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ Why are you being so defensive?
L504114 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Honey, I'm just saying you know I need a little space before the wedding. Isn't that the point of this? Isn't that what we talked about with Dr. Gertler?
L504113 +++$+++ u2732 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
L504112 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
L504111 +++$+++ u2732 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
L504110 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
L504109 +++$+++ u2732 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
L504108 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, then put him at the singles table.
L504107 +++$+++ u2732 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --
L504104 +++$+++ u2732 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ Just seeing how you're doing. And, um, Mom and I were starting to look over the seating charts again, and we're wondering if you wanted Tony Levin to sit next to the Feldmans, or should he be at one of the singles tables?
L504103 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ So what's up?
L504102 +++$+++ u2732 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ Good. That's good.
L504101 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
L504100 +++$+++ u2732 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ You guys having fun?
L504099 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It's Christine.  Hey you.
L504052 +++$+++ u2732 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ It'll just take a second.
L504051 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Don't bother him with that. We got to get going.
L504891 +++$+++ u2733 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ You're a wonderful writer, Miles. Don't be discouraged.
L504890 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ So I guess that's it.
L504889 +++$+++ u2733 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
L504888 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah, I'm here.
L504887 +++$+++ u2733 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Are you there? Miles?
L504886 +++$+++ u2733 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I'm sorry, Miles.  So I don't know where that leaves us. I'm not sure how much more mileage I can get out of continuing to submit it. I think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now -- a fabulous book with no home. The whole industry's gotten gutless. It's not about the quality of the books. It's about the marketing.
L504885 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Huh.
L504884 +++$+++ u2733 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
L504883 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ And?
L504882 +++$+++ u2733 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
L504881 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
L504880 +++$+++ u2733 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ How's the trip?
L504879 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
L504878 +++$+++ u2733 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Miles.
L504742 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I'm good.
L504741 +++$+++ u2734 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ You okay, Miles?
L504739 +++$+++ u2734 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Maya? Haven't seen her. I think she's off tonight. Say, where's your buddy?
L504738 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Say, is Maya working?
L504737 +++$+++ u2734 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ You got it.
L504736 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Bottle.
L504735 +++$+++ u2734 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Glass or bottle?
L504734 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Highliner.
L504733 +++$+++ u2734 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
L504732 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
L504731 +++$+++ u2734 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ How's it hanging, Miles?
L504282 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
L504281 +++$+++ u2734 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ What do you think?
L504280 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.
L504279 +++$+++ u2734 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
L504278 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What are you pouring tonight?
L504277 +++$+++ u2734 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ My condolences.
L504276 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
