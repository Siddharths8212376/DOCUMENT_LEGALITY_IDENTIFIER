L237888 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ REDBEARD +++$+++ Nobody's seen anything like this. Lions don't have caves like this-  -they're doing it for pleasure.
L237887 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ Their den?  Have you ever seen anything like this?
L237885 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ REDBEARD +++$+++ I got big. 
L237884 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ What happened to them?
L237883 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ REDBEARD +++$+++ In my town, when I was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place.  But he was not the problem. He had a brother who was worse than he. But the brother was not the problem.  One or the other of them was usually in jail. The problem came when they were both free togther. The two became different from either alone.  Alone they were only brutes. Together they became lethal, together they killed.
L237882 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn... 
L237881 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ REDBEARD +++$+++ It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I	suppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and... 
L237879 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ REDBEARD +++$+++ In point of fact it didn't- but I'm convinced the idea is sound.
L237878 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ But of course yours worked.
L237877 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ REDBEARD +++$+++ Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea?  Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once.
L237876 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ REDBEARD +++$+++ It's all right. Stay ready.  They know it's there.
L237875 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ Goddammit!
L237874 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ REDBEARD +++$+++ Only in life... 
L237873 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ Have you ever failed?
L237872 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ REDBEARD +++$+++ Think about something else.
L237865 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ ...don't know...
L237864 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ REDBEARD +++$+++ Has it ever done that before?
L237863 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ ...misfire... it jammed...
L237858 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ REDBEARD +++$+++ You'd never force the lion to me- and nobody ever got a lion with one shot by luck.  Around there's a clearing- you'll know it from the anthills- get there and hide and listen to the sounds- I'll make the lion come directly to you. 
L237857 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
L237856 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ REDBEARD +++$+++ Samuel says you killed a lion.
L237855 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ I can try.
L237854 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ REDBEARD +++$+++ The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers?
L237839 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ REDBEARD +++$+++ No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
L237838 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ Have you got it?
L237828 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ REDBEARD +++$+++ I'm always considerate- my mother taught me that.
L237827 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ That's very considerate.
L237826 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ REDBEARD +++$+++ I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out-  -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you.
L237814 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ Somehow I guessed. 
L237813 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ REDBEARD +++$+++ All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard. 
L237812 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ Actually, no.
L237811 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ REDBEARD +++$+++ Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
L237810 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ We need to talk.
L237809 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ REDBEARD +++$+++ Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. 
L237808 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ Got me out of trouble.
L237807 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ REDBEARD +++$+++ What did I do?
L237806 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ I didn't have a chance to thank you.
L237941 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ It's all right, Samuel- we all get hit- 
L237940 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ Afraid of lions.
L237939 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ Underneath.  Somewhere.
L237938 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ Where is it?
L237932 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ Once... 
L237931 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ He has children?
L237926 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ I feel the same about the bridge. This country certainly didn't ask for it, doesn't need it.
L237925 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ Three years I've worked for the railroad. Now I don't know why. It seemed a good idea once.
L237852 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ He doesn't. He needs nobody. But we have hunted many times...  ...he knows I am afraid of lions...
L237851 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ Thank you.  Why does he need you by him?
L237834 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ Since his beard was red.
L237833 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ You've known him long?
L237832 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ Oh yes. But it takes time.
L237831 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ You like him, don't you?
L237825 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ I have to ask- why do you need me?
L237824 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ Soon. 
L237724 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ You give me hope, John. 
L237723 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ I do, actually; very much.
L237722 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ Do you love her?
L237721 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ I expect so- it's from my wife.
L237720 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ Good news?
L237719 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ Thank you, Samuel.
L237718 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ For you.
L237713 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
L237712 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ Oh yes, I think so. 
L237705 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge.
L237704 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.
L237688 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ You don't know what Tsavo means, do you?  It means "slaughter"...
L237687 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ Nonsense.
L237686 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ You- they cannot believe you're still here.
L237685 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ What are they looking at?
L237638 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
L237637 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ I am also liaison between these two.
L237629 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ This is more difficult-
L237628 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ Did it look like this in your mind?
L237625 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ Get on? They detest each other. Obviously the Africans hate the Indians. But the Indians also hate the other Indians. Some of them worship cows, while others eat them. 
L237624 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ The workers don't get on?
L237623 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
L237622 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job.
L237621 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge. 
L237620 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ PATTERSON +++$+++ Why do the workers look unhappy?
L237930 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ REDBEARD +++$+++ Hold your son high. 
L237929 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ Some mysteries should not have solutions.
L237928 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ REDBEARD +++$+++ My life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder. Our lives have crossed because two lions went mad. But what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity? Was that worth all the lives? Too soon to tell.
L237923 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ Help finish the railroad.
L237922 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ REDBEARD +++$+++ Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
L237921 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ Where do you go next?
L237871 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ REDBEARD +++$+++ Patterson and I will be in the old hospital- where the enticing smell of sickness still lingers-  -and by the time we're done, I promise you, the odor of blood will be irresistible. 
L237870 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ And where will you sleep beautifully?
L237869 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ REDBEARD +++$+++ Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell at all here, and little blood. When we leave, close the gate securely, don't open it til morning and keep your fires high. Any questions, ask them now.  You two will sleep beautifully in your tents.  And stay there.
L237862 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ REDBEARD +++$+++ Not even close.  What happened?
L237861 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ Did you ever see a lion that size?
L237841 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ REDBEARD +++$+++ Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men.
L237840 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ Why so many?
L237837 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ They will want a lot of money.
L237836 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ REDBEARD +++$+++ Four should do it.
L237835 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ How many cattle?
L237830 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ I don't believe you had a mother. 
L237829 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m73 +++$+++ REDBEARD +++$+++ Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
L239472 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ I'd rather not.
L239471 +++$+++ u1125 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ JANOSZ +++$+++ Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
L239470 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
L239469 +++$+++ u1125 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ JANOSZ +++$+++ I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
L239468 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ We don't have a relationship.
L239467 +++$+++ u1125 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ JANOSZ +++$+++ Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
L239370 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ I don't care who he is.  He's not taking my baby.
L239369 +++$+++ u1125 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ JANOSZ +++$+++ Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
L239368 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Everybody has a choice.
L239367 +++$+++ u1125 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ JANOSZ +++$+++ I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
L239366 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
L239365 +++$+++ u1125 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ JANOSZ +++$+++ No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
L239364 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ What do you want with my baby?
L239083 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
L239082 +++$+++ u1125 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ JANOSZ +++$+++ Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
L238961 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Good night, Janosz.
L238960 +++$+++ u1125 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ JANOSZ +++$+++ Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
L238959 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
L238958 +++$+++ u1125 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ JANOSZ +++$+++ Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?
L238956 +++$+++ u1125 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ JANOSZ +++$+++ Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?
L238955 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Janosz?
L238809 +++$+++ u1125 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ JANOSZ +++$+++ Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.
L238808 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
L238807 +++$+++ u1125 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ JANOSZ +++$+++ Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do.  Do I have bad breath or something?
L238806 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
L238805 +++$+++ u1125 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ JANOSZ +++$+++ We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
L238804 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra.
L238803 +++$+++ u1125 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ JANOSZ +++$+++ You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
L238802 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
L238836 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Thank you.
L238835 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ I won't.
L238834 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
L238833 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ Certainly.
L238832 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?
L238827 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ No.  Not that I can recall.
L238826 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Does he ever mention me?
L238825 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
L238824 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ How is he these days?
L238823 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ Occasionally
L238822 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Do you ever see him?
L238821 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ Oh no.
L238820 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
L238819 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
L238817 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters.
L238816 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ What are you working on, Egon?
L238813 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.
L238812 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
L238747 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ That's exactly what you said last week.
L238746 +++$+++ u1122 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Okay, that's no problem.
L238745 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ No, you didn't, Frank.
L238744 +++$+++ u1122 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Didn't I do it?
L238743 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
L238742 +++$+++ u1122 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
L238741 +++$+++ u1122 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
L238740 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Thank you, Frank.  I'll get the hang of this eventually.
L238739 +++$+++ u1122 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
L238738 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ You're also a human being, Frank.
L238737 +++$+++ u1122 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
L238736 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
L239537 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.
L239536 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ That's a terrible thing to say.
L239533 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Same difference.
L239532 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ That's not true.  It was 1620.
L239500 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Finally came to your senses, huh?
L239499 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
L239272 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.
L239271 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Maybe I should call Janine.
L239270 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Let me jingle you right now.
L239269 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
L239268 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
L239267 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
L239266 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ I'm not even good for me.
L239265 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
L239264 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
L239263 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
L239262 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
L239261 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
L239260 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
L239224 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ I have a hamper?  Next time ask me first, okay.  I have more than two grades of laundry.  There're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty.
L239223 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
L239222 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
L239221 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner.
L239220 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
L239219 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Does she know anything about babies?
L239218 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
L239217 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
L239216 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
L239215 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
L239213 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?
L239212 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Are you all squeaky clean now?
L239153 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ I'll put him down for you.  You are way too short!  And your belly-button sticks out!  You're nothing but a burden to your poor mother!
L239152 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
L239151 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Or we could do that.
L239150 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
L239149 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
L239148 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
L239147 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.
L239145 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.
L239144 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
L239141 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Sounds like another slime job ... No, they're all right.  They're here now ... Right ... Let me know.
L239140 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ It was full of this awful pink ooze.
L239139 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
L239138 +++$+++ u1120 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Peter, what about the bathtub?
L239137 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
