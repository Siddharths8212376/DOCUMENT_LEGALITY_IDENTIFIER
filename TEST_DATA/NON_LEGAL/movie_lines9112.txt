L261074 +++$+++ u1238 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
L261073 +++$+++ u1235 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ My, God!  What have you done to him?
L261071 +++$+++ u1235 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ Danny, go downstairs -- Now!
L261070 +++$+++ u1238 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from --
L261271 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ Leave the boy.  Take me.
L261270 +++$+++ u1239 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ WYNN +++$+++ Stay away, Sam.
L261269 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ No!!!
L261256 +++$+++ u1239 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ WYNN +++$+++ Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
L261255 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ You've created a monster.
L261249 +++$+++ u1239 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ WYNN +++$+++ And I'm its deliverer.  Its calling card, if you will.  I follow it.  Protect it. Act as its guardian.  In a sense, Sam, so do you.
L261248 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ Samhain.
L261247 +++$+++ u1239 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ WYNN +++$+++ There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
L261246 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ Jamie's baby ...
L261245 +++$+++ u1239 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ WYNN +++$+++ She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
L261244 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ Why did you take Jamie?
L261243 +++$+++ u1239 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ WYNN +++$+++ Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
L261242 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ It was you.
L261241 +++$+++ u1239 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ WYNN +++$+++ Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
L261240 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ This is madness, Wynn.
L261239 +++$+++ u1239 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ WYNN +++$+++ Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.
L261238 +++$+++ u1239 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ WYNN +++$+++ Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. Somehow I knew you still had it in you.
L261237 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ Where's the child?
L261093 +++$+++ u1239 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ WYNN +++$+++ I'll meet you over there.
L261092 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
L261089 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
L261088 +++$+++ u1239 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ WYNN +++$+++ No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
L261087 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ Any word on the location of the Strodes?
L261086 +++$+++ u1239 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ WYNN +++$+++ There's more people moving eastbound down Old Reservoir Road past the elementary school.
L261019 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ An old friend.
L261018 +++$+++ u1239 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ WYNN +++$+++ There you are.  Who was that boy?
L260996 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live. You have to.
L260995 +++$+++ u1239 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ WYNN +++$+++ Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.
L260974 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ It's a sign.  He's come home.
L260973 +++$+++ u1239 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ WYNN +++$+++ What is that?
L260911 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ Or what's left of him.
L260910 +++$+++ u1239 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ WYNN +++$+++ Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.  If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.
L260906 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ That's what someone wants us to believe, but I tell you Michael is alive.  I feel him.  I sense the evil that lives inside, just as I did all those years as I watched him.  Sitting behind these very same walls.  Staring. Growing stronger.  As my colleague, as my friend, please. I can't go through this again.  Not alone.  I need your help to stop him.
L260905 +++$+++ u1239 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ WYNN +++$+++ After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
L260904 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
L260903 +++$+++ u1239 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ WYNN +++$+++ You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
L260902 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me.
L260887 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ Please try to understand, Terence. I've already made up my mind.
L260886 +++$+++ u1239 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ WYNN +++$+++ But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules.  Just think it over.
L260880 +++$+++ u1239 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ WYNN +++$+++ You're the only man for the job, Sam. Things haven't been the same since you left.  I'm recruiting the best psychiatric team in the country.  Old colleagues.  This is your change to finally make a difference.
L260879 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
L260878 +++$+++ u1239 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ WYNN +++$+++ We need you, Dr. Loomis.
L260875 +++$+++ u1239 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ WYNN +++$+++ Retiring.
L260874 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ But surely Rogers isn't --
L260873 +++$+++ u1239 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ WYNN +++$+++ As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
L260872 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.
L260871 +++$+++ u1239 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ WYNN +++$+++ Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. Remember what Freud said:  'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.'  Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink.
L260868 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.
L260867 +++$+++ u1239 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ WYNN +++$+++ Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!
L261229 +++$+++ u1238 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ No!!!
L261228 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
L261226 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ Only me --  -- and Dr. Wynn.
L261225 +++$+++ u1238 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
L261224 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ No one.
L261223 +++$+++ u1238 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Who else knew I had the baby?!
L261014 +++$+++ u1238 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.
L261013 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
L261012 +++$+++ u1238 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
L261011 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ What do you know about Michael?
L261010 +++$+++ u1238 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael Myers come home?
L261009 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
L261008 +++$+++ u1238 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ I'm Tommy.  Tommy Doyle.  Laurie Strode -- Jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting for me that night --
L261007 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ I'm sorry, but do I know you --
L261006 +++$+++ u1238 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
L261005 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ Yes?
L268150 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Goodbye, Looseleaf.
L268149 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
L268148 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ They were enemies.  We were at war.
L268147 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
L268146 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ If what?
L268145 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I don't think so.  It could have been.
L268144 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
L268143 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
L268142 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Everybody thinks that.
L268141 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I know you think that.
L268140 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You're an imbecile.
L268139 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Okay.  Okay.
L268138 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You.
L268137 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Me?
L268136 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Maybe it's time you got out.
L268135 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
L268134 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You did?
L268133 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ You never played a violin.
L268132 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Tit for tat--as simple as that.
L268131 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
L268130 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ In what way, pray tell?
L268129 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
L268128 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What's this?
L268127 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Go live in a safe-deposit box--with your things. LOOSELEAF Jesus--I wouldn't want to be married to him.  You know?
L268090 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Shut up, you ninny!  You were never to come here again-- for any reason whatsoever!
L268089 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Hi, Penelope.
L268071 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ She was always a rotten wife!  She was against everything manly you ever wanted to do.  He was the most daring test pilot in the country at one time, and his wife made him quit.  She made him become a life insurance salesman instead.
L268070 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I dunno.
L268069 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
L268068 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
L268067 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ All the more reason to go to Africa.
L268066 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore.
L268065 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.
L268064 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I dunno.
L268063 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Of course you'll go!  You're going to fly the helicopter.
L268051 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ He's a man.  Tell him you're a man.
L268050 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ So, kid--how they hanging?  Or don't you say that to a little kid?
L268043 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ You keep on saying "deep" and "deeply." I wish something good would happen on the surface sometime.
L268042 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.
L268041 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I told you the uniform wouldn't help.
L268027 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Every time I start thinking like that I get the clap.
L268026 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
L268025 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I didn't know we had any women left.
L268024 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
L268023 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
L268022 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
L268021 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
L268020 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
L268019 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Go to the funeral?
L267948 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Sorry.
L267947 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
L267946 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Really?
L267945 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
L267944 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Oh.  I'd forgotten.
L267943 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
L267942 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ When?
L267941 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ You told me.
L267940 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ How do you know that?
L267939 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
L267938 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
L267937 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Huh.
L267936 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
L267935 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Excuse me.
L267930 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ You know me, boy.
L267929 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What's funny about that?
L267928 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
L267927 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
L267926 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The educational process.
L267925 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I dunno, boy.
L267898 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ How about breakfast, wife?
L267897 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ First Nagasaki--now this.
L267896 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Could have happened to anybody.
L267883 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.
L267882 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Otherwise, how are things?
L267875 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Let's talk about something else.
L267874 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ And how were things?
L267871 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Haven't got one.
L267870 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
L267869 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ You ever own a motorcycle?
L267868 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Go home!
L267867 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I've been looking at motorcycles.
L267504 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I'm lonesome already.
L267503 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways.
L267502 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Months?
L267501 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!
L267500 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ You know what gets me?  Those guys who went to the moon!  To the moon, boy!
L267498 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Something very important about sex must have happened while we were gone.
L267497 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
L267496 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ How short the skirts are.
L267495 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Let's talk about it some other time.
L267494 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ You know what gets me?
L267493 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ So long, Colonel.
L267492 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.
L267491 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
L267490 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I'm liable to find anything!
L267489 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Go home.
