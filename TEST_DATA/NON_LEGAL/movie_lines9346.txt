L461471 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ She never left the apartment --
L461470 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I think they missed their chance with her.
L461469 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it.  Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife.
L461464 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I was jaywalking.
L461463 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ By the way  what happened to your leg?
L461459 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Do that.
L461458 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
L461457 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Thanks.
L461456 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity.
L461455 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ All right -- you don't believe me.
L461454 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ You told me.  I've got to run, Jeff.
L461453 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ She -- was -- an -- invalid!
L461452 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ His wife took a trip.
L461451 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ For instance?
L461450 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
L461449 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ You think I made all this up?
L461448 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
L461447 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I'll bet it's been done.
L461446 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
L461445 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Well, officer -- do your duty.
L461444 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there --  -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.
L461443 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand.
L461442 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
L461441 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
L461440 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?
L461310 +++$+++ u2573 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ GUNNISON +++$+++ Yeah.
L461309 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
L461308 +++$+++ u2573 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ GUNNISON +++$+++ Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
L461307 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
L461306 +++$+++ u2573 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ GUNNISON +++$+++ Jeff --
L461305 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
L461304 +++$+++ u2573 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ GUNNISON +++$+++ Something wrong?
L461303 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ It's me.
L461302 +++$+++ u2573 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ GUNNISON +++$+++ Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
L461301 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Gunnison?
L461300 +++$+++ u2573 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ GUNNISON +++$+++ Hello.
L461104 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Next time, have some good news.
L461103 +++$+++ u2573 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ GUNNISON +++$+++ Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
L461102 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts they discuss -- but in my neighborhood, they still nag.
L461101 +++$+++ u2573 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ GUNNISON +++$+++ Jeff -- wives don't nag anymore -- they discuss.
L461100 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
L461099 +++$+++ u2573 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ GUNNISON +++$+++ It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
L461098 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
L461097 +++$+++ u2573 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ GUNNISON +++$+++ Like what?
L461096 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
L461095 +++$+++ u2573 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ GUNNISON +++$+++ I'll send you some comic books.
L461094 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
L461093 +++$+++ u2573 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ GUNNISON +++$+++ Read some good books.
L461091 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ You've got to get me out of here! Six weeks -- sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors!
L461090 +++$+++ u2573 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ GUNNISON +++$+++ So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
L461089 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
L461088 +++$+++ u2573 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ GUNNISON +++$+++ I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
L461087 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
L461086 +++$+++ u2573 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ GUNNISON +++$+++ You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
L461085 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
L461084 +++$+++ u2573 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ GUNNISON +++$+++ With that cast on -- you don't.
L461083 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
L461082 +++$+++ u2573 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ GUNNISON +++$+++ You did.
L461081 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
L461080 +++$+++ u2573 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ GUNNISON +++$+++ Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.
L461079 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Where?
L461075 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Yeah. I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison. Must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week.
L461074 +++$+++ u2573 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ GUNNISON +++$+++ That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day. Forget I called.
L461073 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.
L461072 +++$+++ u2573 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ GUNNISON +++$+++ Wrong day?
L461071 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
L461070 +++$+++ u2573 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ GUNNISON +++$+++ This is Wednesday.
L461069 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Who said I was getting rid of it?
L461068 +++$+++ u2573 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ GUNNISON +++$+++ For getting rid of that cast.
L461067 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ For what?
L461066 +++$+++ u2573 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ GUNNISON +++$+++ Congratulations, Jeff.
L461065 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Jefferies.
L461885 +++$+++ u2579 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ THORWALD +++$+++ Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!
L461884 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I can't. The police have it by now.
L461883 +++$+++ u2579 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ THORWALD +++$+++ Tell her to bring it back!
L461882 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No.
L461881 +++$+++ u2579 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ THORWALD +++$+++ Can you get me that ring back?
L461798 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ That's a start. I'm at the Brevoort now. I'll be looking for you.
L461797 +++$+++ u2579 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ THORWALD +++$+++ I only have a hundred dollars or so.
L461796 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
L461795 +++$+++ u2579 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ THORWALD +++$+++ I don't know what you mean.
L461794 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
L461793 +++$+++ u2579 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ THORWALD +++$+++ Why should I?
L461792 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
L461791 +++$+++ u2579 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ THORWALD +++$+++ Who are you?
L461790 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?
L461789 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Did you get my note?
L461788 +++$+++ u2579 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ THORWALD +++$+++ Hello.
L461849 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute.
L461848 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ What about the rest?
L461847 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ I got twenty or so in my purse. Give me what you've got.
L461846 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
L461845 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Ten here.
L461844 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ First offense burglary --  -- probably two-fifty.  The piggy bank.
L461843 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ How much do you think you'll need?
L461842 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ One hundred and twenty-seven.
L461840 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ To bail Lisa out of jail.
L461839 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ What do you need money for?
L461837 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Unless he's dumber than I think, he won't wait 'til his lease is up.
L461836 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
L461835 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?
L461832 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ That'll get her out of there, won't it?
L461831 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Smart? She'll be arrested!
L461830 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Smart girl.
L461829 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
L461778 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ There's no point in taking unnecessary chances.  Give me the phone book, Lisa.
L461777 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.
L461774 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Now wait a minute --
L461773 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ There's probably one in the basement.
L461772 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No.
L461771 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Got a shovel?
L461770 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ What are you two talking about?
L461757 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
L461756 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
L461755 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
L461754 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
L461753 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Would four of them -- ?
L461752 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.
L461751 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ You can tell that from here?
L461750 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
L461749 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ What?
L461748 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ I wonder.
L461744 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I have a feeling we've just begun.
L461743 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Thank heaven that's over!
L461742 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Look!
L461741 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ You shouldn't have let her do that! If he ever --
L461726 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ There's something buried there.
L461725 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ There's a dip at this end. And since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
L461724 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ And digging in.  Look at that flower bed.
L461723 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?
L461717 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it.
L461716 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Mrs. Thorwald?
L461438 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way.
L461437 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ I'm just going to get the name of their truck!
L461429 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Oh. Well, yes and no. It wasn't an official call. He's just a friend.  An old, ornery friend.
L461428 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ You called the police?
L461427 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Huh?
L461426 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Police?
L461425 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Stella, I -- I can't tell you what a welcome sight this is. No wonder your husband's still in love with you.
L461348 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L461347 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies. I'll see you tomorrow.
L461346 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
L461345 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
L461344 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Get back there! He'll see you!
L461343 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ A Federal offense.
L461339 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ In this heat?  They're up now.
L461338 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
L461337 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ What about this morning? Any developments?
L461336 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ But it takes a particularly low type of man to do it.
L461335 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
L461334 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
L461333 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.
L461332 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
L461331 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
L461330 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Isn't he a salesman?
L461329 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
L461328 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ He and his wife splitting up?
L461327 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Well, the salesman could be available soon.
L461326 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
L461325 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ And some man will lose his.
L461324 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
L461323 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
L461322 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
L461321 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
L461320 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Keep your mind off her.
L461318 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Depends one which one.
L461317 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ What'll you do if one of them catches you?
L461316 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I was.
L461315 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
L461314 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ How did you know!
L461313 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
L461165 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ She pay you much?
L461164 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her.
L461163 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ That's fine, Stella. Now would you make me a sandwich?
L461162 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ When I married Myles, we were both maladjusted misfits. We still are. And we've loved every minute of it.
L461161 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Ask for trouble and you get it. Why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years. Then he refused to marry her. Why? -- Because she only scored sixty-one on a Look Magazine marriage quiz!
L461160 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ People have different emotional levels that --
L461159 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
L461158 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ We've progressed emotionally in --
L461157 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Intelligence! Nothing has caused the human race more trouble. Modern marriage!
L461156 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
L461155 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Look, Mr. Jefferies. I'm not educated. I'm not even sophisticated. But I can tell you this -- when a man and a woman see each other, and like each other -- they should come together -- wham like two taxies on Broadway. Not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle.
L461154 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ That's the hard part.
L461153 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
L461152 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.
L461151 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.
L461150 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ You're never going to marry?
L461149 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Can you see her tramping around the world with a camera bum who never has more than a week's salary in the bank?  If only she was ordinary.
L461148 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
L461147 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties.
L461146 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Is what you want something you can discuss?
L461145 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
L461144 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ She's only perfect.
L461143 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ She's just not the girl for me.
L461142 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
L461141 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Stella!
L461140 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Her father loading up the shotgun?
L461139 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No.
L461138 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause.  What is it? You have a fight?
L461137 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ She's all right.
