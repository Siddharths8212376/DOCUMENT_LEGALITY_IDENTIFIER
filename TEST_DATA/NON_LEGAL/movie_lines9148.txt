L294457 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Boy, this is good!
L294456 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ No biggie.
L294455 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
L294454 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.
L294453 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ I'm sorry?
L294452 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ My God! The fork! The fork!
L294451 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish...
L294450 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ...
L294449 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ It looks wonderful.
L294426 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Ergo if I can teach table manners to mice, I can teach them to humans. If I can teach table manners to humans, I can save the world.
L294425 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ We are animals after all.
L294424 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
L294423 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ I'm not sure.
L294422 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
L294421 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?
L294420 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans.
L294419 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ What's the larger experiment?
L294418 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded.
L294417 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Paper or cloth?
L294416 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
L294415 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ How's it going?
L294414 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
L294413 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
L294412 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
L294411 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ You are a therapist, right?
L294410 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.
L294409 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
L294408 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.
L294407 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ That's not necessarily a bad thing.
L294406 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.
L294405 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Where?
L294404 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ I have to say that I'm not there yet.
L294403 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ You've got to respect that.
L294402 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
L294401 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, "Ewww. A slug."
L294400 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ As do I.
L294399 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
L294398 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.
L295013 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ No.
L295012 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you.
L295011 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ I have to talk. Is that okay?
L295010 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.
L295009 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ Unka unka unka unka unka.
L295008 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
L295007 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ Ounpoo. Ungh.
L295006 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Puff, put the gun down.
L294999 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur.
L294998 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ Unn.
L294997 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
L294996 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ Ugnh.
L294921 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Now, my diminutive friend, what can I do for you?
L294920 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ Interesting.
L294914 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ here, here.
L294913 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support.
L294912 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.
L294911 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ Thanks to you, Nate.
L294898 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ It would be my pleasure, doctor.  Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, I stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive masturbation to...
L294897 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage.
L294819 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ Got it.
L294818 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.
L294817 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ Oh, I will!  Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me. I don't want to disappoint you.
L294816 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.
L294815 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
L294814 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Free to come and go as you please. There's some "mad money" in the night table drawer.
L294812 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Even better.
L294811 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ Extra dessert?
L294810 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
L294809 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy!
L294797 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Tomorrow, the acid test.
L294796 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ Yahoo!
L294795 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.
L294789 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Lila?
L294788 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ I bow to your expertise in these matters.
L294787 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
L294786 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.
L294775 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.
L294774 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.
L294769 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ Okay. That's fair.
L294768 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
L294767 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ Oh boy!
L294714 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Bravo, Puff! Bravo!
L294713 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen.
L294712 +++$+++ u1411 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ WENDALL +++$+++ And how do you feel about Gabrielle?
L294711 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
L294710 +++$+++ u1411 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ WENDALL +++$+++ I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila.
L294709 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha.
L294708 +++$+++ u1411 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ WENDALL +++$+++ Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair.
L294707 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ No, why?
L294706 +++$+++ u1411 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ WENDALL +++$+++ Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
L294705 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.
L295042 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And apes don't drop lines.
L295041 +++$+++ u1408 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ OLDER WOMAN +++$+++ I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
L295040 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ Yes.
L295039 +++$+++ u1408 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ OLDER WOMAN +++$+++ Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.
L295038 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was...  And I have to go back into the woods now... forever.
L295037 +++$+++ u1408 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ OLDER WOMAN +++$+++ Yes... Derek.
L295036 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ Mother?
L295035 +++$+++ u1408 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ OLDER WOMAN +++$+++ I saw you on C-Span. I've been looking for you for thirty years. Then there you were, such a beautiful, beautiful grown man.
L295034 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ Yes?
L295033 +++$+++ u1408 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ OLDER WOMAN +++$+++ Wait!
L295489 +++$+++ u1412 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ It's open...  What'll you have?
L295488 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Huh?
L295482 +++$+++ u1412 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ Right.
L295481 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Give me a bottle of beer.
L295298 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You look different... More relaxed.
L295297 +++$+++ u1412 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ Check!
L295296 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady.
L295288 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ No.
L295287 +++$+++ u1412 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ You want a chaser?
L295286 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Give me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
L295082 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Next game, ten bucks.
L295081 +++$+++ u1412 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ About sixty, seventy bucks.
L295074 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Hey, he's right!  Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?
L295073 +++$+++ u1412 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ Thanks. Sure is a hot day for driving. Late afternoon is better. You guys have plenty of time. Make Pittsburgh in two, maybe three hours.
L295070 +++$+++ u1412 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ What do you guys sell?
L295069 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.
L295068 +++$+++ u1412 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ Comin' in or goin' out?
L295067 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Mm hmm.
L295066 +++$+++ u1412 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ Pittsburgh?
L295065 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yep.
L295064 +++$+++ u1412 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ Boys just passing through?
L295911 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Sure, sure, just the money, and the aristocratic pleasure of seeing him fall apart. You're a Roman, Bert. You have to win them all.
L295910 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ All I want's the money.
L295909 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?
L295908 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ That's the way it's done.
L295907 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
L295906 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
L295905 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
L295790 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Thank you.
L295789 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Are you ready for another?
L295777 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ You tell me.
L295776 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ How?
L295775 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ I'll make it up to you.
L295774 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Listen, Miss Ladybird, you're here on a rain check and I know it. You're hanging on by your nails. You let that glory whistle blow loud and clear for Eddie and you're a wreck on a railroad track. You're a horse that finished last. So don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird. Live and let live. While you can.
L295773 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ You bastard.
L295772 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Well, nobody has to sell.
L295771 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
L295770 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
L295769 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
L295768 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
L295767 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ For whom and for what?
L295766 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ To win.
L295765 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ You know what's good for him?
L295764 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
L295763 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Do we need words?
L295762 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ I want to talk to you.
L295761 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.
L295760 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.
L295742 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ She's a smart girl, Eddie.
L295741 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ And a fact is a fact.
L295740 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ That's right, Miss Packard.
L295739 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.
L295735 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Oh, I forgot all about it.  How's the hands?
L295734 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?
L295732 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?
L295731 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?
L295721 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Soon as I finish my coffee.
L295720 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I'm ready.
L295714 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Lots of action. Lots of money.  Lots of class. You'll see some of the best-dressed and most beautiful women in the world at the races. Knock your eye out.
L295713 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I've never been to Louisville.
L295712 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
L295711 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ No, I'm fine.
L295710 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
L295709 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Packard. Sarah Packard.
L295708 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
L295888 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Twelve thousand.
L295887 +++$+++ u1418 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FINDLEY +++$+++ How much do I owe you?
L295886 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Cash.
L295885 +++$+++ u1418 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FINDLEY +++$+++ Will you take a check, Bert?
L295861 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ The night is two thousand dollars old.
L295860 +++$+++ u1418 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FINDLEY +++$+++ That seems a shame. The night is young.
L295854 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ It's possible.
L295853 +++$+++ u1418 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FINDLEY +++$+++ Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist.
L295850 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ I didn't ask him can he beat you. I already know he can beat you. I asked him will he? With Eddie, that's two different things.
L295849 +++$+++ u1418 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FINDLEY +++$+++ Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
L295848 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Do you really think you can beat him?
L295847 +++$+++ u1418 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FINDLEY +++$+++ Oh, about five hundred.
L295846 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ How much?
L295834 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Deal the cards.
L295833 +++$+++ u1418 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FINDLEY +++$+++ I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
L295830 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ You ever played billiards before?
L295829 +++$+++ u1418 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FINDLEY +++$+++ Oh, we'll start small... a hundred dollars a game.
L295813 +++$+++ u1418 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FINDLEY +++$+++ Good, good.
L295812 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ We'll be there.
L295805 +++$+++ u1418 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FINDLEY +++$+++ Well, Mr. Felson, maybe you could come out to my place some evening. We could play a few games of billiards.
L295804 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Could be.
L295962 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ And we twisted it, didn't we, Bert? Course, maybe that doesn't stick in your throat cause you spit it out just like you spit out everything else. But it sticks in mine. I loved her, Bert. I traded her in on a pool game. But that wouldn't mean anything to you. Because who did you ever care about? Just win, win, you said, win, that's the important thing. You don't know what winnin' is, Bert. You're a loser. 'Cause you're dead inside, and you can't live unless you make everything else dead around ya.
L295961 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
L295960 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Boy, we really gave it to her good.
L295959 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Aaaahhhh!
L295958 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
L295957 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
L295956 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Fifty per cent?
L295955 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
L295954 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
L295953 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ I'm a businessman, kid.
L295952 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
L295950 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ You don't pay me? You gonna get your thumbs broken.  And your fingers. And if I want them to, your right arm in three or four places.
L295949 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
L295948 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Well, here it's half.
