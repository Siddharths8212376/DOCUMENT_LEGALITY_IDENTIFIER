L176241 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Our what?
L176240 +++$+++ u4967 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ MARCIA +++$+++ They're gonna mock our foibles.
L176239 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No! I barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever I'm regularly in contact with they want releases from.
L176434 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I can't do that to him. He's pushing a little too hard - but... I just can't do that to him.
L176433 +++$+++ u4961 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ FELICIA +++$+++ Never would be plenty.
L176432 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ How much less?
L176429 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ He's just ... trying a little too hard --
L176428 +++$+++ u4961 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ FELICIA +++$+++ It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
L176427 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What does this mean?
L176418 +++$+++ u4961 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ FELICIA +++$+++ No, I mean...
L176417 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Are you asking me?
L176325 +++$+++ u4966 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Welcome to work, Ed.
L176324 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hey, Lou.
L176177 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Who's in it?
L176176 +++$+++ u4966 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
L176175 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well, then I'm quitting.
L176174 +++$+++ u4966 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
L176173 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You batted or you bunted?
L176172 +++$+++ u4966 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ I batted!
L176171 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
L176170 +++$+++ u4966 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
L176169 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
L176168 +++$+++ u4966 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Um, yeah, I was gonna ...
L177326 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number.
L177325 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV.  Hah?
L177324 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ My lovely assistant, Shari. I'm glad you asked. The contest is who can dig up -- legally, of course -- I'm not suggesting that anyone break any laws -- the most embarrassing and humiliating facts about any of the executives here at the North American Broadcasting System which owns Real TV.
L177323 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ What do we have to do?
L177322 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in.
L177310 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It's nice.
L177309 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.
L177308 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What did you do to your hair?
L177307 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any  man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner.
L177306 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
L177305 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Kinda'.
L176940 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Come on.
L176939 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ This is going right up your ass.
L176935 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well, yeah, everybody's someone. But I mean someone they want to be. I mean let's face it, I'm working in the video store, no one's coming in saying "oh, I wish I was that guy. 1 wish was rewinding that huge pile of tapes." At least for a month I'm not just a guy with a name tag. I'm famous.
L176934 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Everybody's someone.
L176933 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You see how people look at me. Like when they ask for my autograph or say "Hi" to me... It's like I'm a basketball player or a... you know, like I'm someone.
L176932 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ What?
L176931 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
L176930 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ The what?
L176929 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.
L176928 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ No... Could you?
L176927 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!
L176926 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ No. It's your fault.
L176925 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It's not their fault.
L176919 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ ...yeah?
L176918 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
L176917 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
L176916 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "How do they find me" she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right?
L176915 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Are you all right?
L176914 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I need to talk.
L176913 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Come on...
L176912 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Okay.
L176911 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
L176910 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone.
L176907 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Somewhere.
L176906 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Where?
L176905 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Come on, let's go.
L176904 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L176903 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
L176902 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
L176901 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So?
L176900 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
L176775 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Ed?
L176774 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Really? 
L176773 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ There's a list.
L176772 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Exactly. Boy, you're smart.  Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you?  "Is she good enough for Ed?" Who the hell am I?  Who the hell do you think I should be dating?
L176771 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Twenty-nine.
L176770 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... 
L176769 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no."  They hate me!
L176768 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Ohh...
L176767 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Page three of the Post.
L176766 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Look at this.
L176765 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No. Who?
L176764 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Everybody hates me!
L176763 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Shari...
L176762 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ I have no privacy. Even now! I'm crying and I can't stop and they won't go away. And now it's going to be another month!
L176758 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
L176757 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So...?
L176756 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ ... yeah, then, but...
L176755 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
L176754 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ I really like you too...
L176753 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Shari, I really like you...
L176752 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ I know, I ...
L176751 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
L176750 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
L176749 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
L176748 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What?
L176747 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Um...
L176743 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ He could give me some oxygen.
L176742 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Why?
L176741 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I wish my stepfather was here.
L176720 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Saturday, I think we should
L176719 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ That's lucky.
L176718 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh -- Sunday is good for me to meet your folks. We get a big family audience on Sundays so it works out.
L176672 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It's quite an honor. Will you come with me?
L176671 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Oh yeah.
L176670 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
L176669 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ The what?
L176668 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
L176667 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ You should see the one we wear when it rains.
L176666 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It's really a tremendous turnoff.
L176665 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Yeah, well...
L176664 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You know, I never saw you in your uniform before.
L176663 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I missed you.
L176662 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ What are you doing?
L176545 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.
L176544 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Oh God, this is so weird.
L176543 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Really?
L176542 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
L176541 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
L176540 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Really?
L176531 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ All right. Okay. I'11 ... see you.
L176530 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Go!
L176529 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Can't we just --
L176528 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Leave. Go.
L176527 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well, when you put it that way.
L176526 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
L176525 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It's... okay
L176524 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Oh my God.
L176513 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah.
L176512 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Really?
L176506 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Look, not having been there... I just think you're hurt and you're saying this to, you know, get back at him.
L176505 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ I mean bad.
L176499 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh... how come?
L176498 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him.
L176497 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Okay ...
L176496 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Ha!
L176495 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --
L176494 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Don't defend that horse's ass to me.
L176487 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Shari, I'm just really sorry. Look, I know this is... unbelievably awkward, but if I could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say... two words, then...
L176486 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ What do you want?!
L176382 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No, no, I -- as soon as you came in tonight I said to John, "Boy Shari looks beautiful." I said it on TV so you can ask anybody who saw it.
L176381 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Right.
L176380 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You do though, you look great.
L176269 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Dynamite is dangerous.
L176268 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So maybe this is my dynamite.
L176267 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ So?
L176266 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Dynamite.
L176265 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Cream rinse?
L176264 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
L176263 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Why do it?
L176262 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.
L176261 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Are you sure about this?
L176148 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Really? You see, to me, you shouldn't have any trouble with men. There should be, like, a line behind you.
L176147 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
L176146 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I hear the dog really liked him.
L176145 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Yeah...
L177340 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.
L177339 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
L177262 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I commit. I take a chance. You wanted to be the guy on TV, but you didn't want to say you wanted to. So you have me talk you into it so you get what you want, but if it goes bad it's not your fault.
L177261 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Me?! That's you!
L177260 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
L177259 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
L177258 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You know what your problem is?
L177257 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break." 
L177256 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Come on, Ma.
L177226 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I put his -- who --  Look, Marsh, he's not that good a singer, he'll be back.
L177225 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That's right. You put Cliff on television. So then he decided he was too good for her and he left.
L177224 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Me?!
L177223 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Cliff left her, thanks to you.
L176626 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Ray, come an--
L176625 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Good-bye, brother!
L176618 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Cassie...
L176617 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What are we gonna fight? Ray, please, listen to me --
L176612 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Save it.
L176611 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Look, we gotta talk.
L176610 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I know.
L176609 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
L176608 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Yeah.
L176607 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ... Ray?
L176478 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ If I go over to Shari, the camera's going there, too.
L176477 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Please!
L176476 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You brought the girl!
L176475 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You brought the cameras here!
