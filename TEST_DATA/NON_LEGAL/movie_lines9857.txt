L245987 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Well, that's alright... alright. Good.  You'll graduate in another year, isn't that right?  You know... I never finished college.  I was a good student, but I never finished. Of course, there was a war then.
L245986 +++$+++ u5529 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I'm not hungry.
L245985 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
L245984 +++$+++ u5529 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I was taller than you when I was fourteen.
L245983 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You've grown so tall... so tall in the last year.  You're much taller than me.
L245207 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Some day you will.
L245206 +++$+++ u5529 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I can help you.
L245205 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ To do business.
L245204 +++$+++ u5529 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Why do you have to go?
L245203 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I can't.
L245202 +++$+++ u5529 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Will you take me?
L245201 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Just a few days.
L245200 +++$+++ u5529 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I know.  How long will you be gone?
L245199 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
L245198 +++$+++ u5529 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ On your pillow.
L245197 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No, where is it?
L245196 +++$+++ u5529 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Did you see my present for you?
L245195 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ They were friends.
L245194 +++$+++ u5529 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
L245193 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Do you like them?
L245192 +++$+++ u5529 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I got lots of presents.
L245191 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Did you like your party?
L245190 +++$+++ u5529 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Yes.
L245189 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Are you alright?
L245702 +++$+++ u5530 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CICCI +++$+++ At first, like everybody, I was a soldier.
L245701 +++$+++ u5555 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ What position did you occupy?
L245700 +++$+++ u5530 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CICCI +++$+++ The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
L245699 +++$+++ u5555 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
L245698 +++$+++ u5530 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CICCI +++$+++ That's right.
L245697 +++$+++ u5555 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the &quot;Genco Olive Oil Company.&quot;
L245692 +++$+++ u5531 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++ Go on, answer him when he talks to you.  Tell him: Columbus, Marconi... Garibaldi.
L245691 +++$+++ u5559 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ VITO +++$+++ Who is the greatest man you can think of?
L245176 +++$+++ u5559 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ VITO +++$+++ This man informs to the police; this man allows his vengeance to be bought off... No, he is alone.
L245175 +++$+++ u5531 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++  What?  You read it in the papers?
L245174 +++$+++ u5559 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ VITO +++$+++ Fanucci is not connected; he is alone.
L245167 +++$+++ u5559 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ VITO +++$+++ If you like, why not give me fifty dollars each to pay Fanucci.  I guarantee he will accept that amount from me.
L245166 +++$+++ u5531 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++ They say Fanucci has a license from Maranzalla himself to work this neighborhood.
L245134 +++$+++ u5531 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++ Oh yes, the very best.
L245133 +++$+++ u5559 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ VITO +++$+++ Your friend lives in a fine building.
L245131 +++$+++ u5531 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++ No.  He would give it away.  I know how to repay a consideration.
L245130 +++$+++ u5559 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ VITO +++$+++ We have no money for a rug.
L245129 +++$+++ u5531 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++ I have a friend who has a fine rug. Maybe your wife would like it.
L245173 +++$+++ u5531 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++  Then, after that, what?  Joe 'Little Knife' Pisani; Willie Bufalino, maybe, Mr. Maranzalla himself, c'mon!
L245172 +++$+++ u5558 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ TESSIO +++$+++  He's going to kill Fanucci.
L245171 +++$+++ u5531 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++ Vitone!  Our driver has drunk too much wine.
L245165 +++$+++ u5558 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ TESSIO +++$+++ What can we do?
L245164 +++$+++ u5531 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++  You know his friends...real animals. And his connections with the police. Sure he'd like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude. Then they would owe him a favor; that's how he operates.  We'll have to pay.  Three hundred, are we agreed?
L245163 +++$+++ u5558 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ TESSIO +++$+++ What if we don't pay?
L245162 +++$+++ u5531 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++ That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won't take a dime less than three hundred dollars.
L245161 +++$+++ u5558 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ TESSIO +++$+++ Do you think he'd be satisfied with the two hundred dollars?  I think he would.
L245148 +++$+++ u5531 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++ She couldn't decide.
L245147 +++$+++ u5558 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ TESSIO +++$+++ What took so long?
L245025 +++$+++ u5532 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ Merle, have you met my sister-in- law Deanna?
L245024 +++$+++ u5543 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MAMA +++$+++ Connie.
L245023 +++$+++ u5532 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true.
L244902 +++$+++ u5543 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MAMA +++$+++ You go see your children first, and then you wait to see your brother like everybody else.
L244901 +++$+++ u5532 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ This is swell.  Where's Michael? I've got things to get straight with him and I can't wait on line.
L244900 +++$+++ u5543 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MAMA +++$+++ Bought at the airport.
L244899 +++$+++ u5532 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ I got surprises for everybody!
L244898 +++$+++ u5543 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MAMA +++$+++ Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.
L244897 +++$+++ u5532 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ How are the kids?
L244896 +++$+++ u5543 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MAMA +++$+++ Yes, thank you.
L244895 +++$+++ u5532 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle?
L244894 +++$+++ u5543 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MAMA +++$+++ Constanzia.  We expected you last week; we sent the car to pick you up at the airport last week.
L245896 +++$+++ u5532 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ I hated you for so long, Michael; for so many years.  I think I did things to myself, to hurt myself, so that you would know -- and you would be hurt too.  But I understand you now; I think I do.  You were being strong for all of us, like Papa was.  And I forgive you, and want to be close to you now.  Can't you forgive Fredo; he's so sweet, and helpless without you.
L245895 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ The children can stay.
L245894 +++$+++ u5532 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ I want to talk to you, Michael.
L245893 +++$+++ u5532 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ Kids, why don't you go outside for a while?
L245892 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Tom is right.
L245891 +++$+++ u5532 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
L245890 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No.
L245889 +++$+++ u5532 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ Is Kay coming?
L244960 +++$+++ u5532 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ It was my father's money; and I'm entitled to what I need.  Where is Tom Hagen?
L244959 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.
L244958 +++$+++ u5532 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ Because I need MONEY!
L244957 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Then why do you come to me?
L244956 +++$+++ u5532 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ You're not my father!
L244955 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.
L244954 +++$+++ u5532 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ Michael...
L244953 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.
L244951 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Why do you come to me?  Why don't you go to a travel agent?
L244950 +++$+++ u5532 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.
L244949 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I saw him with you.
L244948 +++$+++ u5532 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ How are you, honey?  You've met Merle, haven't you.  He was with me in Vegas.
L245223 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Mike, what can I do, she's a hysterical woman...
L245222 +++$+++ u5533 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ DEANNA +++$+++ I don't want to stay here...
L245220 +++$+++ u5533 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ DEANNA +++$+++ I'm getting out of here I said; these guys all have guns!
L245219 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Deanna, will you get back into the house!
L245062 +++$+++ u5533 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ DEANNA +++$+++ These Eye-ties are really crazy when it comes to their wives.
L245061 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
L245060 +++$+++ u5533 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ DEANNA +++$+++ Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
L245059 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
L245058 +++$+++ u5533 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ DEANNA +++$+++ I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
L245022 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ A hundred years...it's a toast.
L245021 +++$+++ u5533 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ DEANNA +++$+++ What's 'cent' Anne?'
L244891 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ He's the head of the family.
L244890 +++$+++ u5533 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ DEANNA +++$+++ I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
L244889 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party.
L244888 +++$+++ u5533 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ DEANNA +++$+++ Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me.
L244887 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Goddamn bitch.
L244882 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Yeah, but I don't want him to see you.
L244881 +++$+++ u5533 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ DEANNA +++$+++ I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.
L244880 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Honey!  Wait a minute; let's go for a drive.
L246017 +++$+++ u5534 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ I know.  I know, Michael.  It's Christmas, your brothers and sister are all here -- we are happy. Let's not spoil this.  Go your own way, but when you are ready, come to me the way a son should.  I have hopes for you...
L246016 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ That's how it was in the old world, Pop, but this is not Sicily.
L246015 +++$+++ u5534 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ Anyone not in your family, is a stranger.  Believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you.
L246014 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Not for strangers; for my country.
L246013 +++$+++ u5534 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ You would risk your life for strangers?
L246012 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It's not talk; I'm doing it.
L246011 +++$+++ u5534 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?
L246010 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No, Dad.
L246009 +++$+++ u5534 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ Would you like some?
L244841 +++$+++ u5535 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ DON FRANCESCO +++$+++ He will be a man, and then he will come for revenge.
L244840 +++$+++ u5560 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ WIDOW +++$+++ The child cannot harm you.
L244839 +++$+++ u5535 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ DON FRANCESCO +++$+++ He will grow strong.
L244838 +++$+++ u5560 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ WIDOW +++$+++ He is weak.
L244837 +++$+++ u5535 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ DON FRANCESCO +++$+++ I'm not afraid of his words.
L244836 +++$+++ u5560 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ WIDOW +++$+++ Don Francesco.  You murdered my husband, because he would not bend. And his oldest son Paolo, because he swore revenge.  But Vitone is only nine, and dumb-witted.  He never speaks.
L245184 +++$+++ u5536 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FANUCCI +++$+++ Ah, you're a sharp young fellow. How is it I've never noticed you before  You're too quiet for your own interest.  I could find some work for you to do that would be very profitable.  No hard feelings, eh?  If I can ever do you a service let me know. You've done a good job for yourself tonight.
L245183 +++$+++ u5559 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ VITO +++$+++ I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
L245182 +++$+++ u5536 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FANUCCI +++$+++ I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.
L245159 +++$+++ u5536 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FANUCCI +++$+++  You're a good fellow.
L245158 +++$+++ u5559 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ VITO +++$+++ But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
L245157 +++$+++ u5536 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FANUCCI +++$+++ I understand...
L245156 +++$+++ u5559 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ VITO +++$+++  You must understand, this is all new to me...
L245155 +++$+++ u5536 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FANUCCI +++$+++ You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.
L245154 +++$+++ u5559 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ VITO +++$+++  My two friends have my share of the money.  I'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.
L245153 +++$+++ u5536 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FANUCCI +++$+++ Otherwise the police will come to see you and your wife and children will be dishonored and destitute. Of course, if my information as to your gains is incorrect, I'll dip my beak just a little.  Just a little, but no less than one hundred dollars, and don't try to deceive me, eh paisan?
L245823 +++$+++ u5548 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ PENTANGELI +++$+++ Let's go.
L245822 +++$+++ u5537 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FBI MAN #1 +++$+++ Ready, Frankie.
L245798 +++$+++ u5548 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ PENTANGELI +++$+++ I didn't turn against nobody; he turned against me.
L245797 +++$+++ u5537 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FBI MAN #1 +++$+++ Why'd you do it, Frankie?  After all these years, why'd you turn against him?
L245794 +++$+++ u5548 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ PENTANGELI +++$+++ Yeah, some deal I made.
L245793 +++$+++ u5537 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FBI MAN #1 +++$+++ We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
L245792 +++$+++ u5548 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ PENTANGELI +++$+++ My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
L245791 +++$+++ u5537 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FBI MAN #1 +++$+++ Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
L245790 +++$+++ u5548 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ PENTANGELI +++$+++ Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose.
L244913 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ C'mon, I see what I can do.
L244912 +++$+++ u5548 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ PENTANGELI +++$+++ That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about.  What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?
L244911 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ We were all upset about that.
L244910 +++$+++ u5548 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ PENTANGELI +++$+++ You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh...
L244909 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you. Reminds me of old times.
L244908 +++$+++ u5548 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ PENTANGELI +++$+++ Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey, what's with the food?  Some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver. 'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker with chopped liver.' Go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or I'll send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners!
L244907 +++$+++ u5538 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ FREDO +++$+++ Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie &quot;Five-Angels&quot;...thought you were never coming West.
