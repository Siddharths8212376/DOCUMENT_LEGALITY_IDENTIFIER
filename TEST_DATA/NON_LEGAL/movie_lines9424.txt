L551142 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
L551141 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.
L550690 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ What else you got?
L550689 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
L550688 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
L550687 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
L550686 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'.
L550685 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Now that is cold, Lenny.  I always bring you choice.
L550684 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
L550683 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
L550682 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I got to get this rig fixed.  Look at it...
L550681 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ So lay it off to somebody else.
L550680 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
L550679 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
L550678 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
L550677 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.
L550676 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?
L550675 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
L550674 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
L550673 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
L550672 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Sorry.
L550671 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
L550670 +++$+++ u3061 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TICK +++$+++ Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
L551055 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ I do mean it.  And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand?
L551054 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ It's alright.  He means it.
L551053 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?
L551052 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Charm.
L550928 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
L550927 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ About what?
L550924 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Faith, can I talk to you a second?
L550923 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ I always do.
L550922 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
L550921 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.
L550918 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ I already got everything I need from you.
L550917 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
L550916 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
L550873 +++$+++ u3060 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ STRICKLAND +++$+++ Your existence.
L550872 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Your sex life?
L550871 +++$+++ u3060 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ STRICKLAND +++$+++ I don't like disappointments, Nero. And do you know what disappoints me very much?
L550870 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.
L550869 +++$+++ u3060 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ STRICKLAND +++$+++ Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
L550868 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
L550867 +++$+++ u3060 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ STRICKLAND +++$+++ Commissioner Strickland.
L550866 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Strickland.
L550865 +++$+++ u3060 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ STRICKLAND +++$+++ Nero.
L551451 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Yeah.  See you there.
L551450 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ See you downtown.
L551449 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
L551448 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Yeah.  We did.
L551447 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Hey, Lenny.  We made it.
L551443 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
L551442 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Are we under arrest?
L551363 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Yeah, right.  Fucked.
L551362 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Then we'll be right where we are now.
L551361 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?
L551360 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ No.  Trust me.
L551359 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
L551358 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Take it to him.
L551354 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.
L551353 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ That's the original.  There are no copies.
L551352 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I still got one ace to play.  Tran's got what I want... and I've got what he wants...
L551351 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
L551350 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Alright.  We're going up.
L551348 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Uh unh.
L551347 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ You see Tran?
L551346 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
L551345 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Got your ticket?
L551344 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.
L551343 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Mace... you're a girl.
L551340 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ No, it's not.
L551339 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
L551338 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ You never told me.
L551337 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
L551336 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ No.  It didn't.
L551335 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
L551334 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ I guess.
L551333 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
L551332 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.
L551325 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
L551324 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
L551323 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ I'm not going.
L551322 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--
L551294 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.
L551293 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
L551271 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
L551270 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Who's Strickland?
L551266 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Yeah, right, blow it open.
L551265 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
L551254 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ How long does it last?  Oh.
L551253 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ He's totally cut off from the outer world.
L551246 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ To break the trail.  If those cops had gotten hold of her, they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for, and then gone after them too.  Our killer is running as scared as we are.  Which makes him really dangerous.  Judging by how scared I am.
L551245 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Why?
L551244 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
L551243 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
L551242 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ It was a tough call.
L551241 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
L551240 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ There's a plus side?
L551239 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Well, look at the plus side.
L551238 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny.
L551232 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Maybe.  But tonight is probably not the best night.  Come on, we're rollin'.
L551231 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
L551230 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I've got a good idea, yeah.
L551229 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
L551228 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
L551226 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Yeah I know.  So what do we do?
L551225 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
L551224 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Hang on.  Hang on, Max.  You see?
L551203 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important.
L551202 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Uh unh.  I won't do it.
L551201 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
L551200 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Tell me.
L551192 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ It's the walk.  Something.  Anyway, they'll run your plates and get your address.  We gotta keep moving.
L551191 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ You sure?
L551190 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Those two guys were cops.
L551186 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.
L551185 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
L551180 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Fire's out, isn't it?
L551179 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Are you out of your fucking mind?!
L551178 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ The gas tank's going to go any second!
L551177 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ This is bad.
L551176 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.
L551175 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
L551174 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
L551173 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
L551172 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
L551171 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Shit!
L551166 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
L551165 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Lenny, give them the tape.
L551158 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Something in your car...
L551157 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
L551156 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
L551135 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  "A Love Supreme." Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.
L551134 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Lenny, have you lost it completely?
L551131 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
L551130 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ You better keep a low profile for a while.
L551129 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
L551128 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Will you relax.  There's nobody back there.
L551126 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ This tie doesn't go with blue!
L551125 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ What is it?
L551123 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Anywhere.  We'll talk about it in the car.
L551122 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Where we going?
L551121 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Jesus, Mace!
L551120 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Whatup Lenny?
L551103 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ S'okay.  I know you still love me.
L551102 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.
L551101 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
L551100 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ How's Zander?
L551099 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Sure.
L551098 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough.  You want to rub my neck?
L551097 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Now you're really getting paranoid.
L551096 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ And what about the guy that was following me?
L551095 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ That's where it gets a little strange.
L551094 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
L551093 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
L551092 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
L551091 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ So the guy's not a sicko.
L551090 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ She said "If they get me".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.
L551089 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
L551088 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ No it doesn't.
L551087 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ But that doesn't add, does it.
L551086 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ See, it's all about what they see walking in.  A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong.  Random kill.  The kind you never solve.
L551083 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ It's not your fault.
L551082 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.
L551081 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
L551080 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ No more, Lenny.
L551079 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I need to see more... get more detail.  Something.  I feel his presence, so strong...
L551078 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.
L551077 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ It gives me... I don't know... maybe two hundred people who I know wear.
L551076 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ So that gives you something.
L551075 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot.
L551073 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Never really thought about it.
L551072 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
L551071 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Is this great fabric or what?
L551039 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
L551038 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
L551035 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.
L551034 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Jesus, Mace.  Back off.
L551031 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
L551030 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
L551027 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Wants to share.
L551026 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ And gives it to you.
L551008 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Are you sure it's real?
L551007 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
L551006 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Blackjack?  I don't understand--
L551005 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Black.  Jack.
L551004 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ My God, Lenny.  What is it?
L551000 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
L550999 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ What is it?
L550995 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ No idea.
L550994 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ What's that?  Present from Faith?
L550993 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
L550992 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
L550991 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
L550990 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
L550915 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ You'll see.
L550914 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
L550913 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ She's my destiny.
L550912 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
L550911 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ She still loves me.
L550910 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Forget her.
