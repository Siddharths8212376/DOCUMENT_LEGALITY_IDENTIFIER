L148769 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ I didn't.
L148768 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
L148767 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
L148766 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You choose.
L148765 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ Which side do you like?
L148764 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ You don't like cheats, do you.
L148763 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
L148762 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ What happened?
L148723 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'll watch.
L148722 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ He doesn't gamble.
L148703 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ That's fine.
L148702 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room.
L148701 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Turn left ahead.
L148700 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ Just an accident. Nothing.
L148699 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ How did you hurt your hand?
L148561 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't gamble.
L148560 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ Toss you for it.
L148559 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Absolutely not.
L148558 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
L148556 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology.
L148555 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ Do you believe in astrology?
L148554 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ We all came from Africa, supposedly.
L148553 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
L148552 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
L148551 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
L148550 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ The debts.
L148549 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
L148548 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Your father?
L148547 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
L148546 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ In the casino.
L148545 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ Near the casino.
L148544 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
L148543 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
L148542 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ First visit to London?
L148541 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
L148540 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ So why did you come to my casino?
L148539 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
L148538 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ There's a casino in this hotel.
L148537 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ To coincidence.
L148535 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Impossible to calculate.
L148534 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
L148533 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
L148532 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
L148531 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Oh hello.
L148473 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ Well, thank you anyway.
L148472 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I've lived there.
L148471 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ You know where I'm from?
L148470 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa.
L148952 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I know a cheat when I see one. The man was a cheat.
L148951 +++$+++ u736 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ You did?
L148950 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Of course I recognised him!
L148943 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Who did it? Tell me!
L148942 +++$+++ u736 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Ross.
L148941 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Who...
L148940 +++$+++ u736 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Detective Inspector Ross.
L148973 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Turn left at the lights.
L148972 +++$+++ u731 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Where to?
L148971 +++$+++ u731 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Too much. Eighteen hundred.
L148970 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
L148969 +++$+++ u731 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ I might.
L148968 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Are you going to put a spell on me?
L148967 +++$+++ u731 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
L148966 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ And what do you do, Lucy?
L148965 +++$+++ u731 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ I'm Lucy.
L148964 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Have I?
L148963 +++$+++ u731 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ You've been avoiding me.
L148961 +++$+++ u734 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Cheers. Happy New Year. I really like you, Jacko, you're so fucking straight.  Hey, you haven't changed your clothes!
L148960 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'd like to buy you a drink.
L148959 +++$+++ u734 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me. I'd like to beat the shit out of her.
L148624 +++$+++ u734 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ I'll tell you later.
L148623 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What happened to Bella?
L148621 +++$+++ u734 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Rough life, Jack.
L148620 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Rough day?
L148574 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Don't worry.
L148573 +++$+++ u734 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ I can't give you a lift back tonight.
L148510 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ "The world breaks everyone, and afterwards many are strong in the broken places." Ernest Hemingway.
L148509 +++$+++ u734 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
L148508 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm off. I need to sleep.
L148503 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't gamble.
L148502 +++$+++ u734 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Don't worry, I won't report you!
L148501 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No thanks.
L148500 +++$+++ u734 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Hey Jack, join us.
L148499 +++$+++ u734 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ That bitch? No.
L148498 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Does Bella come here?
L148497 +++$+++ u734 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Good call. Help yourself.
L148496 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
L148495 +++$+++ u734 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Just girls. What are you drinking?
L148494 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ And the girls?
L148493 +++$+++ u734 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
L148492 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Who are these guys?
L148487 +++$+++ u734 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ I don't know what that means. I'm talking about not rocking the boat.
L148486 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You're talking about complicity.
L148485 +++$+++ u734 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.
L148484 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.
L148483 +++$+++ u734 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
L148482 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
L148481 +++$+++ u734 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ What are you, a cop?
L148480 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm not going to report it.
L148479 +++$+++ u734 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
L148478 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
L148477 +++$+++ u734 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ What the fuck are you talking about?
L148476 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.
L148440 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Some other time.
L148439 +++$+++ u734 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.
L148438 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.
L148437 +++$+++ u734 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ I'm off to a little watering hole. Why don't you join me? Relax.
L148436 +++$+++ u734 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Not bad. I have other interests, of course.
L148435 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You've done pretty well.
L148434 +++$+++ u734 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
L148433 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ How long have you worked at the casino?
L148432 +++$+++ u734 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ She's my baby.
L148431 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Nice car.
L148430 +++$+++ u734 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.
L148429 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Thanks.
L148428 +++$+++ u734 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.
L148427 +++$+++ u734 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Have you got transport?
L148426 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Over the river.
L148425 +++$+++ u734 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Where do you live, Jack?
L148583 +++$+++ u732 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ It was you, you shit.
L148582 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
L148581 +++$+++ u732 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
L148460 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm afraid that's not so, sir.
L148459 +++$+++ u732 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ I put them on together.
L148458 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.
L148457 +++$+++ u732 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
L148456 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.
L148926 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Take your time. Two weeks. Three if you need it. We'll pay you sick leave. I don't want to lose you. You're a good man. Here...
L148925 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Bruised.
L148924 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ How do you feel, Jack?
L148685 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ She was a real asset. But what could I do?
L148684 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
L148683 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Thanks for the information.
L148680 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ I can see.
L148679 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ He's paying out in stacks of 25.
L148423 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ He's a good customer.
L148422 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Does he win?
L148421 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella.
L148414 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ All right, Mr Reynolds.
L148413 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Why don't you take a break, Jack.
L148320 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
L148319 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I just want the job.
L148316 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Fine.
L148315 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ That hair will have to go.
L148314 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Fine.
L148313 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ You can start Monday week.
L148311 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ We have tapes in here that go back six months. Let me show you something.
L148310 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Very impressive.
L148309 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.
L148308 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No.
L148307 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ She's not in the gaming business is she?
L148306 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yes.
L148305 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Girlfriend?
L148304 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ First offence: verbal warning. Second offence: written warning. That one's filed and sometimes copied to the Gaming Board. My discretion. Third offence: you're sacked on the spot. You'd never work in a casino in this country again.  There's another rule: you're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino. If you see someone who's gambled here, even if it's just casually on the street, you must ignore him. Or her. You're not married, are you?
L148303 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ How?
L148302 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
L148301 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
L148300 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
L148299 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
L148298 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.
L148297 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.
L148296 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Ever?
L148295 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't gamble.
L148294 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.
L148293 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What for?
L148292 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture.
L148290 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ I said good call.
L148289 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You want me to check?
L148288 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Good call.
L148287 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.
L148286 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ What makes you so sure?
L148285 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Five.
L148284 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ I make it six.
L148283 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Five.
L148282 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ How many aces are left?
L148280 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ You won't. Not without permission.
L148279 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What happens if I want to sneeze?
L148278 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched.
L148277 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Wipe your hands.
L148276 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't think so.
L148275 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Haven't you forgotten something?
L148270 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ They've been tested.
L148269 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Where's the magnet?
L148268 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ We do. 
L148267 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You use two alternating, don't you?
L148263 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Give me 365.
L148262 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ 25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
L148261 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Any exceptions?
L148260 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
L148259 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
L148258 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Why four? And not three or five?
L148257 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ We check every four days.
L148256 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond.
L148254 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ We tried. But there wasn't enough business. The punters like company.
L148253 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Do you have a Salon Prive?
L148252 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ There are three types of casino in the U.K. High volume. Small faction. And MOTR. That's middle of the road. Us.
L148251 +++$+++ u735 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ I don't think I know that one. Private, I suppose.
L148250 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I was at Beadles.
