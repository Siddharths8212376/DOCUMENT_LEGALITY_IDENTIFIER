L101289 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
L101288 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
L101287 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Did you do it?
L101176 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ Bullshit!  Bullshit!!  You're selling it back!  That's an order!
L101175 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
L101174 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
L101173 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it.
L101172 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ Listen to me, boy.  I didn't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in!
L101169 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
L101168 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ What are we doing down here?
L101167 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ A little business move I made.  On my own.  I think you're gonna approve.
L101166 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ Where are we going?  You know I hate surprises.
L101018 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ Can't be done.  That place already died and gone to hell.
L101017 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better.
L101221 +++$+++ u4198 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ LUPOVICH +++$+++ You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your choice.
L101220 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ No way man...
L101010 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ That's it.  Get out.  Now!
L101009 +++$+++ u4198 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ LUPOVICH +++$+++ Nice rack.  How old is --
L101008 +++$+++ u4198 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ LUPOVICH +++$+++ You better hope not.  Cause it's like they say, four can keep a secret, if three are dead.
L101007 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
L101006 +++$+++ u4198 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ LUPOVICH +++$+++ That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
L101005 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.
L100998 +++$+++ u4198 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ LUPOVICH +++$+++ Well, somebody bought it.  That's what I heard.
L100997 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ I didn't sell it.
L100996 +++$+++ u4198 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ LUPOVICH +++$+++ Don't shit a shitter.  Our building. What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We had an agreement.  You were supposed to sit on it.  Not sell it --
L100995 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ What building?
L100994 +++$+++ u4198 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ LUPOVICH +++$+++ Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why I came to see you.  You sold the building.
L100993 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ Or you didn't know what to do with it.
L100992 +++$+++ u4198 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ LUPOVICH +++$+++ No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
L100991 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
L100990 +++$+++ u4198 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ LUPOVICH +++$+++ I been watching you.  You done good. Invested wisely.  Respectable businessman now.  Just like you always wanted.
L100989 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
L100988 +++$+++ u4198 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ LUPOVICH +++$+++ You certainly traded up.  ...the trophy wife.  Nice lookin'.
L100987 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ Don't call me that.
L100986 +++$+++ u4198 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ LUPOVICH +++$+++ Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
L100985 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ What the hell do you want?
L101219 +++$+++ u4198 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ LUPOVICH +++$+++ Now you.
L101218 +++$+++ u4199 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MACK +++$+++ What it is?  What it will be, muthafucka.
L100977 +++$+++ u4198 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ LUPOVICH +++$+++ Last thing you need's for me to start doing my fucking job.
L100976 +++$+++ u4199 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MACK +++$+++ You was just doing your job.
L100975 +++$+++ u4198 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ LUPOVICH +++$+++ Fair enough for the shit.  But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.
L100973 +++$+++ u4198 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ LUPOVICH +++$+++ No time for eightball.  I got your tip.
L100972 +++$+++ u4199 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MACK +++$+++ I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
L100971 +++$+++ u4198 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ LUPOVICH +++$+++ Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
L101351 +++$+++ u4203 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Fuckin' comedian.  See you tomorrow.
L101350 +++$+++ u4198 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ LUPOVICH +++$+++ Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
L101349 +++$+++ u4203 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ I'm on my way home.  Can you handle it yourself?
L101348 +++$+++ u4198 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ LUPOVICH +++$+++ 12-year olds.  They scare easy.  Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash.  Come with me.
L101347 +++$+++ u4203 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Shit, that was fast.
L101346 +++$+++ u4198 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ LUPOVICH +++$+++ I know it.  The old slaughterhouse.  Hey, Sal.  That little weasel we popped today?  He's got something for us.  I knew he would once he thought about it.
L100938 +++$+++ u4199 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MACK +++$+++ No more thoughts from your asses.  Or I will burn your asses and snort the ashes. Hear me?
L100937 +++$+++ u4205 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ STANK +++$+++ We just thought...
L100932 +++$+++ u4199 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MACK +++$+++ How many times I told you, no psycho shit.  There gonna be psycho shit, I'm the one that does it.
L100931 +++$+++ u4205 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ STANK +++$+++ But --
L100930 +++$+++ u4199 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MACK +++$+++ That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!
L100929 +++$+++ u4205 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ STANK +++$+++ We got a gift for you, Eddie.  Fresh new BMW.
L100928 +++$+++ u4199 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MACK +++$+++ Goddamnit!  How many times I told you --
L101319 +++$+++ u4199 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MACK +++$+++ Maybe I oughta open a couple holes in that head and let all them voices out. You'll feel better, I promise.
L101318 +++$+++ u4207 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ WEAZE +++$+++ It was just like in my head.
L101317 +++$+++ u4199 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MACK +++$+++ Then how'd you hear it, fool?
L101316 +++$+++ u4207 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ WEAZE +++$+++ No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
L101315 +++$+++ u4199 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MACK +++$+++ You boys been hitting the pipe?
L100936 +++$+++ u4199 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MACK +++$+++ Get that car the hell away from here, now!  I spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool.  But this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off.
L100935 +++$+++ u4207 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ WEAZE +++$+++ That's all we did, steal their ride.
L100934 +++$+++ u4199 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MACK +++$+++ You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
L100933 +++$+++ u4207 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ WEAZE +++$+++ We didn't do nothing, Eddie.
L101092 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Maybe there's a pipe underneath the floor.  It leaked and stained.
L101091 +++$+++ u4200 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ "Like a heartbeat/Like a love beat." Listen to the Di Franco twins there. Just the plumbing or something, fool.
L101069 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Post-toasted's more like it.
L101068 +++$+++ u4200 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ I am the future.  I am all colors.  All races.  All creeds.  I am the melting pot.  I am the tossed salad.  I am post racial.
L101067 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Maurice, even if it was true, what are you worried about?  Last time I checked, you weren't black.  I'm not sure what the hell you are.  But I know you aren't a black man.
L101064 +++$+++ u4200 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Just what army do you think the Colonel was in?  Everybody knows the whole chicken distribution network is owned by the Klan.  "Special recipe".  I'm telling you.  There's something in the batter. Say it makes a black man sterile.
L101063 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Why not?  He eats everything else.
L101062 +++$+++ u4200 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
L101061 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I thought you were bringing the Colonel?
L100887 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Look, you guys want to play college radio, high school reunions, and some fool's club once a week for the rest of your lives, that's cool.  But I think we can do better.
L100886 +++$+++ u4200 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Yeah right, and which ever of us is still alive at the end of the week inherits all Vincent Price's cash.
L100865 +++$+++ u4200 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Potential toxic dump site.
L100864 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
L100863 +++$+++ u4200 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ "This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
L100862 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ You gotta use your imagination.
L100857 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I was born near here.  My dad's from here.  He never mentioned it.
L100856 +++$+++ u4200 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."
L100855 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Not that I remember.
L100854 +++$+++ u4200 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ You haven't?
L100853 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Yeah, you heard of him?
L100852 +++$+++ u4200 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Jimmy Bones?
L100848 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Whattaya think?  Can you picture it? Over there the bar, and in here -- the dance floor.
L100847 +++$+++ u4200 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ And damp, too.  Let's not forget damp.
L100834 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I was planning on waiting until I got the place cleaned out, but -- like the man says, carpe diem.
L100833 +++$+++ u4200 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Sqweeep.  We innerup this programme to bring you this special news bulletin --  "Aliens from Reticula 3 have hijacked Patrick Peet and injected moly headcheese into his skull filling his entire brain cavity with cosmic slop..."
L100832 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I just accelerated my top secret long term plan for our world domination.
L100915 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ Should I?
L100914 +++$+++ u4200 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
L100913 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ That building?
L100912 +++$+++ u4200 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Not really to live, just to play.
L100909 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ No thanks.
L100908 +++$+++ u4200 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?
L100907 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ I'm not joking boy.  Don't feed it. It'll only make it hungrier.
L100906 +++$+++ u4200 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ And some people need their medication tweaked.
L101419 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ Then your father's a dead man and Jimmy Bones is gonna be around a long time.
L101418 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ It's not safe down there.  The fire started down there.  The whole thing could collapse.
L101401 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ The blood is still there.  We just gotta figure out where.
L101400 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ But the place burned to the ground.
L101399 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ ... see there ain't just two parts to a person.  There's three.  Body-Soul and Spirit.  The spirit lives in the blood. It's the wanting that holds body and soul together, and sometimes, the wanting lives on.  Jimmy's blood must still be in the house.
L101378 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Save him?  What are you talking about?
L101377 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ You sure we oughta save him?  Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling?
L100923 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ You're pretty black to be growing up in Rossmore Park.
L100922 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
L100921 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ You look mighty familiar to me.  You sure you're not from around here?
L101120 +++$+++ u4206 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ TIA +++$+++ What we have to do is call the police.
L101119 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you.
L101117 +++$+++ u4206 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ TIA +++$+++ Somehow I don't think he stabbed himself in the chest, then buried himself too.
L101116 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Evidence of what?
L101115 +++$+++ u4206 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ TIA +++$+++ Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.
L101060 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ We're all tired.  Everybody makes mistakes.  Tomorrow in the daylight, everything's gonna look different.
L101059 +++$+++ u4206 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ TIA +++$+++ There wasn't any draft.  That window was closed.
L100836 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Ours!
L100835 +++$+++ u4206 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ TIA +++$+++ Illibent?  Who's club is that?
L100829 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Moe's terms.
L100828 +++$+++ u4206 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ TIA +++$+++ How could that be?  The box was packed!
L100827 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each.
L106979 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Where is it?
L106978 +++$+++ u4212 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ JOHNNIE +++$+++ You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
L106977 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ The next one blows off your dick.
L106970 +++$+++ u4212 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ JOHNNIE +++$+++ Caesar, I don't know what you're thinking here, but if you don't put down that gun --
L106969 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ The money!
L106968 +++$+++ u4212 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ JOHNNIE +++$+++ Where's what?
L106967 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Where is it?
L106966 +++$+++ u4212 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ JOHNNIE +++$+++ I think you're fucking crazy!
L106965 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ You don't think I'll do it, do you?
L106957 +++$+++ u4212 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ JOHNNIE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L106956 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ The same way you did before.
L106955 +++$+++ u4212 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ JOHNNIE +++$+++ How the fuck can I open it?
L106954 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ You don't need a key.
L106953 +++$+++ u4212 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ JOHNNIE +++$+++ All right!  Where's the key?
L106952 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Open the case!
L106951 +++$+++ u4212 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ JOHNNIE +++$+++ Know what?
L106950 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ That's right, I know.  I fucking know.
L106945 +++$+++ u4212 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ JOHNNIE +++$+++ That you overreacted.  That you lost it.  Not me.  It was your mistake.
L106944 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Admit what?
L106943 +++$+++ u4212 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ JOHNNIE +++$+++ Just admit it, Caesar.
L106942 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Where is this going, Johnnie?
L106939 +++$+++ u4212 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ JOHNNIE +++$+++ The money I bet it was nothing to get it clean, after you made such a fucking big deal ...
L106938 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ What's that, Johnnie?
L106937 +++$+++ u4212 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ JOHNNIE +++$+++ Come on, Pop, all I want to know is one thing.  Just one thing after he made such a big deal out of it.  I bet it wasn't a big deal.  Was it, Caesar?
L106934 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Two point one seventy-six.
L106933 +++$+++ u4212 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ JOHNNIE +++$+++ So Caesar, what did it total out at?
L106915 +++$+++ u4212 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ JOHNNIE +++$+++ I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
L106914 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Glenlivet, right, Gino?
L106911 +++$+++ u4212 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ JOHNNIE +++$+++ No, no, Caesar.  Not now.
L106910 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ You want to get into this now?
L106909 +++$+++ u4212 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ JOHNNIE +++$+++ You shouldn't have hit me.
L106628 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Here, put this in his mouth.
L106627 +++$+++ u4212 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ JOHNNIE +++$+++ You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
L106626 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Whoa, whoa.  Come on, he's making too much noise.
L106990 +++$+++ u4211 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ GINO +++$+++ Give it to me.
L106989 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ I can't.  I can't.
L106988 +++$+++ u4211 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ GINO +++$+++ Gimme the gun.
L106987 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ No!
L106986 +++$+++ u4211 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ GINO +++$+++ We're family, Caesar.
L106985 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Stay away!
L106984 +++$+++ u4211 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ GINO +++$+++ No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
L106983 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Sit down, Gino!
L106982 +++$+++ u4211 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ GINO +++$+++ You aim a gun at me?!  Do you know who I am?!  I am Gino Marzzone.  You understand?
L106981 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ No, Gino!
L106973 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Gino, your son stole this money to set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!
L106972 +++$+++ u4211 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ GINO +++$+++ Caesar!
L106963 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
L106962 +++$+++ u4211 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ GINO +++$+++ Caesar?  What is this?
L106927 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Yeah, I know.
L106926 +++$+++ u4211 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ GINO +++$+++ We know how this was done, eh?
L107280 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Caesar, you don't know shit.
L107279 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ What are you going to do, V?  Shoot me?  Kill me in cold blood?  I don't think so.  I'll tell you why.  If you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago.  If I was you, I would have killed me the minute I brought the money home.  But you didn't and I know why, because you don't want to kill me.  Do you, V?  Do you? No, I know you don't.
L107278 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Caesar, don't.
L107257 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I knew I couldn't trust you.
L107256 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ You know he would have done you, too.
L107255 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I should have let him kill you.
L107254 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Now that's teamwork.
L107235 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Sure, Gino, sure.
L107234 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
L107233 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Yes, I understand.
L107232 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.
L107231 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ I'm listening.
L107230 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey.
L107227 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Now you listen to me, asshole, I know your gun is behind the bar ...
L107226 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit.
L107225 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ But everybody is all right.
L107224 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ They were in a car accident.
L107223 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ We were in a car accident --
L107220 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Good boy.
L107219 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Holy shit, I don't believe it!  We've been going crazy over here, Gino!
L107218 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ You're blowing your only chance. Act like I'm Gino.
L107217 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ What?
L107155 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Shut up!
L107154 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
L107153 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ I had to.  You made me.
L107152 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ You murdered Gino!
L107151 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ You betrayed me!
L107150 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Saved me?  You don't even know me. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you.  All part of the business.
