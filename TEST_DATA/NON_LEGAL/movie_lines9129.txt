L279265 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
L279264 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ That's what I said.
L279263 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
L279262 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."
L279154 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Bullshit.
L279153 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
L279152 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
L279151 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Nothing.
L279150 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ What?
L279149 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Oh well.  Nevermind.
L279148 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ No.  The Righteous Brothers.
L279147 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
L279130 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ It's the new --
L279129 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Holy Shiite!  What the fuck's this?
L279989 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all.
L279988 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L279987 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an appointment?
L279986 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Where's Rob?
L279985 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Oh, hi.
L279984 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Hey, Barry.
L279844 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.
L279843 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ "Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz. "Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling.
L280091 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Haha.  Right.  It's no problem.  I love making tapes.
L280090 +++$+++ u1314 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
L280089 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
L280088 +++$+++ u1314 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
L280087 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
L280086 +++$+++ u1314 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"
L280085 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Look, I'm sorry about this, but I'd like "the Upsetter" by Lee "Scratch" Perry, in there.  Instead of "Sin City."
L280084 +++$+++ u1314 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ "Music for Old People." What does that mean?
L280083 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
L280082 +++$+++ u1314 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ What's his name?
L280081 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yeah.
L280080 +++$+++ u1314 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Nice friend.
L280079 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
L280078 +++$+++ u1314 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
L280077 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Sure, but is that it for the list?
L280076 +++$+++ u1314 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
L280075 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Is that it?
L280074 +++$+++ u1314 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Fine.  That's great.
L280073 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... "Sin City." "New Rose," by The Damned. "Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic. "Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello, Japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... "Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley... And... "Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and the Family Stone.  A bit controversial, I know, but...
L280072 +++$+++ u1314 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter.  I'll do one.  My five favorite from the old days at the Dodger.
L280071 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
L280070 +++$+++ u1314 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
L280069 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ What do you mean, four more?
L280068 +++$+++ u1314 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
L280067 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
L280066 +++$+++ u1314 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Is there a difference?
L280065 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
L280064 +++$+++ u1314 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Your desert island top-five.
L280063 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Pardon me?
L280062 +++$+++ u1314 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records?
L280061 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yeah.  I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
L280060 +++$+++ u1314 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Right.  So.  You must have an enormous record collection.
L280059 +++$+++ u1314 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ So.  Is now a good time?
L280058 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ What I mean is, I didn't mean you look young.  You don't.  You don't look old either.  You look just as old as you are.  A bit younger maybe, but not a lot.  Not much.  Just right.
L280057 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Huh.  You used to come to the club? I shouldn't have let you in.  You must have only been about sixteen.
L280056 +++$+++ u1314 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
L280055 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Oh.  Okay.
L280054 +++$+++ u1314 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
L280053 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Right.  Why?
L280052 +++$+++ u1314 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
L280051 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Uh.  That's me.
L280050 +++$+++ u1314 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
L280049 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ May I help you?
L279746 +++$+++ u1315 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Oh God, no.  I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
L279745 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
L279744 +++$+++ u1315 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It's all kind of lost in the... in the dense mists of time now... It wasn't that I really liked Marco more.  In fact I thought you were more, shall we say, attractive than him.  It was just that he knew he was good-looking and you didn't, and that made a difference somehow.  You used to act as if I was weird for wanting to spend time with you, and that got kind of beat, if you know what I mean.  Your self-image started to rub off on me and I ended up thinking that I was strange.  And I knew that you were kind and thoughtful... you made me laugh, and I dug the way you got consumed by things you loved... and Marco seemed a bit more, I don't know, glamorous? More sure of himself?  Less hard work, because I felt like I was dragging you around, sort of.  A little sunnier.  Sparkier.  I don't know.  You know what people are like at that age.  They make very superficial judgements.  Do you think that's superficial?  He was a clown, if it's any consolation.
L279743 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ C'mon, just answer the question. You can say what you like.  What the hell?
L279742 +++$+++ u1315 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?
L279741 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Huh?
L279740 +++$+++ u1315 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
L279739 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Why did you break up with me for Marco?
L279738 +++$+++ u1315 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hey Rob.
L279737 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Hey Charlie.
L279736 +++$+++ u1315 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.
L279735 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Uh...yes, at the moment.
L279734 +++$+++ u1315 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
L279733 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
L279732 +++$+++ u1315 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Good.  Great.  Yeah... Wow.  Rob Gordon.  Seems like a 100 million years ago now.
L279731 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yeah, sure...
L279730 +++$+++ u1315 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call. In LA on business.  You know how it gets.
L279961 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Who's that?
L279960 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ It's Vince and Justin.
L279959 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ What is this.
L279842 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ "Abraham, Martin, and John." That's a nice one.
L279841 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Can I do anything?
L279822 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it.
L279821 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
L279619 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
L279618 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole.
L279422 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yeah but more than that.  I'm happy because I'm proud of us.  Because although our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage.
L279421 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Well we rang $900 today.
L279390 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Do it.  Do it.
L279389 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux.
L279313 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ -- FUCK OFF!
L279312 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Rob --!
L279305 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Marie LaSalle is in the store!  Here, she's here, and now!
L279304 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Liz, hold on a second --  What?
L279303 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Rob.
L279275 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ I want a tape.
L279274 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Let's not.
L279259 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Yeah.
L279258 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I always hated this song.
L279206 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Sure.  'Course.  Rob, look.  Do you want to... talk about it, that kind of thing?
L279205 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I understand, Dick.
L279204 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight.  I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that.  And he likes you.  It's just that --
L279203 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ I'll start with your news before I tell him mine, obviously.  Mine isn't much, really, just about Marie LaSalle  playing at Lounge Ax tonight.  I like her, you know, she's kind of Sheryl Crowish... but, you know, good.  So I'll tell him before that. Good news and bad news kind of thing.
L279202 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Fine.
L279201 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
L279200 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ 'Course I will, Rob.  No problem. No problem at all.  I'll tell him next time I see him.
L279199 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
L279198 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Are you all right?
L279162 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Can I help you?
L279161 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
L279127 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
L279126 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ What's this?
L279125 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Okay.
L279124 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Well, I'll just make it for you.
L279123 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
L279122 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ 'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You didn't see the cover though.
L279121 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No, that's okay.  Really.
L279120 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ I'll tape it for you.
L279119 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Great.
L279118 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The one on Testament of Youth.  Never released here.  Japanese import only.
L279117 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Good weekend?
L279116 +++$+++ u1317 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
L279115 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ 'Morning, Dick.
L279669 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Nothing to resolve, Ian.  Let's get a drink.
L279668 +++$+++ u1318 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ IAN +++$+++ Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
L279667 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
L279666 +++$+++ u1318 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ IAN +++$+++ Maybe I should talk to him.
L279665 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I'm upset, but I'm fine.
L279664 +++$+++ u1318 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ IAN +++$+++ You look upset.
L279663 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.
L279661 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.
L279660 +++$+++ u1318 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ IAN +++$+++ Laura?  Are you okay?
L279726 +++$+++ u1318 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ IAN +++$+++ Think about it, Rob.
L279725 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I dunno.
L279724 +++$+++ u1318 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ IAN +++$+++ So shall we leave it at that then?
L279720 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever.
L279719 +++$+++ u1318 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ IAN +++$+++ Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
L279718 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck!  Now get your patchouli stink out of my store.
L279717 +++$+++ u1318 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ IAN +++$+++ Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
L279716 +++$+++ u1318 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ IAN +++$+++ Think about it, Rob.
L279715 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I dunno.
L279714 +++$+++ u1318 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ IAN +++$+++ Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
L279713 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yeah.
L279712 +++$+++ u1318 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ IAN +++$+++ We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
L279711 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
L279710 +++$+++ u1318 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ IAN +++$+++ We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
L279709 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
L279708 +++$+++ u1318 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ IAN +++$+++ Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
L279707 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ What needs sorting out?
L279705 +++$+++ u1318 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ IAN +++$+++ Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray. Ian.
L279704 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Can I help you?
L280133 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ It's gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything.
L280132 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I'm an idiot.  I should have played the record first.  This place is about to get burned down.
L280129 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Well, you've asked.
L280128 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
L280127 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
L280126 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.
L280125 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
L280124 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
L280123 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ About what?
L280122 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
L280121 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ So?
L280120 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Fair enough.
L280119 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
L280118 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Are you persuadable?
L280117 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Very persuasive.
L280116 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I don't know.
L280115 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
L280114 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
L280113 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ No.  Probably not.
L280112 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Would you marry me if I was?
L280111 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
L280110 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Not in love, exactly, but...
L280109 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
L280108 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
L280107 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I know.
L280106 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I mean it.
L280105 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
L280104 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
L280103 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ What are you going to talk to me about?
L280102 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Right.
L280101 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I'm going to talk to you.
L280100 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?
L280099 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Not really.
L280098 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Are you worried about tomorrow night?
L280046 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I know.  I don't get it.
L280045 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
L280044 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk.  I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't.
L280041 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ We took care of that.
L280040 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
L280039 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
L280022 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Yeah.  His band is playing a set.
L280021 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Barry?  Barry knows about this?
L280020 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Barry said its done.
L280019 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
