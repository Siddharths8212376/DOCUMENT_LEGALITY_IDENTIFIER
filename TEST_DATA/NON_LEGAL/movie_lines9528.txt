L28385 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
L28384 +++$+++ u3607 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ This is for lawyers to talk about, this concerns a run-of-the-play contract, and this you can't rewrite or ad lib!
L28272 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ That's my Max.
L28271 +++$+++ u3607 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I promise.
L28270 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Promise.
L28269 +++$+++ u3607 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I don't know if this would be a wise move...
L28268 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
L28267 +++$+++ u3607 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Well...
L28266 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
L28265 +++$+++ u3607 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ But what could she do?
L28264 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max.
L28263 +++$+++ u3607 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
L28262 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You get quick action, don't you?
L28261 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Give Eve Harrington job in you office.
L28260 +++$+++ u3607 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ All you got to do is name it.
L28259 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-
L28258 +++$+++ u3607 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
L28257 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Anything to help you out, Max.
L28256 +++$+++ u3607 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Would you?
L28255 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
L28254 +++$+++ u3607 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ A couple of weeks.
L28253 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ When's the audition?
L28252 +++$+++ u3607 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
L28251 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation...
L28250 +++$+++ u3607 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ An audition for the part we're replacing. What's-her-name, your sister...
L28249 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Miss Caswell?  What?
L28248 +++$+++ u3607 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
L28247 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell...
L28245 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I love you, Max. I really mean it. I love you. Come to the pantry.
L28244 +++$+++ u3607 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Let the rest of the world beat their brains out for a buck. It's friends that count. And I got friends.
L28241 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Poor Max. Heartburn?  It's that Miss Caswell. I don't know why she doesn't give Addison heartburn.
L28240 +++$+++ u3607 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Margo. You by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house?
L28190 +++$+++ u3607 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
L28189 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?
L28188 +++$+++ u3607 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ How about me what?
L28187 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Make it Bergdorf Goodman... and now everything is on its proper shelf, eh, Max? Done up in little ribbons. I could die right now and nobody'd be confused. How about you, Max?
L29956 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ So I guess you could say that we screwed up, but we weren't wrong.
L29955 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ I finally got through to Sloan--it was all a misunderstanding that we had: he would have told the Grand Jury about Haldeman, he was ready to, only nobody on the Grand Jury asked him the goddamn question.
L29941 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Goddamnit!--
L29940 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ You overslept?
L29930 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Only everything...
L29929 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
L29928 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Hmm?
L29927 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Woodward?
L29908 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --We got twenty minutes to deadline--
L29907 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury. 
L29906 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman.
L29905 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ How many fucking sources they think we got?--
L29893 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --and the FBI confirms--what more do you need?--
L29892 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --Sloan told the Grand Jury--he answered everything they asked him-- that means there's a record somewhere--
L29887 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman--
L29886 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --Jesus--
L29877 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Maybe we are...
L29876 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
L29875 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
L29874 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ What's the matter?
L29873 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ It's nothing personal, though. 
L29872 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
L29871 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
L29870 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Nah.  Maybe.
L29869 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Haldeman.
L29868 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Who?
L29867 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ I think that's him.
L29855 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --we're working on the last guy now and we're going all the way--that fifth man was Haldeman.
L29854 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--
L29853 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control--
L29835 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ We're inside the White House now.
L29834 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ He'll give us a sworn statement.
L29799 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
L29798 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
L29797 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
L29796 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names.
L29755 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ You asking would I have been one of the President's men?  I would have been.
L29754 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ What would you have done?
L29721 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --'cause I only know four chords--
L29720 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ California, Illinois, Florida, New Hampshire--all the major Democratic primary states.  Why does everything you play sound the same?
L29719 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Segovia begged me for me secret but I said, "No, Andres, you'll have to try and make it without me."
L29718 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two.  Switch to another station, huh? You're driving me crazy with that.
L29717 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ If he self-destructed.
L29716 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed.
L29715 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece--
L29714 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.
L29713 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
L29712 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?
L29711 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --Haldeman I know, who else?
L29710 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
L29709 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ How high up, which Republicans?
L29708 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
L29707 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --I haven't said anything--
L29706 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --I want you to shut up and listen to me--
L29703 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Then he's got an ax.  Call him anyway.
L29702 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
L29701 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --has he got an ax?--
L29700 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --I know a lawyer at Justice--
L29699 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --shit, who do we know?--
L29698 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
L29697 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --I know, I know--
L29696 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --we gotta top the Times--
L29695 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --shit--
L29694 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Goddamnit--
L29690 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --just that a lot of reports were sent to CREEP, but he doesn't name who, not here anyway--
L29689 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --the lookout in the Motor Inn?--  --he say anything we don't know?--
L29688 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --The L.A. Times has a huge interview with Baldwin--
L29609 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ We'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it.
L29608 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Look--five men controlled that slush fund as CREEP--three of them we've got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and we're pretty sure of Kalmbach.
L29589 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --Colson.
L29588 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --there had to be a White House overseer--
L29564 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Nothing--I just found out that Jeb Magruder from CREEP is a bigger bike freak than I am.  I never like it when the other guy's human...
L29563 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Think Sloan's back?  What's wrong?
L29551 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ And I'll just shitkick in my usual way.
L29550 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ You want me to be the bastard.
L29549 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding--might surprise him if you're not.
L29548 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one?  Whichever.
L29547 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ How do you want to handle Sloan?
L29546 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ That happens to people.  OK, go on.
L29545 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
L29544 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --we will--
L29543 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
L29542 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
L29541 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in.
L29540 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Go on, go on--
L29539 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ I  couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth.
L29494 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ You voted for him.
L29493 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Did he just say what I think he said?
L29486 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Nixon.
L29485 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ '68.
L29484 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ When?
L29483 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Who'd you vote for?
L29482 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Sure.
L29481 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Republican?
L29480 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ And I'm a Republican.
L29479 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ I hate both parties.
L29473 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ We appreciate your position--really.
L29472 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --you believe in the President, you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal.
L29471 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ We understand your problem--
L29470 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ It's safe, try it, you'll see.
L29469 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.
L29466 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ I just wish we knew when someone would talk to us, that's all.
L29465 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars--those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down. What else do we know?
L29464 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
L29463 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Anything you've got.
L29462 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Facts or theory?
L29461 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?
L29460 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ I never scared anyone before.
L29459 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ This is terrific work, if you like rejection.
L29443 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ My first day as a copy boy I was sixteen and wearing my only grown-up suit--it was cream colored. At 2:30 the head copy boy comes running up to me and says, "My God, haven't you washed the carbon paper yet? If it's not washed by three, it'll never by dry for tomorrow."  And I said, "Am I supposed to do that?" and he said, "Absolutely, it's crucial." So I run around and grab all the carbon paper from all the desks and take it to the men's room. I'm standing there washing it and it's splashing all over me and the editor comes in to take a leak, and he says, "What the fuck do you think you're doing?" And I said, "It's 2:30. I'm washing the carbon paper."  Just wanted you to know I've done dumber things than get us lost, that's all.
L29442 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ You're not a kid anymore.
L29441 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ I don't get it... this really was my turf...
L29438 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.
L29437 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Who's first?
L29435 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...?
L29434 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Were you eyebrow reading?
L29433 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
L29432 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ And?--And?--
L29431 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.
L29430 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ See her?  Get anything?
L29279 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --you do?--with access to records?
L29278 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
L29277 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Why didn't we get that?
L29276 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ ---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--
L29275 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --fifteen phone calls--
L29274 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --I'm trying--
L29273 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --see?--
L29272 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Goddamnit--
L29271 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ The fucking New York Times.
L29270 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ What's that?
L29240 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ And you haven't called him?--
L29239 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
L29238 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ That was fun.  What now?
L29234 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ About the past year.
L29233 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ July of '71.
L29230 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ We need a sympathetic face.
L29229 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ You think they are confidential? I don't know anything about how this town works, I haven't lived here a year yet.
L29223 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ It makes sense; Hunt worked for the C.I.A. and the White House was paranoid about Teddy Kennedy.
L29222 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --a spy, you mean?
L29221 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Maybe a political operative of some sort--
L29220 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
L29219 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --what do you think?--
L29201 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ I lived here all my life, I got a million contacts, but they're all bus boys and bellhops.
L29200 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
L29199 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Hmm.
L29198 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Hey?
L29196 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Right. Nixon didn't get where he got by being dumb--  --listen, that was a Watergate question--
L29195 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ What, though?  It can't be the Republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway.
L29194 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ And McCord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the Democratic convention.  The Times has got to be full of it-- it can't be crazy Cubans.
L29193 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.
L29192 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.
L29191 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Let me lay a little theory on you--
L29190 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ All right, what do we know?
L29189 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ I was sure trying.
L29188 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
L29187 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.
L29186 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ You heard?  They put us both on the break-in thing. Simons liked the way we worked together.  Listen, I'm sorry I said your story was bullshit.
L29185 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Fuck you, Carl.
L29184 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Yeah?
L29183 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Carl?
L29182 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
L29181 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ What is it about my writing that's so rotten?
L29178 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --read 'em both and you'll see--
L29177 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --no way--
