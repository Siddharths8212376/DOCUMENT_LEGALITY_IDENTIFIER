L584058 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ No, he didn't.
L584057 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
L584023 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ [Beat] They're at Church. And I bet that's where Becker is.
L584022 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ William, you're not making sense.
L584021 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ They've got lives to be grateful for.
L584018 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ It's Sunday.
L584017 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
L584013 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ [Beat] I don't know.
L584012 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Then why isn't there anyone around?
L584011 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
L584010 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?
L584008 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ There're no cars on this street.
L584007 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ What? What are you thinking?
L584004 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ [Beat, lost] No.
L584003 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ They're not.
L584002 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ They're not here.
L584001 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
L584000 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ You're sure?
L583999 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.
L583998 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Me, too.
L583901 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
L583900 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ I might not be able to.
L583899 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
L583898 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days.
L583897 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say.
L583896 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
L583894 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ They told me Becker's in Shelbourne now. I looked him up and he was listed.
L583893 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ I don't know.
L583892 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ How long do we have?
L583865 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.
L583864 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Why?
L583863 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
L583862 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
L583861 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You think Lorenson kills you?
L583860 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ I have no idea.
L583859 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
L583858 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ I don't believe a thing she just said.
L583807 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
L583806 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ How? Did they figure it out after I died?
L583805 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I know.
L583804 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
L583803 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?
L583802 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
L583801 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ I know.
L583800 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
L583799 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Yes.
L583798 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ [Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
L583797 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
L583796 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Do you really believe me?
L583795 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I don't know how you got the cut to your head, but you died bleeding from it.
L583794 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ What?
L583793 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ [Beat] You bled to death.
L583792 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ After I...
L583791 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ But no one knew until after...
L583790 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ It was banned, you know... and it led to an investigation of Dr. Becker's mistreatment of some of his patients. That's when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients...
L583789 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Yeah.
L583788 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
L583640 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Please...
L583639 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
L583638 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I'm telling you I don't care what time you think you're in. You're not William Starks. [Beat] I don't believe in many things, but I believe in death. And it doesn't give back what it takes. So whoever you are...I did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave.
L583637 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ No, it's not. [Beat] It's December 25th, 2004.
L583636 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ It's December 25th, 1993 today.
L583635 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.
L583634 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.
L583633 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ How'd he die?
L583632 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
L583631 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ I gave you my dog tags.
L583630 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ How?
L583629 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I looked it up.
L583628 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ His body was found New Year's Day, 19...1993. At Alpine...
L583627 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ [Beat] What?
L583626 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
L583625 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ [Beat] What?
L583624 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
L583623 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
L583622 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
L583621 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Well, you belong in one.
L583620 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
L583619 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
L583618 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.
L583617 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ If you don't get out of my house right now, I'll call the police.
L583616 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ [Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
L583615 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything.
L583441 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
L583440 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ I think I can remember what's on them.
L583439 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ [Beat] In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are.
L583438 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ What for?
L583437 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.
L583436 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ What're those?
L583435 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.
L583434 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You're just gonna walk?
L583426 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L583425 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
L583424 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ But I like it I guess.
L583420 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Jackie.
L583419 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ [Beat] What's your name?
L583418 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Yeah, but I don't know what.
L583417 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Your mom take anything before this happened?
L583415 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Our car won't start.
L583414 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ You two ok?
L583413 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...
L583851 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.
L583850 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
L583838 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ I still don't either, even after all these years.
L583837 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I don't understand.
L583836 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
L583835 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ How?
L583834 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
L583833 +++$+++ u3248 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
L584142 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Good.
L584141 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
L584140 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ You know how to get there?
L584120 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ You'll figure it out and you'll do good by him.
L584119 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L584118 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.
L584117 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ You did, in the future. You figured it out because a part of you already knows this. That's how it works. [Beat] I'm just telling you something you already know, even if you haven't realized it.
L584116 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ Who told you this?
L584115 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ He's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly.
L584114 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Listen to me. That's all I ask.
L584113 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.
L584111 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ No. Listen to me...the kid, Eugene...
L584110 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ I do believe you...
L584109 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ You still don't believe me, do you?
L584108 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ I'm not gonna let that happen.
L584107 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ What for?
L584106 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Can I get some paper and something to write with.
L584105 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?
L584104 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.
L584097 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ You have nothing to fear, William.
L584096 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Who...who kills me?
L584095 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ Yeah.
L584094 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ I did?
L584093 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ You told me this was how it happened.
L584092 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ How...how do you know?
L584091 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?
L583946 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ NO! They're not my delusions! Look, just leave my business with Becker to me!
L583945 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
L583944 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true.
L583942 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ You told me about him. I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him. So you told me.
L583941 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ How do you know about Eugene?
L583939 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ William, that is just another facet of my delusions.
L583938 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
L583937 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ And how do you know that?
L583936 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
L583935 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ Why not?
L583934 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Because I don't have time.
L583933 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ Why don't you help me?
L583931 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Maybe.
L583930 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ [Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
L583927 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
L583926 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ What about the world?
L583925 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from.
L583924 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ The future doesn't look different?
L583923 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ It doesn't look all that different.
L583922 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
L583920 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ 2004.
L583919 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ Well, what time is it?
L583918 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ [Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
L583917 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Come on. Tell me what you do know.
L583916 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
L583913 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ This has nothing to do with that.
L583912 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
L583911 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ You don't understand.
L583909 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.
L583908 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
L583907 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ You have no idea what's going on.
L583906 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ What do you mean?
L583903 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ I'll die either way.
L583902 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.
L583857 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ [Beat] We will.
L583856 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
L583855 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Exactly.
L583854 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ [Beat] Yeah, it is.
L583853 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
L583849 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Why would we do that?
L583848 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.
L583846 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ My dad wrote some things down before he died.
L583845 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ How do you know about Dr. Becker?
L583844 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
L583843 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here.
L583842 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
L583841 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ [Beat] I don't know.
L583840 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ How'd he get it?
L583831 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ I was working with a boy named Eugene.
L583830 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ What case?
L583828 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ You thought my father was crazy?
L583827 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.
L583826 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Why?
L583825 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
L583824 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ I never knew my father. Did you?
L583823 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ My God you look exactly like him.
L583720 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Believe me, I know.
L583719 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.
L583718 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ So it's helping?
L583717 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ No. I don't want it to.
L583716 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ I could try to...make it stop.
L583715 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ Why, what would you do?
L583711 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ No. The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. Not my mind.
L583710 +++$+++ u3250 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ LORENSON +++$+++ You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged.
L583709 +++$+++ u3252 +++$+++ m215 +++$+++ STARKS +++$+++ That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
