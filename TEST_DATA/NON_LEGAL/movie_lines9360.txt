L485544 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Shit!
L485543 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ He's here.
L485542 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.
L485541 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ What about you, Buddy?
L485540 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Huh?
L485539 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
L485538 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Great!!!
L485537 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ We should act out our inner most fantasies.
L485536 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I was thinking the same thing.
L485535 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it.
L485534 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Yes...
L485533 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ That we should take our friendship a little further?
L485532 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...
L485531 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.
L485530 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.
L485505 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Hugh Kane.
L485504 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?
L485501 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand.
L485500 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Let's get outta here.
L485499 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ It looks like the furnace.
L485498 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Where the hell are we?
L485232 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Alright!
L485231 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...
L485230 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Her hair doesn't have as many split ends at yours. Her skin isn't as oily as yours, either. Also, sometimes your eyes get kinda squinty and they look like you might have Down's Syndrome or something. Otherwise the resemblance is uncanny.
L485229 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
L485228 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
L485225 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Shhh!
L485224 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Dude, somebody's on the rag.
L485222 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Wait, I'm just about to tell you the best part.
L485221 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Buddy...
L485219 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Okay.
L485218 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Sure. We can practice talking.
L485217 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
L485216 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
L485215 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
L485214 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Then what kinda stuff can we do?
L485213 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
L485212 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
L485211 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
L485088 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Open chest!!!
L485087 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Hi Buddy.
L485044 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Okay. See you later, friend.
L485043 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
L485042 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
L485041 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really nice, but I'm just getting over a really bad relationship, and I'm not ready to start dating yet.
L485040 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Maybe we can study together or something.
L485039 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Yeah.
L485038 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
L485037 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
L485036 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I meant you're into ghosts.
L485035 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ No. I never date outside my race.
L485034 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ So, I see you're really into spooks.
L485033 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Thanks. I'm Cindy.
L485032 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Hey, you left your book back there.
L485455 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ That means more screen time for us.
L485454 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ But he'll kill her!
L485453 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Let her go, Cin.
L485361 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ She killed herself a week before he died.
L485360 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ So, whatever happened to her?
L485359 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Okay, I get the point.
L485282 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Thanks, I'll be fine.
L485281 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Good-night, Cin. I'll be next door if you need me.
L485272 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ What, you think I did this to myself?
L485271 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got there I guess it was gone.
L485268 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Come on. We better get you cleaned up.
L485267 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I think so.
L485266 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Are you okay?
L485651 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Yeah, I broke my fall.
L485650 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
L485573 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.
L485572 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Where's Shorty?
L485570 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Right behind you.
L485569 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
L485568 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
L485567 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
L485566 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
L485108 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
L485107 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ How about these buns?
L485022 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I am. So just do me a favor and stay away from me.
L485021 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
L485020 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Oh, right.
L485019 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ It's the sequel.
L485018 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
L485017 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ It's okay.
L485016 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
L485733 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ Yes!!!!
L485732 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Noooo!!!
L485731 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
L485730 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ This can't be happening?
L485729 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
L485728 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Both of them?
L485727 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
L485726 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ It was you...
L485608 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ Made you say it!
L485607 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Stop! --
L485606 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Not in a thousand years.
L485605 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
L485598 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ Um, I'm not touching anything.
L485597 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Stop touching his brain!
L485592 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
L485591 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Hanson, please.
L485579 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.
L485578 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
L485113 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ Thanks. I made them by hand.
L485112 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Ummm!! They smell delicious.
L485061 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ I'm Hanson the caretaker.
L485060 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I'm Cindy.
L485057 +++$+++ u2640 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ HANSON +++$+++ Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you.
L485056 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Oh my God! I'm here with the...
L485641 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Alright, let's take a vote...
L485640 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  Nobody wants to go.
L485636 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I'll go.
L485635 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
L485429 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ We have to destroy him.
L485428 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ What are we gonna do?
L485424 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Quick, everyone to the lab.
L485423 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
L485185 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Just wait, you'll see.
L485184 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ What the hell are you doing?
L485030 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ I don't need your help.
L485029 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Would you like me to help you pass them back?
L485677 +++$+++ u2642 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ MCFEELY +++$+++ Soon, but first I must bless this house.
L485676 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
L485675 +++$+++ u2642 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ MCFEELY +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L485674 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ No, my friends are right here!
L485673 +++$+++ u2642 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ MCFEELY +++$+++ My child you are the only survivor.
L485672 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
L485671 +++$+++ u2642 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ MCFEELY +++$+++ We? What do you mean... we?
L485670 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Yes, we made it!
L485669 +++$+++ u2642 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ MCFEELY +++$+++ My child, you're alive!
L485668 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Father!
L485663 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ That turned out to be a good thing! It's gonna make smuggling a whole lot easier. Remember that weed? I'm about to get paid.
L485662 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
L485661 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ Hey, y'all! What's going on?
L485585 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ That's where my best customers are. Marion Berry, George Bush, the Redskins. I'd like to offer you a job, Cindy. Can you type? Take dictation? Swallow balloons filled with cocaine?
L485584 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Are you?
L485583 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
L485582 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
L485181 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ You better go get Dwight and the Professor.
L485180 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ Uh, uh.
L485179 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Did you do that?
L485178 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ I told you it would taste just like chicken.
L485177 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ That was a great idea, Shorty.
L485176 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ Hey, I got an idea.
L485175 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
L485174 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ Aww, the little bird died.
L484918 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ Almost... Look, I gotta bounce. I'll holla at you later.
L484917 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Am I cool now?
L484912 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ Yeah, you feel that? Now put it all together.
L484911 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
L484910 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
L484909 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Yo! That jacket is tight.
L484908 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
L484907 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
L484905 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.
L484904 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Oh.
L484903 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ Gear. You know, clothing.
L484902 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Huh?
L484901 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
L484900 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
L484899 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?
L484898 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ You could use the grade, huh?
L484897 +++$+++ u2646 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ SHORTY +++$+++ I don't know, but I sure hope so.
L484896 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ So, do you think you made it into the class?
L485301 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Don't touch me!!
L485300 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Saw who?!
L485299 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
L485297 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Who?
L485296 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I think she's starting to suspect something?
L485295 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
L485294 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ I don't like this, this...
L485293 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I wouldn't go that far.
L485292 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ I take it you're not mad at me.
L485287 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?
L485286 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Got a problem with that?
L485280 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ There's something going on in this house. I'm not crazy.
L485279 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss.
L485275 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Only that if this cat did attack, he's less likely to come back if the two of you were, let's say, together. Come on, it's college. Time for you two to experiment.
L485274 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ What are you getting at, Professor?
L485273 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together.
L485270 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Theo, did you see the animal?
L485269 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I'm telling you, it was possessed.
L485190 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.
L485189 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I got it!
L485188 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Got my camera right here.
L485187 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ It's some kind of energy field. We better record this.
L485186 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Yippie! Wasn't that amazing?
L485183 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.
L485182 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
L485140 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.
L485139 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Professor, what's the history of this house?
L485094 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.
L485093 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
L485409 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ The keys. She took the keys.
L485408 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
L485407 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ I can do it myself.
L485311 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves.
L485310 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
L485309 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ That's why we came here, remember?
L485308 +++$+++ u2638 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
