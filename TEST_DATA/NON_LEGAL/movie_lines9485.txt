L630614 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Don't tell me now. Tell me right before the test. I won't be able to remember long enough.
L630613 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
L630612 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Noooo...
L630611 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ You didn't do your homework?
L630610 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
L631111 +++$+++ u3381 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Brother, I hear you talkin'.
L631110 +++$+++ u3395 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Even this heavy work beats being at home with the old ball and chain.
L631108 +++$+++ u3395 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Yeah... look in here. Look at it from this angle.
L631107 +++$+++ u3381 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I did? I didn't see anything.
L631106 +++$+++ u3395 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ You missed somethin', Ed.
L631105 +++$+++ u3395 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Yep...  Yes...  It is.
L631104 +++$+++ u3381 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Nice night.
L631103 +++$+++ u3395 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I haven't got it yet.
L631102 +++$+++ u3381 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You got it.
L631101 +++$+++ u3395 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Fill 'er up.
L631100 +++$+++ u3381 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What'll it be?
L631099 +++$+++ u3395 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
L631098 +++$+++ u3381 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You know what that Big "E" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm.
L631097 +++$+++ u3395 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "E" starin' at me.
L631096 +++$+++ u3381 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hey, Pete. Can't believe your tank's dry up at the mill.
L630704 +++$+++ u3382 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'm so sorry, Laura.
L630703 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
L630702 +++$+++ u3382 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What about James? Can't James help you? You two are so in love.
L630701 +++$+++ u3382 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ But you're strong Laura... so much stronger than I... How can I help you? I can't. I can't even go outside.
L630700 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I hate him, I hate it. Sometimes I love it. But now I'm afraid. I am so afraid.
L630699 +++$+++ u3382 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Laura, no, I'm not. I'm not Bob.  Poor Laura. I wish I could help you.
L630698 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You're not Bob are you, Harold? If you are, you can kill me right now. Kill me right now, if you are.
L630693 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Oh, yes... yes...
L630692 +++$+++ u3382 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ No... No...
L630691 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
L630690 +++$+++ u3382 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What does Bob say?
L630689 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
L630688 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Bob is real. He's been "having" me since I was 12.
L630687 +++$+++ u3382 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Maybe.
L630686 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ The pages are gone. That's real.
L630685 +++$+++ u3382 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ But Bob isn't real.
L630684 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Bob.
L630683 +++$+++ u3382 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Who would do that?
L630682 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ My secret diary. There are pages missing.
L631146 +++$+++ u3385 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JACOBY +++$+++ Send me a kiss.
L631145 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
L631144 +++$+++ u3385 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JACOBY +++$+++ Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
L631143 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I already made you two tapes.
L631142 +++$+++ u3385 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JACOBY +++$+++ Did you make me a tape?
L631141 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I'm not.
L631140 +++$+++ u3385 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JACOBY +++$+++ A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
L631139 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
L631138 +++$+++ u3385 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JACOBY +++$+++ Laura, you didn't come and see me today.
L631228 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Let's go all the way.
L631227 +++$+++ u3386 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ We're on our way, Baby.
L631226 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
L631225 +++$+++ u3386 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Right on time, baby.
L630935 +++$+++ u3386 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ But it wasn't him... she was after a huge guy, six foot four with a broken nose. She said he looked just like a boxer. Speaking of sandwiches... I think Bobby was arranging something for you...  Speaking of arrangements...  SPEAKING OF ARRANGEMENTS... Why don't you two come up to the cabin this week? Leo and I know that Santy Claus is coming to town... Thursday.
L630934 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ What? She asked about my father?
L630933 +++$+++ u3386 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ That's right. She called me. She even asked me what your fathers looked like...
L630919 +++$+++ u3386 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ And what a muffin you have.
L630918 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I am The Muffin.
L630917 +++$+++ u3386 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ No "Jacques". I am the Great Went.
L630916 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Hey, Jacques...
L630915 +++$+++ u3386 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Baby, you know why? Cause it'll never get here.
L631218 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Right. Open your eyes, James. You don't know me. Even Donna doesn't know me. Your Laura disappeared... It's just me now.
L631217 +++$+++ u3387 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ See what?
L631216 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You want to see...
L631215 +++$+++ u3387 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
L631214 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Bobby killed a guy.
L631213 +++$+++ u3387 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ What?
L631212 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ When he finds out.
L631211 +++$+++ u3387 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ What?
L631210 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Shit, maybe he'll kill you.
L631209 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
L631208 +++$+++ u3387 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
L631207 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You mean the ones you pity.
L631206 +++$+++ u3387 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ You always hurt the ones you love.
L631205 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ "Oh, Laura..."
L631204 +++$+++ u3387 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Oh, Laura.
L631203 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Everything, but everything.
L631202 +++$+++ u3387 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
L631201 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You know it and I know it.
L631200 +++$+++ u3387 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ What do you mean?
L631199 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
L631198 +++$+++ u3387 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ What the hell is wrong with you?
L631053 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I just can't, James. I can't do it.
L631052 +++$+++ u3387 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ What's going on?
L631051 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I can't tonight.
L631050 +++$+++ u3387 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ What about tonight?
L631049 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
L631048 +++$+++ u3387 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ This afternoon?
L631047 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Not now.
L631046 +++$+++ u3387 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ I've got to see you.
L630848 +++$+++ u3387 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ When am I going to see you?
L630847 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ James...
L630846 +++$+++ u3387 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
L630845 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ How can I be together if I'm not together?
L630844 +++$+++ u3387 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ We were supposed to be together.
L630843 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
L630842 +++$+++ u3387 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.
L630643 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Gobble, gobble, gobble.
L630642 +++$+++ u3387 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
L630641 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
L630640 +++$+++ u3387 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ It does matter. We're in love.
L630639 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
L630638 +++$+++ u3387 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Why? It does.
L630637 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
L630636 +++$+++ u3387 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Laura, do you love me?
L630634 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Okay.
L630633 +++$+++ u3387 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
L630632 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ James...
L631081 +++$+++ u3391 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ They were looking for wood.
L631080 +++$+++ u3388 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ History is on our side, Ben. It's no accident that the great explorers were named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette.
L631077 +++$+++ u3388 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Exactment. They are nuts about wood. They get goofy over trees.
L631076 +++$+++ u3391 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Trees?
L631075 +++$+++ u3388 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You're getting warmer.
L631074 +++$+++ u3391 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Sex?
L631073 +++$+++ u3388 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You'd think so.
L631072 +++$+++ u3391 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Eating?
L631071 +++$+++ u3388 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ No.
L631070 +++$+++ u3391 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Hiking?
L631069 +++$+++ u3388 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ No.
L631068 +++$+++ u3391 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Boating?
L631067 +++$+++ u3388 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Johnny, Johnny... let your Daddy and your Uncle and Leland talk.  Ben... Leland, we can play the French against the Norwegians. What do the French love more than anything?
L630966 +++$+++ u3400 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ TRUMAN +++$+++ We throw away the whole head.
L630965 +++$+++ u3389 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I understand.
L630964 +++$+++ u3400 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ TRUMAN +++$+++ I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel. It's the custom thing I was thinking of. In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.
L630963 +++$+++ u3400 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ TRUMAN +++$+++ I saw a guy eat a fish eye once in Seattle. He was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat. I guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble. His throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing. And he couldn't swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still couldn't get the fish eye out and they tried to do a Heimlich maneuver. I went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy. They were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling. Splat! It just stuck up there and spread out. It was about the size of a half dollar. And that's why I don't ever eat fish eyes.
L630962 +++$+++ u3389 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
L630961 +++$+++ u3400 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ TRUMAN +++$+++ Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
L630960 +++$+++ u3389 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Fish eyes?
L630959 +++$+++ u3400 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ TRUMAN +++$+++ Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
L630958 +++$+++ u3389 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
L630957 +++$+++ u3400 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ TRUMAN +++$+++ What are you afraid of? What people think?
L630956 +++$+++ u3389 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
L630955 +++$+++ u3400 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ TRUMAN +++$+++ Josie, I think we should go public.
L631194 +++$+++ u3396 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Good night, sweetheart.
L631193 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Good night, Mom.
L631155 +++$+++ u3396 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ It's a school night... back by nine.
L631154 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
L631153 +++$+++ u3396 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
L631152 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Where's Dad?
L631151 +++$+++ u3396 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Sure you do, it's good for you.
L631150 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I hate asparagus.
L630862 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Mom, take it easy.
L630861 +++$+++ u3396 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.
L630860 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Mom... what are you wearing?
L630859 +++$+++ u3396 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Laura, now I can't find that blue sweater. Did you take it again?
L630712 +++$+++ u3396 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Now hurry, dinner's almost ready. Your father says he's starving.
L630711 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I'm sorry, Mom.
L630710 +++$+++ u3396 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
L630709 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
L630708 +++$+++ u3396 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
L630707 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ What were you doing in my room?
L630706 +++$+++ u3396 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
L630679 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ What?
L630678 +++$+++ u3396 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Laura.
L630677 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I forgot my books at school.
L630676 +++$+++ u3396 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Sure honey, what's the hurry?
L630675 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Can I take the car?
L631239 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ NO! YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.  KILL ME.
L631238 +++$+++ u3391 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ I always thought you knew it was me.
L631237 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
L631236 +++$+++ u3391 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.
L631149 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Stay away from me.
L631148 +++$+++ u3391 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Laura. What's wrong this morning?
L631024 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I was down the street.
L631023 +++$+++ u3391 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
L631022 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Oh, I thought I saw you.
L631021 +++$+++ u3391 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ No.
L631020 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Did you come home during the day last week?
L631019 +++$+++ u3391 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Yes.
L631018 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Dad?
L631017 +++$+++ u3391 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Yes.
L631016 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Are you sure you're okay?
L631013 +++$+++ u3391 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?
L631012 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
L631011 +++$+++ u3391 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ We're late to get to your mother.
L631010 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ No.
L631009 +++$+++ u3391 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
L631008 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?
L630852 +++$+++ u3391 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ A special friend?
L630851 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ A friend from school.
L630850 +++$+++ u3391 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Who was that?
L630818 +++$+++ u3391 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Your hands are filthy... look, there is dirt way under this fingernail.
L630817 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Dad...
