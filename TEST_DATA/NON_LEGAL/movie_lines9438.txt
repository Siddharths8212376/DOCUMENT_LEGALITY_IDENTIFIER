L569183 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I keep wanting to do that -- fling open the door -- let the light in, clean everything out. If I could get a huge eraser and rub everything out... starting with myself... the thing is, Peter, if...
L569181 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
L569180 +++$+++ u3124 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
L569179 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
L569178 +++$+++ u3124 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
L569177 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
L569176 +++$+++ u3124 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
L569167 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Just because he doesn't like Americans!
L569166 +++$+++ u3124 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ He's already angry, I don't think --
L569165 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
L569164 +++$+++ u3124 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
L569162 +++$+++ u3124 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ He says so many fiancées.
L569161 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ What did he say?
L569159 +++$+++ u3124 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha molte fidanzate.
L569158 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Tell him I have a fiancée, Dickie has a fiancée and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.
L569157 +++$+++ u3124 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
L569156 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ No.
L569151 +++$+++ u3124 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I don't know how to translate that.  E difficile... il signor Ripley... dormiva all'aperto, con un...
L569150 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I've been backpacking.
L569147 +++$+++ u3124 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.
L569146 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ In Rome, about three weeks ago.  I knew that one.
L569139 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench I can hardly breathe.
L569138 +++$+++ u3124 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
L569137 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --
L569136 +++$+++ u3124 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ That's good, isn't it?
L569135 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
L569134 +++$+++ u3124 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.
L569133 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ It's okay.
L569132 +++$+++ u3124 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Welcome to Venice. This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day.
L569131 +++$+++ u3124 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous.
L569130 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ What rumour?
L569129 +++$+++ u3124 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?
L569128 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.
L569018 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ It's fantastic.  I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand this, but anytime Dickie does something I feel guilty.
L569017 +++$+++ u3124 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
L569016 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ My God.
L569008 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Hi.  Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've seen a ghost...
L569007 +++$+++ u3124 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Not at all. Morning Tom.
L569006 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
L568973 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.  It's really good to meet you.
L568972 +++$+++ u3124 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ We'll be there.
L568971 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Ten thirty?
L568970 +++$+++ u3124 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
L568969 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?
L568968 +++$+++ u3124 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ And tomorrow?
L568967 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I can't later.
L568966 +++$+++ u3124 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Will we see you later?
L568963 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Thanks.
L568962 +++$+++ u3124 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Well hurry, before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
L568961 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
L568960 +++$+++ u3124 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around.
L568956 +++$+++ u3124 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?
L568955 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Ditto.
L569122 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Tomorrow.
L569121 +++$+++ u3126 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ ROVERINI +++$+++ I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then?
L569120 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Absolutely.
L569119 +++$+++ u3126 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ ROVERINI +++$+++ Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
L569118 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
L569117 +++$+++ u3126 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ ROVERINI +++$+++ You have, yes.
L569116 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I have!
L569115 +++$+++ u3126 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ ROVERINI +++$+++ Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
L569114 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ It is a little coarse, yes.
L569113 +++$+++ u3126 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ ROVERINI +++$+++ Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
L569112 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
L569111 +++$+++ u3126 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ ROVERINI +++$+++ Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
L569110 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when.
L569109 +++$+++ u3126 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ ROVERINI +++$+++ May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancée?
L569108 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Thank you.
L569107 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Let her in, what's the difference? Let her in.  No, actually, no, I'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later.
L569106 +++$+++ u3126 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ ROVERINI +++$+++ That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge Sherwood.
L569105 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ 31 people.
L569104 +++$+++ u3126 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ ROVERINI +++$+++ 31 people.
L569103 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence. There must be fifty hotels in San Remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day.
L569102 +++$+++ u3126 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ ROVERINI +++$+++ No. Here is a pattern. Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead -- he leaves your apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks, and the owner tells the Police it was stolen on November 7th. We look at hotel records and we see oh! Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then our boatman remembers two Americans taking a boat.
L569101 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ No!
L569100 +++$+++ u3126 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ ROVERINI +++$+++ Does he stay with you here?
L569099 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ A few days ago.
L569098 +++$+++ u3126 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ ROVERINI +++$+++ And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
L569097 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I don't remember the exact date.
L569096 +++$+++ u3126 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ ROVERINI +++$+++ November 7th is my information.
L569095 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
L569094 +++$+++ u3126 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ ROVERINI +++$+++ November, I thought.
L569093 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago.
L569091 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ What about Ripley?
L569090 +++$+++ u3126 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ ROVERINI +++$+++ What about Thomas Ripley?
L569089 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Even her.
L569088 +++$+++ u3126 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ ROVERINI +++$+++ Even your fiancée...?
L569087 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I really don't want to see anybody.
L569086 +++$+++ u3126 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ ROVERINI +++$+++ Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiancée.
L569085 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm feeling hounded -- do you think you could not give out my address?
L569084 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers.
L569083 +++$+++ u3126 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ ROVERINI +++$+++ Of course. What happened to your face?
L569082 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Can we go up? Do you mind?
L569067 +++$+++ u3126 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ ROVERINI +++$+++ No.
L569066 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
L569065 +++$+++ u3126 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ ROVERINI +++$+++ Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.
L569064 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Postmortem?
L569063 +++$+++ u3126 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ ROVERINI +++$+++ So, the Doctor, he has to make the --  -- come se dice?
L569062 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
L569061 +++$+++ u3126 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ ROVERINI +++$+++ Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.
L569060 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him?
L569059 +++$+++ u3126 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ ROVERINI +++$+++ So Signor Miles drove away and you did what?
L569058 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
L569057 +++$+++ u3126 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ ROVERINI +++$+++ It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?
L569056 +++$+++ u3126 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ ROVERINI +++$+++ Inspector Roverini. Can we come in?
L569055 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Yes?
L569054 +++$+++ u3126 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ ROVERINI +++$+++ Dickie Greenleaf?
L569751 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Nah. I ain't interested.
L569750 +++$+++ u3128 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box.
L569749 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Huh?
L569748 +++$+++ u3128 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ You like ball games?
L569746 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ They'd never get me to go back. They'd have to shoot me first.  You got anything to carry these in? 
L569745 +++$+++ u3128 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ It's hell out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over. 
L569744 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Yeah. I was all around. One hospital, then the next.
L569743 +++$+++ u3128 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Vietnam? I saw it on your jacket. Where were you? Bet you got to handle a lot of weapons out there.
L569742 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Huh?
L569741 +++$+++ u3128 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ You in Nam? Can't help but notice your jacket?
L569740 +++$+++ u3128 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle.
L569739 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Is there a firing range around?
L569738 +++$+++ u3128 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
L569737 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Nah, this'll be fine.
L569736 +++$+++ u3128 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as the Empire State Building.
L569735 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ How much to get a permit to carry?
L569734 +++$+++ u3128 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.
L569733 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ How much for everything.
L569732 +++$+++ u3128 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ That's the Colt .25 -- a fine little gun. Don't do a lot of damage, but it's as fast as the Devil. Handy little gun, you can carry it almost anywhere. I'll throw it in for another $125.
L569731 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
L569730 +++$+++ u3128 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?
L569727 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ I got money.
L569726 +++$+++ u3128 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ That's an expensive gun.
L569725 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ You got a .44 Magnum?
L570071 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Sure.
L570070 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?
L570069 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Yeah.
L570068 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Travis?
L570067 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Thank you, Travis.
L570066 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ No, no, please. This fare's on me. Please.
L570064 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really. The papers always blow these things up.  A little stiffness. That'll go away. I just sleep more, that's all.
L570063 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
L570062 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Well, I hope he wins.
L570061 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
L570060 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ I see where Palantine got the nomination.
L570059 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Hello, Betsy.
L570058 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Hello, Travis.
L569688 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Can I call you?
L569687 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Keep it.
L569686 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ What about the record?
L569685 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ I'm getting a taxi.
L569684 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ But... Betsy...
L569683 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
L569682 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Huh?
L569681 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
L569680 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
L569679 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and all that, but I think this is it. I'm going home.
L569678 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ ...there's plenty of movies around here. I haven't seen any of them, but I'm sure they're good.
L569676 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ We can go to another movie if you like, I don't care. I got money. There's plenty...
L569675 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ My God!
L569674 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Well... mostly...
L569673 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ I mean porno movies.
L569672 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ This is sort of high class...
L569671 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to?
L569670 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Well, I don't follow movies too much...
L569669 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ These are not the kind of movies I go to.
L569668 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ What do you mean?
L569667 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ I'm leaving.
L569666 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Where are you going?
L569665 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ I forgot to get the Coca-Cola.
L569664 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ What's wrong?
L569663 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Damn.
L569662 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them.
L569661 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ But this is a porno movie.
L569660 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ I bought a couple of tickets.
L569659 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ What are you doing?
L569658 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ No.  I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
L569657 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ So you haven't heard this record yet?
L569656 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
L569655 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
L569654 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
L569653 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Travis, you haven't even played the record?
L569652 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ He'll, what else can I do with it all?
L569651 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ You didn't have to spend your money -- ?
L569630 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Kris Kristofferson.
L569629 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
L569628 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ The singer?
L569627 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Oh. Who was that again?
L569626 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
L569625 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
L569624 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 
L569623 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ What?
L569622 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ You know what you remind me of?
L569621 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ It keeps ya busy.
L569620 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ You must be rich.
L569619 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
L569618 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
L569617 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
L569616 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ What hours do you work?
L569615 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.  I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
L569614 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
L569613 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
L569612 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
