L521914 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ Pleased to meet you.
L521913 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ This is my friend Josephine - she's going to be a bridesmaid.
L521629 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Sorry.
L521628 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ You're leading again.
L521627 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Yes, Osgood?
L521626 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ Daphne...
L521522 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ You're a pretty hot little firecracker yourself.
L521521 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
L521520 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
L521519 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ About that roadhouse -
L521518 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ Who?
L521517 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Well, I'll be - !  He does have a bicycle.
L521516 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ Well, then, why don't we go dancing? I know a little road-house, down the coast -
L521515 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'll throw up!
L521514 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ But it's such a waste - a full moon - an empty yacht -
L521235 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ No, thank you.  I'll walk.
L521234 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ Please.  It won't happen again.
L521231 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ Oh, you don't get off that easy.
L521230 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ This is where I get off.
L521229 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ Goodbye?
L521228 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.
L521227 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.
L521226 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Why?
L521225 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
L521224 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Wanna bet?
L521223 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ You must be quite a girl.
L521222 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Most of the time I slap it.
L521221 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
L521220 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Bull fiddle.
L521219 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
L521218 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.
L521217 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ If I promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight?
L521216 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
L521215 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
L521214 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'm not surprised.
L521213 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
L521212 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You're not sure?
L521211 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ No - it's showgirls.  I've been married seven or eight times.
L521210 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You invest in shows?
L521209 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ Yes, indeed.  It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
L521208 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You don't say.
L521207 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
L521206 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Personally, I'm Type O.
L521205 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ It certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here.
L521204 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Thank you.  Aren't you a sweetheart?
L521203 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ Let me carry one of the instruments.
L521202 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Me too.  Bye now.
L521201 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ If there is one thing I admire, it's a girl with a shapely ankle.
L521200 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I am Cinderella the Second.
L521199 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
L521198 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Help yourself.
L521197 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ Just a moment, miss -  May I?
L521471 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ That's good thinking.  Daphne's a push-over for him.
L521470 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ Oh, that's all taken care of.  I'm giving them shore leave.  We'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and I checked with the Coast Guard - there'll be a full moon tonight - oh, and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records -
L521469 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Just the two of you?  What about the crew?
L521468 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ The New Caledonia.  That's the name of it.  The Old Caledonia went down during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.  But tell her not to worry - this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack - just the two of us.
L521467 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Got it.  Supper - yacht - after the show - I'll tell her.  Your yacht?
L521466 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ Well, it is to me.  Will you give her a message?  I'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.
L521465 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ This is her roommate.  Daphne can't talk right now.  Is it anything urgent?
L521767 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh, no!
L521766 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ I don't mean to be forward - but ain't I had the pleasure of meeting you two broads before?
L520843 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ You won't breathe nothing' - not even air.
L520842 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ We won't breathe a word.
L520841 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ I don't like no witnesses.
L520838 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ You ain't going nowhere.
L520837 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ To Urbana.  It's a hundred miles.
L520836 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ Wait a minute.  Where do you think you're going?
L520835 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
L520834 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ Don't I know you two from somewhere?
L520798 +++$+++ u7716 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ NELLIE +++$+++ My car?  Why, you -
L520797 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
L520796 +++$+++ u7716 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ NELLIE +++$+++ Yes, Joe.
L520795 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ And you'll be in all evening?
L520794 +++$+++ u7716 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ NELLIE +++$+++ I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -
L520793 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Because I got some plans -
L520792 +++$+++ u7716 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ NELLIE +++$+++ Why?
L520791 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Please, Jerry - that's no way to talk.  Nellie baby - what are you doing tonight?
L520727 +++$+++ u7716 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ NELLIE +++$+++ It's three weeks in Florida -
L520726 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What's the job?
L520721 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ The minute we get a job, I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
L520720 +++$+++ u7716 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ NELLIE +++$+++ You're making it up pretty good so far.
L520719 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
L520718 +++$+++ u7716 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ NELLIE +++$+++ Oh?
L520709 +++$+++ u7716 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ NELLIE +++$+++ What a heel!  I spend four dollars to get my hair marcelled, I buy me a new negligee, I bake him a great big pizza pie...  - and where were you?
L520708 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Now look, Nellie - if it's about last Saturday night - I can explain everything.
L520706 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Thank you.
L520705 +++$+++ u7716 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ NELLIE +++$+++ Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -
L520704 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Anything today?
L520781 +++$+++ u7719 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ POLIAKOFF +++$+++ You got it.  It's six dollars a man.  Be on the campus in Urbana at eight o'clock -
L520780 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ We'll take it!
L520779 +++$+++ u7719 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ POLIAKOFF +++$+++ Look, if you boys want to pick up a little money tonight -  At the University of Illinois they are having - you should excuse the expression - a St. Valentine's dance.
L520768 +++$+++ u7719 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ POLIAKOFF +++$+++ William Morris!
L520767 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No, we couldn't!
L520761 +++$+++ u7719 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ POLIAKOFF +++$+++ You got to be under twenty-five -
L520760 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What kind of band is this, anyway?
L520759 +++$+++ u7719 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ POLIAKOFF +++$+++ It's not the backs that worry me.
L520758 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?
L520755 +++$+++ u7719 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ POLIAKOFF +++$+++ The instruments are right, but you are not.  I want to speak to Mr. Morris.
L520754 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
L520753 +++$+++ u7719 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ POLIAKOFF +++$+++ What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
L520748 +++$+++ u7719 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ POLIAKOFF +++$+++ Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
L520747 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
L520977 +++$+++ u7721 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ There are two things I will not put up with during working hours.  One is liquor - and the other one is men.
L520976 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ We got time off for good behavior.
L520962 +++$+++ u7721 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ All right - lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you?
L520961 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ We got it second-hand.
L520957 +++$+++ u7721 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Would you mind rejoining the living? Goose it up a little.
L520956 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No - funerals.
L520955 +++$+++ u7721 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Hey, Sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances?
L520879 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes, we're the new girls.
L520878 +++$+++ u7721 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
L520877 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Well, here we are.
L521926 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ That's right - pour it on.  Talk me out of it.
L521925 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
L521924 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I know.  Every time!
L521923 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You don't want me, Sugar - I'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-goodnicks you've been running away from -
L521921 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I told you - I'm not very bright.
L521920 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
L521848 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ How can I?  No matter where I go, there'll always be a Shell station on the corner.  I'll bring this back when it's empty.
L521847 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You'll forget him, Sugar.
L521846 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
L521845 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Daphne -
L521837 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I don't know.  All of a sudden, I'm thirsty.
L521836 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What's the matter, Sugar?
L521826 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Goodbye, my darling.
L521825 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage.  And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
L521824 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh.  The navigator just came in - we're ready to cast off.
L521823 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I didn't do anything.  It just happened.
L521822 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
L521821 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
L521820 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What's what?  Oh, that.  just a little going away present.
L521819 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Yes, they're here.  Oh - white orchids.  Would you believe it - I haven't had white orchids since I was a debutante.  What's this?
L521816 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Smart move.  Oh, by the way - did you get my flowers? You know, those orchids from my greenhouse - the fog finally lifted over Long Island, and they flew them down this morning.
L521815 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ But you have.  You've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.
L521814 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I only wish there were something I could do for you.
L521813 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I knew you would.
L521812 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Oh, of course.  I understand.  At least, I think I do.
L521811 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
L521810 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?
L521809 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ It's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the Venezuelan syndicate has a daughter, and -
L521808 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ You're not?
L521807 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Quite a while.  As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.
L521806 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ A merger?  How long will you be gone?
L521805 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela - and I just got a cable from Dad - the board of directors decided on a merger.
L521804 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
L521803 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.
L521802 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Tomorrow night?
L521801 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm afraid not.  I can't make it tonight.
L521800 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
L521799 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
L521798 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.
L521706 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Daphne has a beau - I have a beau - if we could only find somebody for you.
L521705 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Me?
L521704 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.
L521703 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ From a rich millionaire.
L521702 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Really?
L521699 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - I think he's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve.
L521698 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Gee, I wish I'd been there.
L521693 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Nice?  It was suicidally beautiful.
L521692 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Did you have a nice time?
L521691 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Oh, no.  I'm off that stuff - for good.
L521647 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Let's make it an even million.
L521646 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
L521645 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
L521644 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Good morning.
L521643 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Good night.
L521641 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Oh, you know - Junior League - charity bazaars - I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.
L521640 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Where did you learn to kiss like that?
L521639 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Mineral baths - now really!
L521638 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ They told me I was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.
L521637 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Thank you.
L521636 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I never knew it could be like this.
L521635 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.
L521634 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I think you're on the right track.
L521633 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Lets throw another log on the fire.
L521632 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I got a funny sensation in my toes - like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
L521631 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm not quite sure.  Try it again.
L521630 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Well - ?
L521625 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ So inhale!
L521624 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ It's like smoking without inhaling.
L521623 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ You're not giving yourself a chance. Don't fight it.  Relax. 
L521622 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Look, it's terribly sweet of you to want to help out - but it's no use.  I think the light switch is over there -  - and that's the radio.  It's like taking somebody to a concert when he's tone deaf.
L521621 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
L521620 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
L521619 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Anything this time?
L521618 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ All right - if you insist.
L521617 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
L521616 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What is it?
L521615 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Would you do me a favor?
L521614 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
L521613 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
L521612 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
L521611 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
L521610 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Thanks just the same.
L521609 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Is that anything?
L521608 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Why?
L521607 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Have you ever tried American girls?
L521606 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
L521605 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Is it that hopeless?
L521604 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What else is there for me?
