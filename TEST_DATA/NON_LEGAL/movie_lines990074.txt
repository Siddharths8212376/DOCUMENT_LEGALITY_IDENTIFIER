L342463 +++$+++ u6288 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ WEBB +++$+++ I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
L342462 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
L342461 +++$+++ u6288 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ WEBB +++$+++ And what is that?
L342460 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
L342811 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ The decision is final.
L342810 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Sir!
L342809 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Death and honor are sometimes thought to be the same. Today I have learned that they are not.
L342808 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
L342807 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ I have lived to see two things I never expected.  An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.
L342796 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ You have heard your answer, Monsieur le Marquis. 
L342795 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ This is the signature of Webb.  And I know the temper of our men. Rather than spend the war in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end.
L342764 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England's policies in her own colonies? To come and go without so much as a "by your leave."
L342763 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.
L342659 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.
L342658 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Things were done. Nobody was spared...
L342651 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Only twelve miles away! He could be here day after tomorrow.  Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you the message.
L342650 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L342649 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Webb's at Edward?
L342648 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to Fort Edward two days ago.
L342645 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Logistics are his guns are bigger than mine and he has more of them. They keep our heads down while his sappers make thirty yards of trench a day. His thirteen inch mortars have a two hundred yard range, so when they're close enough, they'll move them in, lob explosive rounds over our walls and pound us to dust. They look to be three hundred yards out.  Bloody murderers.  You have three days.
L342644 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
L342643 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ What a place for them...
L342635 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Thank you. How can I reward you?
L342634 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
L342633 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ What happened to you?
L342632 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements!
L342631 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Does Webb not even know we are besieged?
L342846 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Fire!
L342845 +++$+++ u6287 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ SERGEANT MAJOR +++$+++ Right - about face! March! First rank present!
L342843 +++$+++ u6287 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ SERGEANT MAJOR +++$+++ Yes sir!
L342842 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!
L342701 +++$+++ u6287 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ SERGEANT MAJOR +++$+++ Atten-hut!
L342700 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
L342699 +++$+++ u6287 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ SERGEANT MAJOR +++$+++ Sir!
L342698 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Sergeant Major!
L342696 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Fire!!!
L342695 +++$+++ u6287 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ SERGEANT MAJOR +++$+++ Shoulder arms!  Present! 
L342694 +++$+++ u6287 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ SERGEANT MAJOR +++$+++ Sir!!!  Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!
L342693 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Advance, Sergeant Major!
L342692 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Fire!!!
L342691 +++$+++ u6287 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ SERGEANT MAJOR +++$+++ First rank! Second rank! Present arms! 
L342690 +++$+++ u6287 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ SERGEANT MAJOR +++$+++ Sir!  Upon the center, wheel to the left- about!  March!  Rear ranks, proper distance!  Front ranks, take your distance! March!  Halt!  Make ready! 
L342689 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Sergeant! Form three ranks!
L342913 +++$+++ u6283 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MAGUA +++$+++ Heart. Give Magua new heart.
L342912 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ What is enough?
L342910 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ The King? The King has mountains of gold!
L342909 +++$+++ u6283 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MAGUA +++$+++ How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
L342908 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Yes.
L342907 +++$+++ u6283 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MAGUA +++$+++ For Munro children?
L342906 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Gold could be arranged.
L342905 +++$+++ u6283 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MAGUA +++$+++ Yengeese Major give all property to Magua.  Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, many gifts, maybe three, four oxen.
L342904 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Yes.
L342903 +++$+++ u6283 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MAGUA +++$+++ Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
L342902 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Yes.
L342901 +++$+++ u6283 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MAGUA +++$+++ Wampum?
L342900 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Three, four oxen... much wampum.
L342899 +++$+++ u6283 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MAGUA +++$+++ Gifts?
L342898 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers... will receive many gifts.
L342511 +++$+++ u6283 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MAGUA +++$+++ Magua say: "Yes. Good idea."
L342510 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Excuse me. What did you say?
L342509 +++$+++ u6283 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MAGUA +++$+++ "Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness."
L342508 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
L342507 +++$+++ u6283 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MAGUA +++$+++ I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
L342506 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ We must... stop... soon. Women are... tired.  You... understand?
L342730 +++$+++ u6281 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Does the rule of English law no longer govern?  Has it been replaced by absolutism?
L342729 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ This interview's over! The militia stays!
L342728 +++$+++ u6281 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
L342727 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
L342726 +++$+++ u6281 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ We are not forgettin' Webb's promise!
L342715 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not you.
L342714 +++$+++ u6281 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.
L342713 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ I must receive proof more conclusive than Mr. Poe's opinion before I weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw.
L342836 +++$+++ u6283 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MAGUA +++$+++ Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.
L342835 +++$+++ u6284 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MONTCALM +++$+++ Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
L342834 +++$+++ u6283 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MAGUA +++$+++ Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
L342833 +++$+++ u6284 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MONTCALM +++$+++ My son Magua's pain is my pain.
L342832 +++$+++ u6283 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MAGUA +++$+++ Magua slept hard in the English wigwams.  And the sticks left their mark...  Magua's village and lodges were burnt. Magua's children were killed by the English.  Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of all this.  In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free. In his heart he always was Huron.  And his heart will be whole again on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!
L342831 +++$+++ u6284 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MONTCALM +++$+++ My son has been sadly injured. Who did this?
L342830 +++$+++ u6283 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MAGUA +++$+++ And this?
L342829 +++$+++ u6284 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MONTCALM +++$+++ That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
L342827 +++$+++ u6284 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MONTCALM +++$+++ That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.
L342826 +++$+++ u6283 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MAGUA +++$+++ Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
L342825 +++$+++ u6284 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MONTCALM +++$+++ But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
L342824 +++$+++ u6283 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MAGUA +++$+++ Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.  It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be buried.
L342823 +++$+++ u6284 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MONTCALM +++$+++ My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
L342822 +++$+++ u6283 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MAGUA +++$+++ Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
L342821 +++$+++ u6284 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MONTCALM +++$+++ Yes.
L342820 +++$+++ u6283 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MAGUA +++$+++ Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father?
L342671 +++$+++ u6283 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MAGUA +++$+++ When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his children under the knife so the Grey Hair will see his seed is wiped out forever.
L342670 +++$+++ u6284 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MONTCALM +++$+++ Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua?
L342813 +++$+++ u6284 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MONTCALM +++$+++ Granted, Monsieur.
L342812 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon.
L342806 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Allow me to consult with my officers.
L342805 +++$+++ u6284 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MONTCALM +++$+++ Carry them to England to your King with pride.
L342804 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ My colors?
L342803 +++$+++ u6284 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MONTCALM +++$+++ Granted.
L342802 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ The honors of war?
L342801 +++$+++ u6284 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MONTCALM +++$+++ They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition... Other than that, ask what you wish.
L342800 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Their arms?
L342799 +++$+++ u6284 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MONTCALM +++$+++ My master requires the fort be destroyed.  But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.
L342798 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Such as...?
L342791 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb...?
L342790 +++$+++ u6284 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MONTCALM +++$+++ Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.  Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?
L342789 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
L342788 +++$+++ u6284 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MONTCALM +++$+++ You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
L342787 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
L342786 +++$+++ u6284 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MONTCALM +++$+++ Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
L342785 +++$+++ u6285 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
L342784 +++$+++ u6284 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MONTCALM +++$+++ Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
L342819 +++$+++ u6284 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MONTCALM +++$+++ Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
L342818 +++$+++ u6286 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ SENTRY +++$+++ C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
L342817 +++$+++ u6284 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MONTCALM +++$+++ La victoire.
L342816 +++$+++ u6286 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ SENTRY +++$+++ Le mot d'ordre?
L342815 +++$+++ u6284 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ MONTCALM +++$+++ France.
L342814 +++$+++ u6286 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ SENTRY +++$+++ Qui vive?
L347669 +++$+++ u6289 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ BECK +++$+++ Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
L347668 +++$+++ u6293 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ Be careful with it.
L347660 +++$+++ u6293 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ Intelligence may not be the right word...
L347659 +++$+++ u6289 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ BECK +++$+++ That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
L347591 +++$+++ u6289 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ BECK +++$+++ Well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that Russian ship?  Why isn't he out swimming around?
L347590 +++$+++ u6293 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
L347589 +++$+++ u6289 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ BECK +++$+++ But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
L347588 +++$+++ u6293 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
L347587 +++$+++ u6293 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ It was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water.  Most homo sapiens didn't make it...Danakil man... <u>adapted</u>.
L347586 +++$+++ u6289 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ BECK +++$+++ Not exactly a big ocean country.
L347585 +++$+++ u6293 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
L347584 +++$+++ u6289 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ BECK +++$+++ Was there such a thing?
L347583 +++$+++ u6293 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
L347582 +++$+++ u6289 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ BECK +++$+++ They found this?
L347484 +++$+++ u6289 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ BECK +++$+++ Yeah...right...
L347483 +++$+++ u6293 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
L347482 +++$+++ u6289 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ BECK +++$+++ Why Sixpack?
L347481 +++$+++ u6293 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
L347480 +++$+++ u6289 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ BECK +++$+++ And?
L347479 +++$+++ u6293 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
L347478 +++$+++ u6289 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ BECK +++$+++ The mask is because you think it might be...catching?
L347477 +++$+++ u6293 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ For this...you don't need to be.
L347476 +++$+++ u6289 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ BECK +++$+++ I'm not a doctor.
L347475 +++$+++ u6293 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ Here.  Put this on.  You examine him.
L347474 +++$+++ u6289 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ BECK +++$+++ Well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours?!
L347473 +++$+++ u6293 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ He did.
L347472 +++$+++ u6289 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ BECK +++$+++ Dead?  This morning you said he had some skin disorder.
L347439 +++$+++ u6293 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.
L347438 +++$+++ u6289 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ BECK +++$+++ What's wrong?
L347389 +++$+++ u6289 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ BECK +++$+++ What mistakes?  Look, I think it's no big deal but if you want to find out why this ship sank have Maritime run a check.
L347388 +++$+++ u6293 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
L347387 +++$+++ u6289 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ BECK +++$+++ What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
L347382 +++$+++ u6289 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ BECK +++$+++ Be my guest.
L347381 +++$+++ u6293 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ You mind if I take a look at this?
L347246 +++$+++ u6289 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ BECK +++$+++ We almost had an accident today. DeJesus' suit...
L347245 +++$+++ u6293 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
L347244 +++$+++ u6289 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ BECK +++$+++ Are you planning on working tomorrow?
L347778 +++$+++ u6289 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ BECK +++$+++ Just get in yours!
L347777 +++$+++ u6294 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Your suit, Becky!
L347770 +++$+++ u6289 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ BECK +++$+++ I got hung up!  Try this!
L347769 +++$+++ u6294 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Where the hell've you been?
L347763 +++$+++ u6294 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Fuck your orders!
L347762 +++$+++ u6289 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ BECK +++$+++ That's an order!
L347761 +++$+++ u6294 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ No!
L347760 +++$+++ u6289 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ BECK +++$+++ Go on!
L347750 +++$+++ u6289 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ BECK +++$+++ No.
L347749 +++$+++ u6294 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
L347748 +++$+++ u6294 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ I am thinking, man!  You think I want to die!  I am thinking!  I--
L347747 +++$+++ u6289 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ BECK +++$+++ Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
L347746 +++$+++ u6294 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ No way...
L347745 +++$+++ u6289 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ BECK +++$+++ Can you fix it?
L347744 +++$+++ u6294 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Jesus Christ...
