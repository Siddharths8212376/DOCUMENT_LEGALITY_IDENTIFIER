L568424 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.
L568423 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ Von der Null?
L568422 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Yes, von der Null.
L568421 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ Von der Null?
L568420 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Tell me about von der Null.
L568419 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
L568418 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ No!
L568417 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ have no idea what ordinary people thought.
L568416 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ You know something? You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity. What do you imagine people thought? The Berlin Philharmonic's taken over by Doctor Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate? Is that what you believed ordinary people thought?
L568415 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor.
L568414 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
L568413 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ Then you are wrong.
L568412 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.
L568411 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ You won't find it because no such telegram exists.
L568408 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ I don't have to think carefully. This is utterly ridiculous.
L568407 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President.
L568406 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.
L568405 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
L568404 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ I have no idea what you're talking about.
L568403 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ 'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
L568402 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ What telegram?
L568401 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?
L568400 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.
L568399 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
L568398 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
L568397 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ And what was that?
L568396 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ When I last saw you, I was unprepared. I did not know what to expect. In these past weeks, I have been thinking more carefully and making some notes.  You have to understand who I am and what I am. I am a musician and I believe in music. I am an artist and I believe in art. Art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. I must confess, however, to being extremely naive.  I insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics. My entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because I thought that I could, through music, do something practical.
L568395 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Go ahead, be my guest.
L568394 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ I wish to say something.
L568393 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ If it's too hot, open your tie.
L568387 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you.
L568386 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again.
L568250 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Oh boy, you're gonna love this. Take your time with this now. Those files contain the details of every working artist in this country. Those files are gonna tell us who joined the Party, who informed and who was helpful.
L568249 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.
L568248 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ What did Goering say?
L568247 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
L568246 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Who warned you?
L568245 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ I was warned.
L568244 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ How?
L568243 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ I wasn't told. I just knew it.
L568242 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Who?
L568241 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
L568240 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
L568239 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
L568238 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwängler, do you know Hans Hinkel?
L568232 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ I've had enough of this, I'm leaving.
L568231 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Steve Arnold...
L568226 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ See, David? He can't answer the question. I'll ask it again, Wilhelm, and don't give me any more airy-fairy, intellectual bullshit!
L568225 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?
L568224 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ I have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt...
L568222 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ If you are going to bully me like this, Major, you had better do your homework. You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.
L568221 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
L568220 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
L568219 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
L568218 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
L568217 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
L568216 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ You didn't complain about the racial policies, just about the musical standards, is that right?
L568215 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
L568214 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Why were they going to arrest you?
L568213 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
L568212 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
L568211 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
L568210 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Tough, tough!
L568209 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
L568208 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Your guess is as good as mine.
L568207 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
L568206 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Sure.
L568205 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ May I ask a question?
L568204 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering? You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.
L568203 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Let me me help you, then. You picked up the phone and made a call -  'Hello, Adolf? Wilhelm speaking. Listen, old pal, there's a Jew-boy musician I want you to help. He needs a permit to get to Paris.'
L568202 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
L568201 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Did you call someone you knew?
L568200 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
L568199 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?
L568198 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ It's the truth.
L568197 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ I don't buy that.
L568196 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ I made no deal!
L568192 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ Could I have a glass of water, please? Please, Fraulein?
L568191 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ How come?
L568190 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.
L568189 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?
L568188 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
L568187 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?
L568184 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934.
L568183 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
L568182 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
L568181 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
L568180 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
L568179 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?
L568178 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ That is correct.
L568177 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwängler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
L568176 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
L568175 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that?
L568336 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ His private life?
L568335 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ And ask him about his private life.
L568334 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ Yes, yes you may notice that he cannot even bring himself to utter his name, he... he refers to him as K.
L568333 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ The Miracle Kid.
L568332 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtwängler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front.  But if you really want to get Furtwängler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.
L568331 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Who's he?
L568330 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwängler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
L568329 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Never heard of him, who is he?
L568328 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null.
L568327 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ No. But that's why we hated him. We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us. He didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. He got everything from them, everything. He was filthier than any of us Party members.
L568326 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that?
L568325 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.
L568324 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.
L568323 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ One of my people?
L568322 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ One of your people told me.
L568321 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ He did?
L568320 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ Furtwängler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
L568319 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Yeah?
L568318 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ I've remembered something else...
L568317 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.
L568316 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite.
L568315 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Fuck that, Helmuth. You want to discuss symbols here?  This guy was a front man. He was the piper, but he played their tune, you get my philosophical meaning?  I'm not interested in small fish, I'm after Moby Dick. Come on, Helmuth. Hard facts.
L568314 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
L568313 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.
L568309 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - 
L568308 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
L568307 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.
L568306 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Was a member of...?  Speak up?
L568300 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
L568299 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ What?
L568298 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
L568297 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ You usually don't work on Sunday, Major?
L568296 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ So. You wanted to see me.
L568295 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.
L568293 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our secret.
L568292 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
L568291 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
L568288 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Do it, Helmuth.
L568287 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
L568286 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
L568285 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ Show you?
L568284 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Show me.
L568283 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ How could I forget?
L568282 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ Yes, you remember.
L568281 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
L568280 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ It's Dr. Furtwängler's baton, which I stole.
L568279 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
L568278 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
L568277 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Helmuth.
L568276 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ Major.
L568163 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ How could I know what's in the archive?
L568162 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Do you know what's in this archive?
L568161 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
L568160 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ Hans Hinkel was in the Ministry of Culture; how could I know such a man?  I
L568159 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
L568158 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ Do I know Hans Hinkel?
L568157 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ That's what I asked.
L568156 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ Do I know Hans Hinkel?
L568155 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Do you know Hans Hinkel?
L568154 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th.
L568145 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ Excuse me. Did you know that he refused to give the Nazi salute when Hitler was present in the audience?
L568144 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.
L568143 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ Is it true you're going to interview Dr. Furtwängler today?
L568141 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ Me? Never.  Never.
L568140 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party.
L568139 +++$+++ u8086 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ RODE +++$+++ It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
L568138 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
L568091 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ When you got to the crescendo.
L568090 +++$+++ u8087 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ SCHLEE +++$+++ I don't know what you mean, Major.
L568089 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Was looking at Furtwängler like that?
L568088 +++$+++ u8087 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ SCHLEE +++$+++ Yes.
L568087 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.
L568085 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Politics and art must be kept separate. I'll remember that. But let me see if you can help me with something I just don't understand. I'd really like to know why all you guys are so crazy about him. What's his secret?
L568084 +++$+++ u8087 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ SCHLEE +++$+++ Yes, Dr. Furtwängler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
L568083 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Oh! The evening before, I see...
L568080 +++$+++ u8087 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ SCHLEE +++$+++ He was forced to do that. But he refused to give the Nazi salute in front of Hitler. He kept his baton in his hand, you can't salute with a baton in your hand.
L568079 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
L568078 +++$+++ u8087 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ SCHLEE +++$+++ Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. Furtwängler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. Furtwängler.
L567994 +++$+++ u8089 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ Well, he's more than just a bandleader, Steve. He's a great conductor, a gifted artist. But we believe that he sold himself to the devil. Your number one priority from this moment on is to connect him to the Nazi Party. Don't be impressed by him. I want the folks back home to understand why we fought this war. Find Wilhelm Furtwängler guilty. He represents everything that was rotten in Germany.
L567993 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Like this bandleader.
L567992 +++$+++ u8089 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
L567991 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ They said I was dogged?
L567990 +++$+++ u8089 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ Conscientious, determined, dogged.
L567989 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Right. Claims assessor.
L567988 +++$+++ u8089 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ You were in insurance before the war.
L567987 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Jeez, and I never heard of him.
L567986 +++$+++ u8089 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.
L567985 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Sure.
L567984 +++$+++ u8089 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
L567983 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Nope.
L567982 +++$+++ u8089 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ So, you never heard of him.
L568071 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Do you really think it was brave? Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand?
L568070 +++$+++ u8090 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ WERNER +++$+++ It was Beethoven's Ninth.
L568069 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
L568068 +++$+++ u8090 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ WERNER +++$+++ Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
L568067 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?
L568066 +++$+++ u8090 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ WERNER +++$+++ It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwängler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
L568065 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
L568064 +++$+++ u8090 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ WERNER +++$+++ Dr. Furtwängler is a great musician. He actively opposed the Nazis and later on he helped many Jews to escape.
L568060 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
L568059 +++$+++ u8090 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ WERNER +++$+++ No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician -
L568058 +++$+++ u8090 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ WERNER +++$+++ Absolutely not.
L568057 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
L568056 +++$+++ u8090 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ WERNER +++$+++ First oboe.
L568055 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section since 1936. What instrument did you play?
L570816 +++$+++ u8096 +++$+++ m549 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I won't let the fat kid down.
L570815 +++$+++ u8091 +++$+++ m549 +++$+++ BREEN +++$+++ Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out.
