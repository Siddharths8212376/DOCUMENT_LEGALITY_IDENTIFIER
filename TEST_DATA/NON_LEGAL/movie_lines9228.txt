L353047 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
L353046 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
L353045 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
L353044 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
L353043 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ To what?
L353042 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ We can't. We're going back.
L353041 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
L353040 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
L353012 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ You're wrong!! It has to be!! It Just has to be!!
L353011 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.
L353010 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
L353009 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ You want there to be one... that doesn't...
L353008 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ There's a Sanctuary... there is!
L353004 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ One in a million, I suppose
L353003 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
L353002 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
L352939 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ It could be...
L352938 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
L352934 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ "Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
L352933 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
L352930 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Yes, do you think that's why he looks so sad?
L352929 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I have never seen a face like that before. It must be the look of great age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.
L352928 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Then the answer's yes...
L352927 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Of course.
L352926 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ ...But I still have the choice...?
L352925 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ You know, Jessica.
L352924 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
L352923 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
L352922 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ What does it mean?
L352920 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
L352919 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
L352918 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back.
L352917 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.
L352916 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Do you think he was telling the Truth?
L352915 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ It all seemed to make sense until Box.
L352914 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I won't.
L352913 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Don't ever let go.
L352912 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I doubt it.
L352911 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
L352909 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
L352908 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
L352906 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
L352905 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Don't!
L352904 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ We'll be all right...  We will...
L352903 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I hate outside! I hate it!
L352901 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ And yours.
L352900 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
L352899 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ What's that?
L352841 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ For us.
L352840 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
L352839 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
L352838 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
L352837 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
L352836 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
L352835 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ You're really one of us now, aren't you?
L352834 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ It doesn't make any difference anymore.
L352833 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?
L352831 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.
L352830 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I'm afraid.
L352826 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Ycch.  To kill things and then eat them. It must have been a savage world.
L352825 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything...  ...to eat, of course.
L352824 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ What do you suppose this was...?
L352823 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ It's the only way.
L352822 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ How do we know this is the right way?
L352815 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
L352814 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Will you take me with you?
L352783 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ They're watching us now. They'll let us in when they're sure.
L352782 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ How will they know we're coming?
L352781 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.
L352779 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ We'll convince them.
L352778 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,
L352777 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ They won't listen.
L352776 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
L352775 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ They won't believe us.
L352774 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others.  You know there's only one place to go now...
L352773 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ He's good, isn't he?
L352772 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
L352771 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
L352770 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Are you taking me to them?
L352706 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ No. Not that either.
L352705 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
L352704 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I -- I can't.
L352703 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
L352702 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
L352701 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
L352700 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
L352699 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
L352698 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
L352654 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Muscle? I don't know that one.
L352653 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
L352652 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ But what is this -- why?
L352651 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
L352646 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Let's see -- how long has it been?
L352645 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?
L352644 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ When did you begin to question Lastday?
L352643 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I have.
L352642 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Uh-uh.
L352641 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
L352640 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
L352639 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Some people say children need human mothering.
L352638 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
L352637 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
L352636 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ They're like beasts. Wild.
L352634 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ That's nice.
L352633 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I'd rather be with you.
L352632 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Why not? Maybe she'll help me. You won't. You'd better stay here.
L352631 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ You're not going, are you?
L352630 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
L352627 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ We're coming to Arcade.  Shall we Relive together?
L352626 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ If you trusted me, you'd know.
L352625 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Of course --
L352624 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ If you did know, you'd tell me.
L352623 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I wish I knew what you think I know.
L352622 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Maybe you'll think of something...
L352621 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I wish I could help you.
L352620 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ That's tomorrow.
L352619 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ What're you going to do?
L352618 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ What do you need?
L352617 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Are you here to help me?
L352594 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ And I never heard of Sanctuary.
L352593 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
L352592 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I don't have much time.
L352591 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Please? What friends?
L352590 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...
L352589 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I don't..
L352588 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I let him go... believe me.
L352587 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ And then you killed him, right?
L352586 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ A Runner gave it to me.
L352585 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Where did you get that?
L352584 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ How can I?
L352583 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ It's different now. Help me.
L352582 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
L352581 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Both... running's what I'm interested in.
L352580 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ About running, dying what?
L352579 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ You know something.
L352578 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Why tell me?
L352577 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I'm going to run.
L352576 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Why show me?
L352575 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ All right.
L352574 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I don't believe you. There has to be more.
L352573 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ You know.
L352572 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
L352571 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Then it's still no.
L352570 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Of course.
L352569 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Thanks... but I have the choice.
L352568 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Maybe... sure...
L352567 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
L352566 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I couldn't get you out of my mind.
L352565 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Here I am.  Shall I come in?
L352564 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ But I wasn't sure you'd come.
L352563 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ You could have called me yourself.
L352510 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ You're sure you don't want to try?
L352509 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ K.
L352508 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What Quad do you live in?
L352507 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ You're years away... I don't know why you're thinking of these things, much less talking about them.  Want to try?
L352506 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Six. I go red next year.
L352505 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Are you a 5 or a 6? 
L352504 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I didn't say that I would run... I just...
L352503 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.
L352501 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.
L352500 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I suppose. But what if you want to live?
L352499 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --
L352498 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Why is it wrong to run?
L352497 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I'm not armed.  Well?
L352496 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I'm afraid to tell you.
L352495 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I'm listening.
L352494 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Not about that.
L352493 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Let's have sex.  I thought you were curious.
L352492 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ How a Sandman lives.
L352491 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ About what?
L352490 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Curious.
L352489 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ And now?
L352488 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I changed my mind.
L352487 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ And?
L352486 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I thought I had to do something.
L352485 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ But you put yourself on the circuit!
L352484 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ No.
L352483 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Later.
L352482 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ No.
L352481 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
L352480 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Jessica.
L352479 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ You felt sad. What's your name?
L352478 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
L352477 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
