L190004 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ We can get these people.  With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
L190003 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I know how DNA works, Erin --
L190002 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry.  Not only does it attack every organ of the body, it fucks with your DNA, too.  That means these people's genes, and the genes of their kids, and the genes of their grandkids --
L190001 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ -- who happens to know they poisoned people and lied about it.
L190000 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ -- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.
L189999 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Bullshit.
L189998 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It's not about working hard --
L189997 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Okay, so here's what I'll do.  I'll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll tell them we can't help them cause you don't feel like working that hard.
L189996 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Because I said no.  Look -- the only reason PG&E's even talking to us is cause this is a quiet little real estate dispute.  We add plaintiffs, and suddenly we're in the middle of a toxic tort -- with a statute problem -- against a massive utility.  No, thank you.
L189995 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ That's crazy -- why not?
L189994 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.
L189971 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ And I realized, he's taking a chance too.
L189970 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Then I don't get anything either.
L189968 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Erin --
L189967 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?
L189966 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Erin --
L189965 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Boy, do I know how you feel.  First time I heard that number, I said you got to be kidding me.  Forty God damn percent?
L189923 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah.  Isn't that a shame?
L189922 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom.  They'll be driving around the valley for hours.
L189918 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What, you think I'm made of money?
L189917 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ And you can't?
L189916 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Because they can.  You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal.  They can afford to waste all the time in the world.
L189915 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I don't get why they'd do that.
L189914 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ That wasn't an offer.  A million would've been an offer.  When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you.
L189913 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ At least they made an offer.
L189895 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It sure as hell sounded like they were sitting up and taking notice.
L189894 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ So you think we got 'em scared?
L189893 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed that send button -- PG&E claims department is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting.
L189855 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Find out.
L189854 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
L189853 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ This is the only thing you found?
L189852 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ A ten percent raise and benefits.  But that's it.  I'm drawing the line.
L189851 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
L189850 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Okay.  A 5% raise, and --
L189849 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Look, Erin, this is not the way I do business, this extortion nonsense.
L189848 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I want a raise.  And benefits.  Including dental.
L189847 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Lemme see it, will you?
L189846 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Course I did.
L189845 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?
L189844 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh?  And <u>you</u> fired <u>me</u>.  Jesus.
L189843 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I didn't see any medical records in there.
L189842 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?
L189841 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What medical records?
L189840 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
L189839 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So what made you think it was?
L189838 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
L189837 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But, PG&E told her about the chromium?
L189835 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ You wanna know, you gotta hire me back.  I got a lot of bills to pay.
L189834 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So what's the story on this thing?  This cancer stuff?
L189833 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Boy, are you ever a shitty judge of people.
L189832 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
L189831 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
L189830 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just assumed you were off having fun.
L189829 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
L189828 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
L189827 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Oh, yeah?
L189826 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
L189825 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L189792 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Bullshit.  You're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed.  Fuck if I'll help you do that.
L189791 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Come on, I'm trying to help here.
L189790 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Don't bother.
L189789 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Okay, enough --  Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, I don't think this is the right place for you. So what I'm gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf.  Find you something else, okay?
L189784 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ That's not how we work here.  You don't just leave a message and take off.
L189783 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
L189782 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Erin, you've been gone for a week.
L189613 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I guess I'm not the right kind.
L189612 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
L189611 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Excuse me?
L189610 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You're a girl.
L189609 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Good.
L189608 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
L189607 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You do know how to do that, don't you?
L189605 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh.  Huh.  Well, look, I got this file I need valued. Real estate thing.  A lady has some property next to a PG&E plant that PG&E wants to buy. I need to know what to ask for it.
L189604 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Out to lunch with the girls.
L189603 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Where's Anna?
L189602 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Give her a cold washcloth to suck on --  I gotta go -- there's a clean one in that bag -- I'll check back in a bit.  Sorry.  My kid --
L189576 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Bullshit, you don't.
L189575 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
L189574 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ All I have is hundreds.
L189572 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.
L189571 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.
L189570 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.
L189569 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah?
L189561 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
L189560 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does.  Send in a r»sum», make an --
L189557 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me.
L189556 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
L189555 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ You said things would be fine, and they're not.
L189554 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I never lied.  I may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but --
L189553 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ There's two things I can't stand, Mr. Masry. Being ignored, and being lied to.  You did both.
L189552 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You did?  Wow, sorry about that.  Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He seems to think that you said --
L189551 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ You never called me back.  I left messages.
L189515 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Yeah?  Well, fuck you.  Sorry doesn't feed my kids.
L189514 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'm sorry, Erin.
L189513 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ <u>Settle down</u>?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry!  I can't <u>afford</u> to settle down!
L189512 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
L189511 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Bullshit.  You told me I'd get half a million dollars.  You told me I'd be set.
L189510 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I told you the questions might get a little personal --
L189509 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
L189508 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ If you hadn't used profanity --
L189507 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
L189492 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah.  I know.
L189491 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ ... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know?
L189490 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ ... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.
L189489 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ ... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
L189488 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now.
L190295 +++$+++ u5086 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ POTTER +++$+++ I think we should makes some changes.
L190294 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Right.
L190293 +++$+++ u5086 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ POTTER +++$+++ I've also been thinking about the team. Responsibilities, who should cover what --
L190266 +++$+++ u5086 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ POTTER +++$+++ Good.
L190265 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Corey.
L190264 +++$+++ u5086 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ POTTER +++$+++ Who's the judge?
L190261 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Sixty-nine.  We've got good answers to all of 'em.
L190260 +++$+++ u5086 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ POTTER +++$+++ How many counts?
L190257 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yesterday.
L190256 +++$+++ u5086 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ POTTER +++$+++ When'd they file the demur?
L190469 +++$+++ u5075 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ EMBRY +++$+++ At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college.  I can't afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was being honorable.  But there's nothing honorable in what I did.  Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
L190468 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
L190467 +++$+++ u5075 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ EMBRY +++$+++ Well.  There were a few documents that I somehow didn't get around to shredding.  That I kept instead.
L190466 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ What do you mean?
L190465 +++$+++ u5075 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ EMBRY +++$+++ Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good employee.
L190464 +++$+++ u5075 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ EMBRY +++$+++ That's right.
L190463 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ And you were told to destroy those?
L190462 +++$+++ u5075 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ EMBRY +++$+++ There was a lot of dull stuff -- vacation schedules, the like.  But then there were a few memos about the holding ponds.  The water in them.  They had readings from test wells, stuff like that.
L190461 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ And ...?
L190460 +++$+++ u5075 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ EMBRY +++$+++ Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.
L190459 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
L190458 +++$+++ u5075 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ EMBRY +++$+++ Nope.  And I didn't ask.
L190457 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Did he say why?
L190456 +++$+++ u5075 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ EMBRY +++$+++ I was working in the compressor, and out of nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the office and says, we're gonna give you a shredder machine, and send you on down to the warehouse.  We want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there.
L190055 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ The fuck you don't.  No one calls me Pattee. That heavy-breathing sicko that called the other night could've only found out about me from you.  People are dying, Ross.  You got document after document here, right under your nose, that says why, and you haven't said word one about it.  I wanna know how the hell you sleep at night.
L190054 +++$+++ u5088 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.
L190053 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Hey, Ross.  Tell me something.  Does PG&E pay you to cover their ass, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
L189872 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Ross -- you are an absolute angel.
L189871 +++$+++ u5088 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ You know what, Erin?  I got nothing but time here.  Why don't you let me do that for you, and you can get your kids some dinner.
L189761 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Not anymore.
L189760 +++$+++ u5088 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ You're married.
L189759 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Nope.  Maiden.
L189758 +++$+++ u5088 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Pattee?  That your middle name?
L189757 +++$+++ u5088 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Heck, yeah.  Come on back.  Just gonna need you to sign in here --
L189756 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?
L189755 +++$+++ u5088 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
L189754 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I guess I did.
L189753 +++$+++ u5088 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ You come to the right place.
L189752 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
L189751 +++$+++ u5088 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Erin.  Cool.  What can I do for you, Erin?
L189750 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Ross.  Real pleased to meet you.  I'm Erin.
L189749 +++$+++ u5088 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Ross.
L189748 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
L189747 +++$+++ u5088 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.
L189744 +++$+++ u5077 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ FRANKEL +++$+++ Good luck.  Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if I were you ...
L189743 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ County water board.  All righty, thanks.
L189742 +++$+++ u5077 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ FRANKEL +++$+++ Every county has one.  They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction.  You should be able to find something there.
L189741 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Hunh-uh.  What's that?
L189740 +++$+++ u5077 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ FRANKEL +++$+++ Have you been to the water board?
L189739 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
L189738 +++$+++ u5077 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ FRANKEL +++$+++ Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
L189737 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ So that stuff -- it kills people.
L189736 +++$+++ u5077 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ FRANKEL +++$+++ With repeated exposure to toxic levels -- God, anything, really -- respiratory disease, liver failure, heart failure, reproductive failure, chronic headaches, bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of course, any type of cancer.
L189735 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
L189734 +++$+++ u5077 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ FRANKEL +++$+++ Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
L189733 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ There's more than one kind?
L189732 +++$+++ u5077 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ FRANKEL +++$+++ What kind of chromium is it?
L190186 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ George!
L190185 +++$+++ u5080 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ KATIE +++$+++ I don't know.
L190184 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ What are you <u>doing</u>?  Where's George?
L189948 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ That's not true; we had dinner together just last night.
L189947 +++$+++ u5080 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ KATIE +++$+++ It happens all the time.
L189946 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Look, I know you're mad.  But the way this job is, things come up at the last minute, real important things, and I gotta deal with them.  Now I don't like me missing dinner any more than you do, but we're all gonna have to get used to it, cause the fact is, it's gonna happen sometimes.
L189865 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet.
L189864 +++$+++ u5080 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ KATIE +++$+++ Yeah.  A real moron.
L189861 +++$+++ u5080 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ KATIE +++$+++ I'm gonna hate it.
L189860 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before.
L189859 +++$+++ u5080 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ KATIE +++$+++ I hate it too.  I hate this trip.
L189578 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.
L189577 +++$+++ u5080 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ KATIE +++$+++ Mommy, can I get a flower?
L189531 +++$+++ u5080 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ KATIE +++$+++ How come you're not eating?
L189530 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.
L190513 +++$+++ u5087 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ROSALIND +++$+++ Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.  Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it.  Does anyone know anything about these phones?
L190512 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?
L190471 +++$+++ u5087 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ROSALIND +++$+++ In the conference --
L190470 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Hey, Ros, where are they?
L190308 +++$+++ u5087 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ROSALIND +++$+++ Yup.  They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.
L190307 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ PG& -- Are you sure?
L190306 +++$+++ u5087 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ROSALIND +++$+++ Some meeting.  With PG&E people.
L190305 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ What's going on in there?
L190304 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ So did I.
L190303 +++$+++ u5087 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ROSALIND +++$+++ Hey, Erin, I thought you were taking a sick day.
L189927 +++$+++ u5087 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ROSALIND +++$+++ Hey, just so long as you see Him.
L189926 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".
L189925 +++$+++ u5087 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ROSALIND +++$+++ You've been reading for hours.
L189659 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich. From the file room?  I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.
L189658 +++$+++ u5087 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ROSALIND +++$+++ Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?
L190443 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
L190442 +++$+++ u5083 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ How come her own mom isn't helping her?
L190441 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
L190440 +++$+++ u5083 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ She's one of the sick people?
L190344 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Oh, God, sweetheart, no.  There's nothing on Earth I love more than you.  Nothing.  I promise.
L190343 +++$+++ u5083 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
L190342 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
