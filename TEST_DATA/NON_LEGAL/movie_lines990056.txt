L332160 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ "Thunder lizard!"
L332159 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ It's okay to call them brontosaurs, Tim.  It's a great name.  It's a romantic name.  It means "thunder lizard".
L332107 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Maybe -- it's hard to say.
L332106 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ I doubt it.
L332105 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --
L332104 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ That's a good idea.
L332103 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ 'Course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help.
L332100 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
L332099 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ So am I going to help you with your foot?
L332098 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
L332097 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
L332096 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ No.
L332095 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?

L332093 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
L332092 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
L332091 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ I threw up.
L332057 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Tim, I'll come back for you.  I'll get Lex out first.
L332056 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!

L331809 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Because they sure don't look like birds to me.  I heard a meteor hit the earth and made like this one hundred mile crater someplace down in Mexico - -

L332047 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ What?  What can we do?
L332046 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ We gotta do something.
L332045 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Oh my God!
L332039 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Relatively.

L332012 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Fine.
L332011 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I know.
L332010 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I didn't say you were scared.
L332009 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I didn't say I was scared.
L332008 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.
L332007 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Kids get scared.
L332006 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
L332005 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ The kids okay?
L332004 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Their radio's out too.  Gennaro said to stay put.

L331981 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.

L331674 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Not without massive sequence gaps!

L331628 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Try to!
L331627 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ So you two dig up dinosaurs?
L332373 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
L332372 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
L331789 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ What does he mean by "target audience"?
L331788 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.
L331787 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Who?
L331786 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Ah - - they're here.
L331755 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Do they show intelligence?  With the brain cavity like theirs we assumed - -
L331754 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Yes, yes, yes, which is why we take extreme precautions. They viewing area below us will have eight-inch tempered glass set in reinforced steel frames to - -
L331750 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Alan Grant.  Tell me, what kind of metabolism do they have?  What's their growth rate?  rate of growth.
L331749 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Robert.  Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.  Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.
L331717 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Wu?
L331716 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Blood temperature feels like high eighties.
L331696 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Let's get outta here!
L331695 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
L331694 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Can't you stop these things?!
L331657 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ We clocked the T-rex at thirty-two miles an hour.
L331656 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ - - and you're going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and get around like that?!  Like that!?  This is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness.
L331655 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
L331654 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
L331612 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ For a further three years.
L331611 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ - - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
L331610 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
L331609 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ No, I'm sorry, that  wouldn't be possible.  We've just discovered a new skeleton, and - -
L331608 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Well, it's - - right up your alley.  Look, why don't you both  come on down for the weekend.  Love to have the opinion of a paleobotoanist as well.  I've got a jet standing by at Choteau. 
L331605 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Not to put a fine point on it, your kind.  Let's face it, in your particular field, you're the top minds.  If I could just get you two to sign off on the park - - you know, give a wee testimonial - - I could get back on schedule - -  - -schedule.
L331604 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ What kind of opinions?
L331603 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
L331602 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
L331601 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?
L331589 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ John Hammond.  And I am delighted to finally meet you in person Dr Grant.
L331588 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ And who in God's name do you think you are....?
L331587 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ For today, I guarantee it.
L331586 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Hey, we were saving that!
L332366 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Phone security systems, everything works.  You ask for it, we got it!
L332365 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ What works?
L332346 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Yes.
L332345 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I am gonna have to find the others and get you to a doctor.  Will you look after Tim, Lex?
L332337 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I'm coming up there Tim! I'm coming to get you!  Lex, I've got to get him!
L332336 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!
L332335 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
L332334 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!
L332333 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Shhhh.  Tim, I'm right here below you.  Easy catch. One, two, three.  You count it yourself.  One, two, three - -
L332328 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Timmy!  Do as he says!  Timmy!  Do as Dr. Grant says, quick!
L332327 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to three.  I'll catch you.
L332326 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Do as he says!  The power's coming back, Timmy!
L332318 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Timmy!  The power is coming down, quick!
L332317 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ C'mon Tim, move down, damn it!
L332270 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Okay.  Keep low.  Follow me.
L332269 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Let's go!
L332268 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Bet you'll never look at birds the same way again!
L332267 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Please!
L332266 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Watch how it eats!
L332218 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  Malcolm was right!  Look, life found a way!
L332217 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ What's that?
L332203 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ You're a beautiful big animal.
L332202 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ I like cows.
L332195 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ It's okay!  It's okay!  It's a brachiosaur!
L332194 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Go away!
L332181 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ All night.
L332180 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ All night?
L332179 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I'll stay awake.
L332178 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ What if the dinosaur comes back while we're all asleep?
L332172 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I guess we'll just have to evolve too.
L332171 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ What are you gonna do now if you don't have to dig of dinosaur bones any more?
L332168 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Dorkatops!
L332167 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ They're just doing what they do.  Well the other kind - -  - - just do what they do.
L332166 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Oh, I hate the other kind.
L332165 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Tim, Tim, Tim....
L332153 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.
L332152 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Hear that?  Are you hearing this?
L332114 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Alright.
L332113 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
L332112 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ It's safe.
L332111 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ It's safe.
L332110 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ It's safe?
L332109 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I'm trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain, you know!
L332108 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Liar!  You said you wouldn't leave!
L332089 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ That's not what I'm going to do.  Good!
L332088 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ He left us!  He left us!
L332087 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Shhh - - I'm right here, Lex.  I'm going to look after you.  I'm going to help your brother.  I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?
L332086 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Dad - - Dad - -
L332059 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Let's get you out.
L332058 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ He's knocked out!  He's knocked out!  Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!  Daddy, daddy!
L332053 +++$+++ u6168 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!
L332052 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Tim!  Lex!
L332255 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Wait a minute?  What do you mean "worked"?  Everything is still off!
L332254 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ That will teach you to trust Grandpa.
L332244 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ You're all right, John You're okay.  It's just you don't have intelligence.  You have "thinktelligence."  You think narrowly and call it "being focused."  You don't see the consequences.  You're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions.
L332243 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I think perhaps I'll just sit down.  I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?
L331779 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!
L331778 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
L331777 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
L331776 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
L331775 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
L331774 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
L331772 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?  Genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet.  But you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun.
L331771 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Alright Donald, alright, but just let him talk.  I want to hear all viewpoints.  I truly do.  I truly am.
L331723 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.
L331722 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Your silence intrigues me.
L331637 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
L331636 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Don't do that!
L331635 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ John, John.
L331634 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, that¹s all it is!
L331633 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I certainly have!  Very clearly!  Because of the behavior of the system in phase space!
L331632 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
L331631 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
L331630 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!
L331629 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
L331844 +++$+++ u6171 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ NEDRY +++$+++ Thanks, Dad.
L331843 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
L331842 +++$+++ u6171 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ NEDRY +++$+++ I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
L331841 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
L331840 +++$+++ u6171 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ NEDRY +++$+++ You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
L331839 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
L331838 +++$+++ u6171 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ NEDRY +++$+++ I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.
L332079 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ Sure.
L332078 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
L332070 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ There's no sign of him anywhere.
L332069 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Well?
L331915 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ Thanks, Steve.
L331914 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Tell them when they get back to the cars.
L331913 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ Sustain winds 45 knots.
L331820 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Ray, start the tour program.
L331819 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
L331818 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Why didn't I build in Orlando?
L332332 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.
