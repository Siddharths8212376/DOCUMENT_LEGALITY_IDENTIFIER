L149984 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ I hate it too.
L149983 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
L149982 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Oh sis. You're so tense.
L149981 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
L149980 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ I'm at your service.
L149978 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ But who will they turn to for help?
L149977 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
L149976 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ What's your plan of attack?
L149975 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
L149974 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
L149973 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
L149972 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.
L149971 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ No.
L149970 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
L149969 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Interesting.
L149968 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
L149967 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ What's wrong with you?
L149959 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Shhh.
L149958 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ You would not believe what--
L149826 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Okay.
L149825 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Call me later.
L149824 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Blow me.
L149823 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Loser.
L149822 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ I'm working on it.
L149821 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Fuck her yet?
L149678 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ It would feel so yummy.
L149677 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Even there?
L149676 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ You can put it anywhere.
L149674 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Because I'm the only person you can't control and it kills you.
L149673 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
L149672 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
L149671 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Be more specific.
L149670 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.
L149669 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ And if I win?
L149668 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
L149667 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ What are the terms?
L149665 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Could you be more desperate to read it?
L149664 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
L149663 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art.
L149662 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ I'll think about it...
L149661 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Care to make a wager on that?
L149660 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
L149659 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.
L149658 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
L149657 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
L149656 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Jesus Christ, is she for real?
L149655 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Shut up and turn to page 64.
L149654 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
L149653 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.
L149652 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
L149651 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
L149650 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Why not?
L149648 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ She's quite cute you know. Young supple breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie.
L149647 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Sounds intriguing.
L149646 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
L149645 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ I see your point... though why should I care?
L149644 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.
L149643 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court?
L149642 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
L149641 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
L149640 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ I don't find this very funny,
L149638 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ You don't mean?
L149637 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
L149636 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Sorry.
L149629 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ What?
L149628 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
L149626 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.
L149625 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual?
L149624 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
L149623 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
L149613 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Outstanding.
L149612 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
L150038 +++$+++ u4711 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. CALDWELL +++$+++ It's the least I can do.
L150037 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Oh please. I can't have you do that.
L150036 +++$+++ u4711 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. CALDWELL +++$+++ Let me get that for you.
L150033 +++$+++ u4711 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. CALDWELL +++$+++ Absolutely.
L150032 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ You will be discreet about this?
L150031 +++$+++ u4711 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. CALDWELL +++$+++ I can't thank you enough.
L150029 +++$+++ u4711 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. CALDWELL +++$+++ Black.
L150028 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ I know. She's so young and he's so -
L150027 +++$+++ u4711 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. CALDWELL +++$+++ Ronald? That's crazy.
L150026 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
L150025 +++$+++ u4711 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. CALDWELL +++$+++ Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
L150024 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
L150023 +++$+++ u4711 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. CALDWELL +++$+++ What about her?
L150022 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ It's Cecile.
L150021 +++$+++ u4711 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. CALDWELL +++$+++ Not at all. What's wrong?
L150020 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ I hope I didn't keep you from something.
L150019 +++$+++ u4711 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. CALDWELL +++$+++ I got your message and came as quick as I could.
L149606 +++$+++ u4711 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. CALDWELL +++$+++ Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
L149605 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
L149602 +++$+++ u4711 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. CALDWELL +++$+++ That's beautiful.
L149601 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I...  turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works.
L149600 +++$+++ u4711 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. CALDWELL +++$+++ How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
L149599 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ You're too kind.
L149596 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ I'll do my best.
L149595 +++$+++ u4711 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. CALDWELL +++$+++ I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
L150053 +++$+++ u4716 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ I guess that puts me in my place. Thank you for the hospitality Mrs. Caldwell. It was a true awakening.
L150052 +++$+++ u4711 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. CALDWELL +++$+++ Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
L150051 +++$+++ u4716 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.
L150050 +++$+++ u4711 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. CALDWELL +++$+++ Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?!
L150049 +++$+++ u4716 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.
L150044 +++$+++ u4711 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. CALDWELL +++$+++ Is that so?
L150043 +++$+++ u4716 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
L150042 +++$+++ u4711 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. CALDWELL +++$+++ I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
L150041 +++$+++ u4716 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Excuse me.
L150040 +++$+++ u4711 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. CALDWELL +++$+++ Who the hell do you think you are?!
L150432 +++$+++ u4712 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. O'SHEA +++$+++ I understand. Good night.
L150431 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ It's really important.
L150430 +++$+++ u4712 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. O'SHEA +++$+++ I'll do that.
L150429 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
L150428 +++$+++ u4712 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. O'SHEA +++$+++ Young man, I already told you she's not here.
L150427 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Annette! Annette!
L150426 +++$+++ u4712 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. O'SHEA +++$+++ Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
L150425 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Do you know when she'll be back?
L150424 +++$+++ u4712 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. O'SHEA +++$+++ She's out.
L150423 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Do you know where she is?
L150422 +++$+++ u4712 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. O'SHEA +++$+++ She's not here.
L150421 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ I need to talk to Annette.
L150420 +++$+++ u4712 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. O'SHEA +++$+++ What do you want?
L150418 +++$+++ u4712 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. O'SHEA +++$+++ I'll do that.
L150417 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Well please leave a message that I called.
L150416 +++$+++ u4712 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. O'SHEA +++$+++ I've already told you, she's not home.
L150415 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ It's desperate that I talk to her.
L150356 +++$+++ u4712 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. O'SHEA +++$+++ You must be Sebastian. I've heard such nice things about you.
L150355 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Hi. Is Annette at home?
L150132 +++$+++ u4713 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. SUGERMAN +++$+++ Oh... no thank you...
L150131 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ I said, do you want some water?
L150130 +++$+++ u4713 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. SUGERMAN +++$+++ Excuse me?
L150129 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
L150128 +++$+++ u4713 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. SUGERMAN +++$+++ I did?
L150127 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Uh huh. You beat me three times.
L150126 +++$+++ u4713 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. SUGERMAN +++$+++ We played backgammon?
L150125 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Right after we played backgammon.
L150124 +++$+++ u4713 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. SUGERMAN +++$+++ I did?
L150123 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Yes, you already did.
L150122 +++$+++ u4713 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ MRS. SUGERMAN +++$+++ Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -
L150465 +++$+++ u4714 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ NIGHT DOORMAN +++$+++ Don't worry about it.
L150464 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
L150463 +++$+++ u4714 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ NIGHT DOORMAN +++$+++ I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
L150462 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Do you mind if I check upstairs?
L150461 +++$+++ u4714 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ NIGHT DOORMAN +++$+++ Nope.
L150460 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Did she show up?
L150459 +++$+++ u4714 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ NIGHT DOORMAN +++$+++ Eight o'clock. You got to go.
L150458 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ What time is it?
L150478 +++$+++ u4716 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ You bastard!
L150477 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Ronald, I'm sorry.
L150476 +++$+++ u4716 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Don't know what I'm talking about? I know that you fucked Cecile.
L150475 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
L150474 +++$+++ u4716 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Did you hit her?
L150473 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
L150472 +++$+++ u4716 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Kathryn. Did you hit her?
L150471 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L150470 +++$+++ u4716 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Where the hell do you come off hitting women?
L150469 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Can we do it later. I've had a really bad night and -
L150468 +++$+++ u4716 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
L150467 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Hey Ronald.
L150061 +++$+++ u4716 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ How will I get to her?
L150060 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her another letter.
L150057 +++$+++ u4716 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ She really loves me.
L150056 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ You're a lucky guy.
L150055 +++$+++ u4716 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.
L151064 +++$+++ u4724 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MISS CALLAHAN +++$+++ Once the emptiness in Amy's life is filled, the dream will go of itself. If a up to you, both of you. Only you two can bring her into a real world.. You must give her the friendship and love she craves.
L151063 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ How?
L151062 +++$+++ u4724 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MISS CALLAHAN +++$+++ It's perfectly normal for a child to dream. I can see how a sensitive little girl, finding this portrait, would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend. That image dwells only in her imagination, and that image can go as quickly as it was born.
L151056 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I can see it all...the very day it began. Amy was lonely; she was desperate for friendship. I remember the night she told me she had wished on her ring. That must have been the day she first wished for a friend.
L151055 +++$+++ u4724 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MISS CALLAHAN +++$+++ What do you mean?
L151054 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.
L151024 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It's been ages since I've even thought of a mummers' play. When I was in college we used to do them every year — St. George and the Dragon, all kinds of sword dances.
L151023 +++$+++ u4724 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MISS CALLAHAN +++$+++ It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
L151022 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I love the smell of pine.

L150972 +++$+++ u4724 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MISS CALLAHAN +++$+++ Does she go up to the Farren's often?
L150784 +++$+++ u4724 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MISS CALLAHAN +++$+++ But quite harmless, I'm sure.
L150783 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.

L150769 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Yes. As a matter of fact, I was on the point of telling you about it yesterday — about Oliver's first marriage — and his wife's death. It has so much to do with Amy — although he'll never realize it.
L150768 +++$+++ u4724 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MISS CALLAHAN +++$+++ I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
L150767 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ We don't even like them,  I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.  It was his first wife's favorite picture.  She was an artist.

L150761 +++$+++ u4724 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MISS CALLAHAN +++$+++ I know how it is.  My Dad collects miniature canon.
L150760 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Oliver's pet,  I'm sure it would be the first thing he'd grab if we ever had a fire.

L150555 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I'm so glad to have met you at last. You're just as nice as Amy told me you were.  I hope you'll come to see us.
L150524 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan.

L150969 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
L150968 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
L150913 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You can't open it yet. You have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
L150912 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Oh, thank you, darling.
L150858 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ All right, mommy.
