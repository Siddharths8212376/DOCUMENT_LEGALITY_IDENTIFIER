L588607 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
L588606 +++$+++ u3174 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. MACGRUDER +++$+++ They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back...
L588605 +++$+++ u3174 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. MACGRUDER +++$+++ What? Oh, yes, certainly.
L588604 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Have you got a pencil?
L588603 +++$+++ u3174 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. MACGRUDER +++$+++ I have no idea.
L588602 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ That... that... who was that?
L588575 +++$+++ u3174 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. MACGRUDER +++$+++ Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
L588574 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ There we are!
L588534 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Well, all right, but...
L588533 +++$+++ u3174 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. MACGRUDER +++$+++ I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
L588532 +++$+++ u3174 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. MACGRUDER +++$+++ Oh. Oh, well, all right.
L588531 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. 
L588530 +++$+++ u3174 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. MACGRUDER +++$+++ Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
L588529 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Yes.
L588528 +++$+++ u3174 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. MACGRUDER +++$+++ Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
L588527 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ And he'll talk?
L588526 +++$+++ u3174 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. MACGRUDER +++$+++ Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
L588525 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
L588524 +++$+++ u3174 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. MACGRUDER +++$+++ I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
L588523 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ You said three o'clock.
L588522 +++$+++ u3174 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. MACGRUDER +++$+++ I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels.  You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
L588520 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ What do you suppose it is?
L588519 +++$+++ u3174 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. MACGRUDER +++$+++ Hello, Miss Daniels.
L588518 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever seen so many gulls?
L589414 +++$+++ u3173 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. BUNDY +++$+++ Yes. I have never known birds of different species to flock together. The very concept is unimaginable.  Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance. How could we possible hope to fight them?
L589413 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Maybe! Is it impossible?
L589412 +++$+++ u3173 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. BUNDY +++$+++ And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?
L589389 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I don't know anything about birds except that they're attacking this town.
L589388 +++$+++ u3173 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. BUNDY +++$+++ Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
L589387 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
L589386 +++$+++ u3173 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. BUNDY +++$+++ I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
L589385 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
L589370 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ No one called it a war!
L589369 +++$+++ u3173 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. BUNDY +++$+++ Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity?
L589368 +++$+++ u3173 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. BUNDY +++$+++ I thought not. Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx, Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago!
L589367 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I don't know why.
L589365 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ To...  To kill them.
L589364 +++$+++ u3173 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. BUNDY +++$+++ For what purpose?
L589363 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Daniels. I think they were after the children.
L589362 +++$+++ u3173 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. BUNDY +++$+++ What do you think they were after, Miss...?
L589361 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ What were the crows after at the school?
L589360 +++$+++ u3173 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. BUNDY +++$+++ The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this.
L589339 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ These weren't a few birds.
L589338 +++$+++ u3173 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. BUNDY +++$+++ I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
L589337 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Yes, all right, I'll wait for you. Good-by. 
L589325 +++$+++ u3173 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. BUNDY +++$+++ ...insist on making it difficult for life to survive on this planet. If it weren't for birds...
L589324 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Hello, may I speak to Mitch Brenner, please?  Yes, I'll wait.
L589322 +++$+++ u3173 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. BUNDY +++$+++ Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who...
L589321 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...
L589317 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Thank you.  Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
L589316 +++$+++ u3173 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. BUNDY +++$+++ They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
L589315 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ They're different, Daddy.  Thank you.  I think these were crows. Yes, hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked the children, attacked them.  Daddy, a little girl was sent to the hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all right, but you act as if I'm... all right, all right.  No, I can't come home now. I just can't, Daddy. How is it there? I mean... are there birds? In the sky? But no trouble. Well, I hope...  I don't know when. I simply can't leave now. Tell Mother not to worry. All right, Daddy, good-by.
L589314 +++$+++ u3173 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. BUNDY +++$+++ There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
L589313 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
L589496 +++$+++ u3172 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MITCH +++$+++ Can we go on living here otherwise?
L589495 +++$+++ u3176 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ SHOLES +++$+++ How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
L589490 +++$+++ u3172 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MITCH +++$+++ With smoke.
L589489 +++$+++ u3176 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ SHOLES +++$+++ How do you plan to do that?
L589486 +++$+++ u3172 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MITCH +++$+++ Mrs. Bundy, you said something about Santa Cruz. About seagulls getting lost in the fog, and heading in for the lights.
L589485 +++$+++ u3176 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ SHOLES +++$+++ How?
L589484 +++$+++ u3172 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MITCH +++$+++ I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
L589481 +++$+++ u3176 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ SHOLES +++$+++ If you don't even know what you want to do...
L589480 +++$+++ u3172 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MITCH +++$+++ I'm not sure, but...
L589479 +++$+++ u3176 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ SHOLES +++$+++ Help how? What do you want to do?
L589478 +++$+++ u3172 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MITCH +++$+++ Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
L589477 +++$+++ u3176 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ SHOLES +++$+++ I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought... 
L589476 +++$+++ u3172 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MITCH +++$+++ It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
L589475 +++$+++ u3176 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ SHOLES +++$+++ No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
L589474 +++$+++ u3172 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MITCH +++$+++ Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
L589473 +++$+++ u3176 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ SHOLES +++$+++ Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
L589466 +++$+++ u3172 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MITCH +++$+++ I think we're in trouble. I don't know how or why this started, but I know it's here and I know we'd be crazy to ignore it.
L589465 +++$+++ u3176 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ SHOLES +++$+++ No one ever said you were, Mitch.
L589464 +++$+++ u3172 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MITCH +++$+++ Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
L589457 +++$+++ u3173 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. BUNDY +++$+++ The point is that no one seemed to get upset about it. They were gone the next morning, just as if nothing at all had happened. Poor things.
L589456 +++$+++ u3175 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ SALESMAN +++$+++ They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
L589455 +++$+++ u3173 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. BUNDY +++$+++ That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
L589395 +++$+++ u3173 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. BUNDY +++$+++ ...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!
L589394 +++$+++ u3175 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ SALESMAN +++$+++ Kill them all. Get rid of them. Messy animals.
L589391 +++$+++ u3173 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. BUNDY +++$+++ That would hardly be possible.
L589390 +++$+++ u3175 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ SALESMAN +++$+++ Then fight back. Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth.
L589384 +++$+++ u3173 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. BUNDY +++$+++ They are incapable of organized warfare!
L589383 +++$+++ u3175 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ SALESMAN +++$+++ Not if they're starting a war.
L589382 +++$+++ u3173 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. BUNDY +++$+++ We need them.
L589381 +++$+++ u3175 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ SALESMAN +++$+++ Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
L589380 +++$+++ u3173 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. BUNDY +++$+++ Birds?
L589372 +++$+++ u3173 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. BUNDY +++$+++ You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying as much.
L589371 +++$+++ u3175 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ SALESMAN +++$+++ Scotch, light on the water.
L589406 +++$+++ u3173 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. BUNDY +++$+++ Of course it does. If we believe that birds are attacking, why... why next we'll believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of...
L589405 +++$+++ u3176 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ SHOLES +++$+++ Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
L589404 +++$+++ u3173 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. BUNDY +++$+++ Of course.
L589403 +++$+++ u3176 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ SHOLES +++$+++ Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.
L589345 +++$+++ u3173 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. BUNDY +++$+++ Probably herring gulls. They arrive in November, you know, and don't migrate North again until March or...
L589344 +++$+++ u3176 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ SHOLES +++$+++ The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
L589343 +++$+++ u3173 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MRS. BUNDY +++$+++ Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
L589342 +++$+++ u3176 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ SHOLES +++$+++ How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
L589459 +++$+++ u3175 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ SALESMAN +++$+++ All right, all right!  Hope you figure this out, folks.
L589458 +++$+++ u3177 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ I'm leaving! Are you coming?
L589454 +++$+++ u3177 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Can't you please finish your drink?
L589453 +++$+++ u3175 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ SALESMAN +++$+++ Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls.
L589450 +++$+++ u3175 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ SALESMAN +++$+++ Take it easy, lady.  There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
L589449 +++$+++ u3177 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today?  Are you coming?
L589437 +++$+++ u3177 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Put on your coats! Do you want to get trapped here?
L589436 +++$+++ u3175 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ SALESMAN +++$+++ I haven't finished my drink.
L589435 +++$+++ u3177 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Then let's go. Now!
L589434 +++$+++ u3175 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ SALESMAN +++$+++ I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
L589927 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Good morning.
L589926 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Oh, you'll have ample opportunity -- ample --  Good morning, Dr. Fettes.
L589879 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Good.
L589878 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ There, Master Fettes.  Sooner than we had expected.  A stoke of luck one might say.
L589875 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ How could I?  I will do my best. After all, you see, I am financially interested.
L589874 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ But can't you give me any idea?
L589873 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ I fear he may have to.
L589751 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --
L589750 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you --
L589749 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ That's right.  Gray, the cabman. I've had a bit of dealing with MacFarlane in the past, you know.
L589748 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Mr. Gray?
L589747 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
L589746 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I'm Donald Fettes.
L590139 +++$+++ u3185 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MARSH +++$+++ It is a pity.
L590138 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Even so, I could never think of going on -- I've got to find some other profession.
L590132 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ It's not the failure. I feel that MacFarlane has taught me nothing. He taught me the mathematics of anatomy but he couldn't teach me the poetry of medicine.
L590131 +++$+++ u3185 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MARSH +++$+++ It's not because of Georgina -- because of Dr. MacFarlane's failure?
L590125 +++$+++ u3185 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MARSH +++$+++ Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
L590124 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
L589830 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Ma'am, is you'll allow me, I'd like to give you cause for courage -- Dr. MacFarlane is a great man -- I think he's the greatest man in medicine.  God would not have given him such gifts if they were not meant for Georgina's cure.
L589829 +++$+++ u3185 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MARSH +++$+++ -- pain -- and shock.  She's brave enough, but I don't know about myself.  Now that it seems so close, I wonder if I dare trust my child into any but God's hands. Maybe He knows best.
L589828 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Yes.
L589827 +++$+++ u3185 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MARSH +++$+++ You have his promise, then?
L589771 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Of course I will.
L589770 +++$+++ u3185 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MARSH +++$+++ Ask this one favor --
L589769 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I didn't mean it that way.  I meant only that I am not in a position to ask favors.
L589768 +++$+++ u3185 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MARSH +++$+++ Did he tell you about Georgina?
L589767 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
L589766 +++$+++ u3185 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MARSH +++$+++ Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
L589765 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I'm only a student.
L589764 +++$+++ u3185 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MARSH +++$+++ I want you to help my little girl.
L589763 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ You asked to see me, ma'am?
L590152 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ And back with MacFarlane and all that he stands for the next day.
L590151 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
L590150 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
L590149 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
L590148 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
L590147 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Where can I find him?
L590146 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ He's not home.
L590079 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ It's a gift to my people -- and I see MacFarlane and Gray-- the pit yawns for them and the flames -- and I would have you away from them and safe out of the torment.--
L590078 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I've heard of it.
L590077 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
L590076 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ MacFarlane
L590075 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
L590074 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ They did not tell you how that porter cried out in the witness box when the Kings Counselor pressed him hard -- how he cried out that he was shielding a gentleman of consequence.
L590073 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Aye.
L590072 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
L590071 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.
L590070 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
L590069 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
L590068 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
L590067 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
L590066 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ I'm cold as ice.
L590065 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
L590064 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ He could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always Gray -- Gray to hound him to his death.
L590063 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ Is it a great man whom Gray can order to his bidding? Is it a great man who for very shame dare not acknowledge his own wife so that I must play maidservant for the world's sake and his success?
L590062 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ He's a great doctor -- a great man --
L590061 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
L590060 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
L590059 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ You must leave this house.
L590198 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Hold that lamp up -- I must see her face.
L590197 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ It was a woman when we put her in.
L590196 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ This is not a woman!
L590185 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
L590184 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Where shall we put it? In the back?
L590181 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Why not? I must have subjects. It's the only way I can teach. It's the only way you can learn. The stupidity of the people the idiocy of their laws will not stop no -- nor will they force me to deal with such reptilian creatures as Gray. We can do our own dirty work -- and we must.
L590180 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ No.
L590179 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows.  We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
L590178 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ You couldn't do that, Doctor.
L590177 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
L590176 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ You've no thought of going there?
L590175 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Tosh!  Fettes!  It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
L590174 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ They'll be thinking of that, too.
L590173 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
L590172 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
L590171 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ See that, Fettes?
L590165 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Gray -- I'm rid of him --
L590164 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ What?
L590163 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him --
L590162 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
L590161 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ What's that you say?
L590054 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Don't be a fool.  One can't begin and then stop -- and because that entry of the girl's body is in your hand, you'll do as I say. As for me, I'll tend to Gray.
L590053 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
L590052 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ What do you mean, Fettes?
L590051 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ No.
L590050 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Fettes, the more things are wrong, the more we must act as if everything were right. You must do with Joseph as you did with, the street singer -- complete dissection -- a proper entry in the book --
L589940 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Confound me, the child's a cripple, of course she wants to walk.  Child, I say to you get up out of that chair and walk.
L589939 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
L589938 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ You can't -- can't!  Stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses. Let the child stand and walk -- her spine's all right.  I know it's all right.
L589935 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ That's the way of it, Fettes.  You bring the lassie to me.
L589934 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.
L589933 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ That's only our duty, Fettes -- that's the end at which we aim with all this nasty business.
L589932 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
L589931 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
L589930 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I've just been to see Mrs. Marsh. Georgina is doing splendidly.  The incision has healed -- clean and fine -- but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk.
