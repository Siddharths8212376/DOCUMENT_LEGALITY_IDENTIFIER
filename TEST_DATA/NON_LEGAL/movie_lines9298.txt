L419453 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Must one always be after something?
L419452 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ What are you after?
L419451 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.
L419445 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ But my dear child, I am most at home among working men. I hate the places where you circulate -- the Hotel Clarence... This is my natural element. After all, what are any of us? Workingmen! At least, those of us who are worth our salt. Hyah?
L419444 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ This is a place for workmen.
L419443 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I always eat here.
L419442 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Then how did you get here?
L419441 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I didn't follow you.
L419440 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I don't like your following me.
L419439 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
L419413 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ So! You want to make a strike breaker out of me! I am surprised at you, Comrade! Is it too much for the workers of the world to ask you to walk around the corner for lunch? All I can say to you is take your hammer and sickle and get out of that Royal Suite!
L419412 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
L419411 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Room service speaking.
L419326 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died.
L419325 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ But, Ninotchka, I held you in my arms. You kissed me!
L419323 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Ninotchka, you can't walk out like this... I'm crazy about you, and I thought I'd made an impression on you. You liked the white of my eye.
L419322 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Then do it through my lawyer!
L419321 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ You know I want to...
L419320 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
L419319 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
L419318 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ As a representative of Moscow...
L419317 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
L419316 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I was sent here by my country to fight you.
L419315 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
L419314 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Let's forget that we ever met.
L419313 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
L419312 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I must go.
L419306 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ But one of your friends may be in need of you. You must answer.
L419305 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Oh, let it ring.
L419304 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ The telephone is ringing.
L419303 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Glorious, analytical...
L419302 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My impossible, unromantic, statistical...
L419301 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Thank you.
L419300 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ No, that was restful. Again.
L419299 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Was that talkative?
L419297 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ You analyze everything out of existence. You analyze me out of existence. I won't let you. Love is not so simple. Ninotchka, Ninotchka, why do doves bill and coo? Why do snails, coldest of all creatures, circle interminably around each other? Why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates? Why do flowers open their petals? Oh, Ninotchka, Ninotchka, surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion... a general warmth in the palms of your hands... a strange heaviness in your limbs... a burning of the lips that is not thirst but a thousand times more tantalizing, more exalting, than thirst?
L419296 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ It's false sentimentality.
L419295 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I can't possibly think of a better reason.
L419294 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
L419293 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?
L419292 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ It's twelve o'clock.
L419291 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Do you hear that?
L419290 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ You're the most adorable cog I ever saw in my life. Ninotchka, Cogitska, let me confess something. Never did I dream I could feel like this toward a sergeant.
L419289 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
L419288 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ What kind of a girl are you, anyway?
L419287 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Don't pity me. Pity the Polish lancer. After all, I'm alive.
L419286 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.
L419285 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
L419284 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
L419283 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
L419282 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Wounded? How?
L419281 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I was wounded before Warsaw.
L419280 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ The bayonet? Did you really?
L419279 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.
L419278 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
L419277 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Don't do it, please.
L419276 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I'd like to say it a thousand times.
L419275 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ You repeat yourself.
L419274 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
L419273 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
L419272 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
L419271 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
L419270 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
L419269 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
L419268 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
L419267 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Look at me. The whites of your eyes are clear. Your cornea is excellent.
L419266 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Thank you.
L419265 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Your general appearance is not distasteful.
L419264 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
L419263 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ That is correct.
L419262 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Ni-notchka.
L419261 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.
L419260 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
L419259 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ That is why I believe in the future of my country.
L419258 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Thank you. Thank you.
L419257 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ You are something we do not have in Russia.
L419256 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
L419255 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ And what do you do for mankind?
L419254 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
L419253 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ And what is your profession?
L419252 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
L419251 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I will start with you.
L419250 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Not too big and not too small. What I'd call the typical room of an average man. Or shall we say a little above average. Now if there are any special aspects you wish to study I have nothing to conceal. Just look around. That's my desk. Those are my books, and here am I. Where shall we begin?
L419249 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.
L419248 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
L419247 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Is that customary?
L419246 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
L419245 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ What do we do now?
L419244 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today.
L419243 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat?
L419240 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ The day will come when you will be free. Go to bed, little father. We want to be alone.
L419239 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
L419238 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ He looks sad. Do you whip him?
L419237 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ He takes good care of that.
L419236 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
L419235 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yes.
L419234 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Is this what you call the "butler"?
L419230 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I will do my best.
L419229 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
L419228 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
L419227 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Then you don't want me to go there.
L419226 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Please don't misunderstand me...
L419225 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Does that mean that you want me to go there?
L419224 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Well, let's say I live in it. Such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...
L419223 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ So that is your house?
L419222 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
L419221 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
L419220 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ What a city! There are the Grands Boulevards... blasted out of the heart of the old streets. The Arc de Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's army. The Opera! And Montmartre... Montparnasse... La Bohème... and now I'll show you the greatest attraction!  It will cost me a franc but it is worth it.  The most wonderful spot in all Paris -- unique! Here, look....  What do you see?
L419219 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I do not deny its beauty, but it is a waste of electricity.
L419218 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ You must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles... It glitters!
L419217 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.
L419216 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
L419215 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Yes, it is.
L419214 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
L419213 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
L419211 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yes, very strange.
L419210 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ That's a strange angle.
L419209 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on the side of the Seine, and twenty- nine and one-half feet on the other side. The girders of interlaced iron- work which stay the structure have an inclination of fifty-four degrees...
L419208 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Go ahead.
L419207 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd...
L419203 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Your type will soon be extinct.
L419202 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!
L419201 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
L419200 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
L419199 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
L419198 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.
L419197 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
L419196 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I'll try.
L419195 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Suppress it.
L419194 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I don't have to but I find it natural.
L419193 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
L419192 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
L419191 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ And where are we?
L419190 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
L419189 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Why do you need my finger?
L419188 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Now, isn't that too bad! The last time I jumped I forgot to clock it!  Let me see... Eiffel Tower... Your finger, please.
L419187 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ How long does it take a man to land?
L419186 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.
L419185 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
L419184 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
L419183 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
L419182 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
L419181 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
L419180 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Love to.
L419179 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ You might hold this for me.
L419178 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Can I help you?
L419177 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ You're welcome.
L419176 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Thank you.
L419175 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ No.
L419174 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ In other words you don't know.
L419173 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
L419172 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
L419171 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
L419170 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
L419169 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ What?
L419168 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ At what intervals does he whistle?
L419167 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
L419166 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ How long do we have to wait here?
L419165 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Gladly.
L419164 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Yes. Could you give me some information?
L419163 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Me?
L419162 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ You, please.
L419872 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Thank you, Swana. You are very gracious.
L419871 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little château in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
L419870 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
L419869 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
L419868 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Now, please, Swana.
L419867 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ After our talk last night I took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning. Knowing how difficult it is to get into Soviet Russia, I thought I might be of some assistance to you.  May I introduce myself? I am the Duchess Swana of Russia... another Russia.
L419866 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Hello.
L419865 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Hello, Leon darling!
L419837 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Do you expect me to believe that?
L419836 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ She's gone, Leon.
L419835 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Has done what?
L419834 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
L419833 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ What is this, Swana?
L419832 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.
L419831 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I'm afraid that's what it is.
L419830 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
L419829 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
L419828 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?
L419827 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.
L419826 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
L419825 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana.
L419824 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Brutal frankness, if you insist.
L419823 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
L419822 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ All right, I'll listen.
L419821 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.
L419820 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...
L419819 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yes.
L419818 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
L419817 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
L419816 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
L419815 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ No thanks, Swana.
L419814 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?
L419649 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree.  The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?
L419648 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days.
L419643 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ I'm going, Leon...  but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?
L419642 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there?
L419639 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are talking in mysteries.... I'm sure you wonder what it's all about.
L419638 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Months, Swana.
