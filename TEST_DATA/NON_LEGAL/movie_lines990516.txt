L655096 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
L654778 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Goodbye, Sandra.
L654777 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.
L654775 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
L654774 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter.  So what?
L654772 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.
L654771 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Didn't you see her this morning?
L654770 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Shit. Here we go again.
L654769 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No.
L654768 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
L654767 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Sandy... What's up?
L654730 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.  Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of.  You ought to try it some time.
L654729 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
L654728 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
L654727 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
L654726 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.
L654724 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Can't.  Got a passenger.
L654723 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Why don't you come in, have a drink?
L654722 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hi, Sandy.
L654721 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ What?  You're going to drive off without even saying hi?
L657170 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ I'm sure we will.
L657169 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.
L657163 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well, sure.  Didn't you get your orders?
L657162 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ What is this?  A whole new train?
L657161 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.
L657151 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ In the next two minutes?
L657150 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
L657149 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
L657148 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
L657121 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Oh, I see, an easy plan!
L657120 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!
L657115 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Where have you been?
L657114 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ My God!  He's so excessive!
L657078 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!
L657077 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ God in heaven, what is that?!
L657070 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Thank you.
L657069 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ My hat is off to you, sir.
L657066 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Of course not.
L657065 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Are those just button buttons or...?
L657064 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
L657063 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ It was in your book.
L657058 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
L657057 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ There's only seventy-eight.
L657056 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
L657055 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
L657054 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
L657053 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I know!  I know!
L657052 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ What?  President Grant is...!
L657051 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Artemus, you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque.
L657002 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ My pleasure.
L657001 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh, thank you.
L657000 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.
L656996 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Not likely.  There must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...
L656995 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
L656983 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
L656982 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ When we find him, he is mine.
L656980 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
L656979 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
L656978 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ I adjusted it.
L656977 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Not again.
L656976 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  I spent three years on the stage, you know.  Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear.
L656975 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ And people are actually fooled by that?
L656974 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
L656973 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What is that?
L656971 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ We oughta get a couple of those rockets.  Voom!  We're there before we left!
L656970 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Relax.  We're almost there.
L656969 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.
L656968 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico?
L656967 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot."
L656966 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ It's a town!
L656965 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ It's not a guy...
L656964 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Willard...
L656955 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Yes.  And a much nicer one than ours.
L656954 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
L656953 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ What's this?
L656952 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
L656951 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No record of him.
L656950 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard.
L656949 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ It is?
L656948 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ It's better than nothing.
L656947 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Oh, damn!  That's it.
L656945 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
L656944 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ This is good.
L656938 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ A cylinder recorder.  My own design.
L656937 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
L656936 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Know what this is?
L656898 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ You go ahead.  I'll stick with Loveless.
L656897 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
L656896 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Thank you.
L656895 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
L656894 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Can you fill me in here?
L656884 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
L656883 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ They're so precious when they're asleep.
L656881 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
L656880 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
L656879 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
L656878 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You might have mentioned you had that.
L656874 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I was six.  And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later.
L656873 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Uh... how long ago was this?
L656872 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
L656871 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ So... what happened?
L656870 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
L656869 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Well... that, too.
L656868 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ "Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
L656867 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
L656866 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What way is that?
L656865 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?
L656864 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas.  Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works.
L656863 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
L656862 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Jim, are you all right?
L656858 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ That's right... That's good.
L656857 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
L656856 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Damn it, this is ridiculous.
L656855 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Hey, I tried the board.
L656854 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ At least I tried something.
L656850 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ It's a repeating steam cannon!
L656849 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Never seen a gun fire so fast!
L656848 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I'm going to hit you.
L656847 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
L656845 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
L656844 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.
L656835 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
L656834 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ All that jumping and kicking.
L656833 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ All what?
L656832 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ What was all that back there?
L656811 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
L656810 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
L656809 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Now, what was that?
L656808 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.  Dot...  Dash.  It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.
L656807 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You feeling all right?
L656806 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Yes.  Now, observe....
L656805 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Almost?
L656804 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.
L656800 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Then we've got our proof. Excellent.  And where do we find this fortunate scientist?
L656799 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
L656798 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
L656797 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
L656720 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Do your own mingling.  I'm not hanging around with some dandy named Chauncey.
L656719 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
L656718 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ That's a lot of butler.
L656716 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Jim, people talk to foreigners, speak more openly, especially to those as famous as I, Chauncey McNeil Armstrong, English lyric poet.
L656715 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
L656714 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.
L656712 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ My disguise.  And here...
L656711 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Prepare what?
L656710 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.
L656709 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Absolutely.  Have to look for clues... even if it means dancing with beautiful women.
L656708 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
L656707 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Limestone quarry?
L656697 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What about the explosive?
L656696 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
L656695 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Starting with a screw?
L656694 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
L656693 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Is this leading somewhere?
L656692 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
L656691 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Aha?
L656690 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Aha!
L656667 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ I'll work on it.
L656666 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ That should put us ahead of the criminals.
L656663 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
L656662 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.
L656661 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Try what?
L656660 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
L656659 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
L656658 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
L656657 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Always hoping.  Or this...
L656656 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You need that real often?
L656655 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
L656653 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ "Gadget guy?"  While I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, I am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science.
L656652 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
L656651 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...
L656650 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ "Ay, there's the rub."  Take a look at this file on Professor Morton.  Quite a brilliant fellow... metallurgy.
L656649 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
L656648 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
L656647 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Put them all together and what do we have?
L656646 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
L656645 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Wouldn't dream of it.
L656644 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ But don't pull that again.
L656632 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.
L656631 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.
L656630 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors.
L656629 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
L656628 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Interesting.  Mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk...
L656627 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
L656626 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
L656625 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Funny.  So am I.
L656624 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
L656623 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
L656622 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
L656621 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Jim West.
L656620 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ J. S. Bach.
L657107 +++$+++ u8925 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ PEMBERTON +++$+++ Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
L657106 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
L657088 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
L657087 +++$+++ u8925 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ PEMBERTON +++$+++ He's not giving up?
L657080 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ But it only has six legs.
L657079 +++$+++ u8925 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ PEMBERTON +++$+++ He calls it the Tarantula.
L657060 +++$+++ u8925 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ PEMBERTON +++$+++ My Lord, he was telling the truth!
L657059 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ You didn't tell us you had this on!
L656824 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ You?  Dr. Pemberton?  Of course. How novel.
