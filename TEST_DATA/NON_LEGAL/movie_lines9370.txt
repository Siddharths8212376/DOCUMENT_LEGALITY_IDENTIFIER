L497196 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ It'll just be me.
L497195 +++$+++ u2693 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ Plenty of room for two people.
L497816 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Shut up!!!
L497815 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
L497814 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Answer him, goddammit!!
L497813 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Goddamit...
L497812 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband?
L497795 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I'm not going to give you my keys.
L497794 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!
L497793 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ My keys?
L497792 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Give me your keys.
L497790 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No.
L497789 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.
L497788 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No.
L497787 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what I say. Give me those tapes.
L497786 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No.
L497785 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes.
L497784 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ God, you need help.
L497783 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What the hell do you think? I love Ann. You think I'm going to tell her about Cynthia and hurt her feelings like that?
L497782 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ She's not property, John, she's a person. Were you just going to keep right on lying to her?
L497781 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ So is my wife, asshole!!
L497780 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
L497779 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You know which tapes! Where are they?
L497778 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ What tapes?
L497777 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Where are the tapes, Graham?
L497776 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Hi, John.
L497183 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Or go someplace in a hurry.
L497182 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
L497181 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I like having the car, the car is important.
L497180 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key.
L497178 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What do you mean?
L497177 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I wish I didn't have to live someplace.
L497168 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ She held up very well.
L497167 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Really. How'd it go?
L497166 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes, this afternoon. I was grilling Ann about your marriage this afternoon.
L497165 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You were prying before?
L497164 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
L497159 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ You have family here also?
L497158 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yeah, it's not bad. Usually Ann has some serious salt action going. I keep telling her, you can always add more if you want, but you can't take it out.
L497155 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ A bonfire, probably.
L497154 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
L497153 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Everybody has a past.
L497977 +++$+++ u2695 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ VOICE ON PHONE +++$+++ Mr. Kirkland has asked me to inform you that he has obtained legal representation elsewhere, and that if you have a message for him to leave it with me.
L497976 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yes?
L497975 +++$+++ u2695 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ VOICE ON PHONE +++$+++ Mr. Millaney?
L497968 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Anyway, I've always said, the work is the thing. I can be happy without a marriage, but take away my work, that's different. And if Ann can't handle that, that's her problem, like we re all alone in this world, you know what I'm saying? I mean, fuck.  Jesus, what's takin' this guy?
L497967 +++$+++ u2695 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ VOICE ON PHONE +++$+++ One moment.
L497966 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ John Millaney.
L497965 +++$+++ u2695 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ VOICE ON PHONE +++$+++ May I ask who's calling?
L497964 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Brian Kirkland, please.
L497963 +++$+++ u2695 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ VOICE ON PHONE +++$+++ IBM.
L497974 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ All right, jesus.
L497973 +++$+++ u2694 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ He said immediately.
L497972 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
L497971 +++$+++ u2694 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
L497970 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yeah.
L497969 +++$+++ u2694 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Mr. Millaney?
L503325 +++$+++ u2696 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ BETTS +++$+++ Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you to make love to me. Please, please make love to me.
L503324 +++$+++ u2701 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ JANINE +++$+++ Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny.
L503211 +++$+++ u2696 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ BETTS +++$+++ Was he nice to you?
L503210 +++$+++ u2701 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ JANINE +++$+++ No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
L503209 +++$+++ u2696 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ BETTS +++$+++ Hi. Want a drink?
L503208 +++$+++ u2701 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ JANINE +++$+++ Hi.
L503158 +++$+++ u2696 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ BETTS +++$+++ So? You'll find out what's wrong and then you'll be able to relax a little bit. Let him be the uptight one for a change.
L503157 +++$+++ u2701 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ JANINE +++$+++ He'll be really mad.
L503156 +++$+++ u2696 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ BETTS +++$+++ Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
L503155 +++$+++ u2701 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ JANINE +++$+++ He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
L503154 +++$+++ u2696 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ BETTS +++$+++ ...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?
L503221 +++$+++ u2697 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
L503220 +++$+++ u2700 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ Jesus!
L503218 +++$+++ u2700 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ With some milk jugs I just happened to pick up on the way home.
L503217 +++$+++ u2697 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
L503216 +++$+++ u2700 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
L503215 +++$+++ u2697 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead.
L503214 +++$+++ u2700 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it.
L503115 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ He sounded fine.
L503114 +++$+++ u2698 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ DETECTIVE +++$+++ How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
L503113 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come.
L503112 +++$+++ u2698 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ DETECTIVE +++$+++ I see. Then what brought you up here?
L503111 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
L503110 +++$+++ u2698 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ DETECTIVE +++$+++ So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
L503109 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
L503108 +++$+++ u2698 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ DETECTIVE +++$+++ You knew these people?
L503107 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ No, nothing.
L503106 +++$+++ u2698 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ DETECTIVE +++$+++ Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
L503105 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ Yes.
L503104 +++$+++ u2698 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ DETECTIVE +++$+++ You're the one who found the bodies?
L503103 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ Sure.
L503102 +++$+++ u2698 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ DETECTIVE +++$+++ Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
L503101 +++$+++ u2698 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ DETECTIVE +++$+++ Well, let's go talk to your doctor.
L503100 +++$+++ u2706 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ SUPER +++$+++ Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
L503099 +++$+++ u2698 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ DETECTIVE +++$+++ Medical clinic?
L503098 +++$+++ u2706 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ SUPER +++$+++ Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here.
L503097 +++$+++ u2698 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ DETECTIVE +++$+++ Is that the man who called you up here?
L503096 +++$+++ u2706 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ SUPER +++$+++ Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
L503095 +++$+++ u2698 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ DETECTIVE +++$+++ And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
L503302 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ Down to the incinerator.
L503301 +++$+++ u2699 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ FORSYTHE +++$+++ But where are you going?
L503287 +++$+++ u2699 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ FORSYTHE +++$+++ Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you.
L503286 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
L503285 +++$+++ u2699 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ FORSYTHE +++$+++ I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
L503284 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ Where is he now? Do you know?
L503283 +++$+++ u2699 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ FORSYTHE +++$+++ A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just...  ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...
L503282 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? What's happened?
L503272 +++$+++ u2699 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ FORSYTHE +++$+++ Great! Go back to your files. Bye.
L503271 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ OK. But late.
L503270 +++$+++ u2699 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ FORSYTHE +++$+++ Well? Supper at my place?
L503269 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ No. I don't think so.
L503268 +++$+++ u2699 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ FORSYTHE +++$+++ Anything wrong?
L503267 +++$+++ u2699 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ FORSYTHE +++$+++ Doesn't matter to me how late it is. I can keep it warm.
L503266 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
L503265 +++$+++ u2699 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ FORSYTHE +++$+++ Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
L503239 +++$+++ u2699 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ FORSYTHE +++$+++ No. Dotty's the last.
L503238 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
L503237 +++$+++ u2699 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ FORSYTHE +++$+++ Another kiss?
L503236 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ Uh, OK. Sure.
L503235 +++$+++ u2699 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ FORSYTHE +++$+++ Kiss, kiss?
L503234 +++$+++ u2699 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ FORSYTHE +++$+++ Do I get a kiss?
L503233 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
L503232 +++$+++ u2699 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ FORSYTHE +++$+++ OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files I helped compile before your time here, Doctor. I thought they might interest you.
L503181 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
L503180 +++$+++ u2699 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ FORSYTHE +++$+++ Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
L503315 +++$+++ u2701 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ JANINE +++$+++ I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?
L503314 +++$+++ u2707 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ TUDOR +++$+++ Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...
L503310 +++$+++ u2707 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ TUDOR +++$+++ Please, Janine. Please, pleasepleaseplease, Janine Janine JanineJanineJanine...
L503309 +++$+++ u2701 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ JANINE +++$+++ Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
L503308 +++$+++ u2707 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ TUDOR +++$+++ You will make love to me, won't you, Janine? Won't you make love to me? You start it. Won't you? I think I've forgotten how to start.
L503307 +++$+++ u2701 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ JANINE +++$+++ Nick, you're so strange...
L503306 +++$+++ u2707 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ TUDOR +++$+++ Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?
L503152 +++$+++ u2707 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ TUDOR +++$+++ Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
L503151 +++$+++ u2701 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ JANINE +++$+++ You say something?
L503089 +++$+++ u2707 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ TUDOR +++$+++ I won't be at the office except to sign in.  I've got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place. Garages and more garages.  I'll come home right after work.
L503088 +++$+++ u2701 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ JANINE +++$+++ I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
L503087 +++$+++ u2707 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ TUDOR +++$+++ What do you want to call me at the office for?
L503086 +++$+++ u2701 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ JANINE +++$+++ Can I call you at the office?
L503333 +++$+++ u2702 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ MR. SPERGAZZI +++$+++ Oh, but the nurse, she went away. I think she must go to look for you.
L503332 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
L503331 +++$+++ u2702 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ MR. SPERGAZZI +++$+++ Yes? Who is there?
L503300 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ OK. I'll meet you back there. Don't leave until I get there. Lock the door and don't open it except for me. OK?
L503299 +++$+++ u2702 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ MR. SPERGAZZI +++$+++ We live in 703.
L503298 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ Go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns. It'll have to do for now.  What's your number? The number of your apartment?
L503296 +++$+++ u2702 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ MR. SPERGAZZI +++$+++ I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.
L503295 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ Where is this thing that attacked your wife?
L503293 +++$+++ u2702 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ MR. SPERGAZZI +++$+++ Please pardon me. I am Niccolo Spergazzi. I am a resident here. I don't know... we were walking in the hallway and... Cabiria... my wife... she was attacked by this thing... here, on her arm.
L503292 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ What happened?
L503207 +++$+++ u2703 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ PARKINS +++$+++ Used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did.  Cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that.
L503206 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
L503205 +++$+++ u2703 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ PARKINS +++$+++ Gonna cut me open?
L503204 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology.
L503202 +++$+++ u2703 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ PARKINS +++$+++ That's the one.
L503201 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
L503200 +++$+++ u2703 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ PARKINS +++$+++ Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed.  She was gone when I got back from my last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a beautiful tan.  Must have gone home to mother.
L503199 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
L503198 +++$+++ u2703 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ PARKINS +++$+++ Didn't seem worried about them.
L503197 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
L503196 +++$+++ u2703 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ PARKINS +++$+++ She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
L503195 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
L503194 +++$+++ u2703 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ PARKINS +++$+++ Good shape for an old man, eh?
L503193 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ Just breathe normally.
L503192 +++$+++ u2703 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ PARKINS +++$+++ Want me to breathe deeply?
L503264 +++$+++ u2704 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ROLLO +++$+++ OK, Rog. See you at ten.
L503263 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.
L503262 +++$+++ u2704 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ROLLO +++$+++ I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. I'll bring a bagful. It's just the standard tropical kit. But the trick is to get at them.
L503261 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ Yeah? What do I do then?
L503260 +++$+++ u2704 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ROLLO +++$+++ Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
L503259 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
L503258 +++$+++ u2704 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ROLLO +++$+++ I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
L503257 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
L503256 +++$+++ u2704 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ROLLO +++$+++ Huh?
L503255 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ He didn't make it.
L503252 +++$+++ u2704 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ROLLO +++$+++ Lemme clarify for you.
L503251 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ I don't get it.
L503250 +++$+++ u2704 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ROLLO +++$+++ It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
L503249 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ OK, I bite. What does it look like?
L503248 +++$+++ u2704 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ROLLO +++$+++ Listen, Rog. I knew Hobbes was funny, you know? I told you that. But I didn't really know just how funny he was. See... when he kicked off, they sent all the personal secret stuff they found to his mother -- she's still alive but just barely -- and she sent everything she thought was medical to me here at the lab. I'm Hobbes's partner, right?  Anyway, I've been going through his papers, and what they add up to is this: Hobbes was shafting us all, me, the university, the foundations and the councils, the private labs, everybody. We never really knew what it was we were working on. Hobbes gave us each a few crumbs, but he was the only one who knew what the whole loaf would look like.
L503247 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ No? How come?
L503246 +++$+++ u2704 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ROLLO +++$+++ Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them.
L503244 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ Rollo! How'sa boy? I was just thinking about you.
L503243 +++$+++ u2704 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ROLLO +++$+++ It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
L503242 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ Yes?
L503241 +++$+++ u2704 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ROLLO +++$+++ That you, Rog?
L503240 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ Yes?
L503150 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ OK. I'll think about it.
L503149 +++$+++ u2704 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ROLLO +++$+++ But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?
L503145 +++$+++ u2704 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ROLLO +++$+++ Aw, he met her when he was lecturing at some private girls' school. They caught him examining her little tits for breast cancer in the faculty lounge. She was twelve. Don't ask. It was craziness, believe me.  They used to come here sometimes.  Don't ask.
L503144 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ Who was she?
L503143 +++$+++ u2704 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ROLLO +++$+++ It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
L503142 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
L503141 +++$+++ u2704 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ROLLO +++$+++ You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
L503140 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP.
L503139 +++$+++ u2704 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ROLLO +++$+++ Rog, I gotta talk serious to you. Really. Listen. Ya listening? OK. I want you to come into this with me. To tell the honest-to-God truth, I'm lonely.  All Hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night. He wanted you in anyway. That's why we were gonna get together, the three of us. We would have enough to keep us going for at least five years, even with inflation.
L503133 +++$+++ u2704 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ROLLO +++$+++ You know and I know that Hobbes was a lousy teacher, eh? Lousy. Dry, academic, afraid of women, lousy. But he was always a genius at one thing -- getting grants. Could he get grants for crazy projects?
L503132 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ I don't get it.
L503131 +++$+++ u2704 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ROLLO +++$+++ Right. It's crazy. But here's the beauty part. Ready?  Who cares?
L503130 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ It's crazy.
L503129 +++$+++ u2704 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ROLLO +++$+++ You put the bug into the body of a man with a diseased kidney, the bug attacks the bad kidney, dissolves it, it's assimilated by the body, and now you got a perfectly good parasite where you used to have a rotten kidney. I know what you're gonna say. You're gonna say it's crazy.
L503128 +++$+++ u2704 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ROLLO +++$+++ Look. You got men, you got parasites that live in, on, and around men. Now. Why not breed a parasite that does something useful? Eh? Why not breed a parasite capable of taking over the function of any one of a bunch of human organs? Why not, for example, a parasite living in the human abdominal cavity that plugs into the circulatory system and filters the blood like a kidney? If it takes a little blood for itself, so what? Be generous! You can afford it.
L503127 +++$+++ u2705 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ST. LUC +++$+++ Did I say anything?
L503126 +++$+++ u2704 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ROLLO +++$+++ I know. You're bored already. Transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?
L503123 +++$+++ u2704 +++$+++ m176 +++$+++ ROLLO +++$+++ That was my father's idea... private practice. He wanted to set me up -- I couldn't say no. But he's dead now. And me, I'm still a snoop, I gotta do research. Look at that beautiful stuff...  ...lookit it!
