L461287 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ You don't think either one of us could ever change?
L461280 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ If anything, I'm making it sound good.  Let's face it, Lisa... you aren't made for that kind of a life. Few people are.
L461279 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
L461278 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isn't raining  Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive!
L461276 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Well, they'd be very stylish in Finland -- just before you froze to death. Begin to get the idea?
L461275 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Three.
L461274 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie --
L461273 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera?
L461272 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Oh, I do that all the time. Whenever I have a few minutes after lunch.
L461271 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ You might have to, if you went with me. Ever try to keep warm in a C-54, at fifteen thousand feet, at twenty below zero?
L461270 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Of course not.
L461269 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
L461268 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Lisa! Shut up!
L461267 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
L461266 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Lisa, simmer down -- will you?
L461263 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ It's ridiculous for you to say that it can only be done by a special, private little group of anointed people.
L461262 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --
L461261 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation.
L461260 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
L461259 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
L461258 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
L461257 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand --
L461252 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
L461251 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
L461250 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I think it's enchanting.
L461249 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage.
L461247 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?
L461246 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ How can you tell that -- from here?
L461245 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
L461244 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one.
L461243 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours.  You, of course, remember Miss Torso.
L461242 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
L461241 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
L461240 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ That's what is know as "manless melancholia."
L461238 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?
L461237 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
L461236 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard? 
L461235 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Don't laugh. -- I could do it!
L461234 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ For yourself -- and me.  I could get you a dozen assignments tomorrow... fashion, portraits --
L461233 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ For what?
L461232 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Yes.
L461231 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ You mean leave the magazine?
L461230 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Make the one you want.
L461229 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I wish there was one I wanted.
L461228 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment.
L461227 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?
L461226 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
L461225 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ That's good news.
L461224 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ You can't buy that kind of publicity.
L461222 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ She looked very cool. She had on a mint green --
L461221 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?
L461220 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne -- just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the "21" for lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered dinner. Then two Fall showings -- twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward -- we're trying to get his next show.  Then I had to dash back and change.
L461219 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Tired?
L461218 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ What a day I've had!
L461212 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget.
L461211 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
L461210 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through. And the last week must be the hardest.
L461209 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Fine. Corkscrew's on the right.
L461208 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Big enough?
L461198 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ You have, perhaps, an ambulance outside?
L461197 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ What would you think of starting off with dinner at the "21"?
L461196 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh!
L461195 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
L461194 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
L461193 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Picked it up in Shanghai -- which has also seen better days.
L461191 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
L461190 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
L461189 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ It's just a run-of-the-mill Monday. The calendar's loaded with them.
L461188 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Going on right here. It's a big night.
L461187 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Something big going on somewhere?
L461185 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Who buys them? Tax collectors?
L461184 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
L461183 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
L461182 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ -- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.
L461181 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Depends on the quote. Let's see -- there's the plane tickets over, import duties, hidden taxes, profit markups --
L461179 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Only because it's expected of her.
L461178 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
L461174 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L461173 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Anything else bothering you?
L461172 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Not too active.
L461171 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ And you love life?
L461170 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Empty as a football.
L461169 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ And your stomach?
L461168 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Mmmm -- hurts a little.
L461167 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ How's your leg?
L461826 +++$+++ u2577 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ POLICE +++$+++ Two minutes.
L461825 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Chelsea 2-5598.
L461824 +++$+++ u2577 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ POLICE +++$+++ Phone number?
L461823 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ L. B. Jefferies.
L461822 +++$+++ u2577 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ POLICE +++$+++ Your name?
L461821 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ A man is assaulting a woman at one two five west ninth street. Second floor rear. Make it fast.
L462403 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Good luck, Buzz.
L462402 +++$+++ u2580 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ What's happening?
L462400 +++$+++ u2580 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Give me some dirt.
L462399 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Feel okay?
L462253 +++$+++ u2580 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ What's eating you, Judy?  You want him alive?
L462252 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Buzzie--we better get out of here.
L462144 +++$+++ u2580 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ They always live.
L462143 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
L462142 +++$+++ u2580 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Nobody chickened.
L462141 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I'm glad they let you out.
L462140 +++$+++ u2580 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Friend of yours?
L462139 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ A new disease.
L462138 +++$+++ u2580 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ What's that?
L462137 +++$+++ u2580 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Wanna make the colored lights go around and around?
L462136 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Steady Marlon!
L462398 +++$+++ u2580 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ We got to do something.  Don't we?
L462397 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
L462396 +++$+++ u2580 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ I like you, you know?
L462395 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yeah.
L462394 +++$+++ u2580 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ This is the edge, boy.  This is the end.
L462383 +++$+++ u2580 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Okay.
L462382 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Sure.  It's fine.
L462376 +++$+++ u2580 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Glad to meet you.
L462375 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Hi.
L462374 +++$+++ u2580 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Buzz Gundersen.
L462373 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Jim Stark.
L462372 +++$+++ u2580 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ What you say your name was?
L462371 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Stay there.
L462370 +++$+++ u2580 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Just him.
L462255 +++$+++ u2580 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Know the Millertown bluff?
L462254 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Where can we meet?
L462251 +++$+++ u2580 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ How 'bout you?  Say the word and you're cold, Jack--you're dead.
L462250 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You satisfied or you want more?
L462232 +++$+++ u2580 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Somebody find him a knife.
L462231 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Machismo?
L462228 +++$+++ u2580 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Who's fighting?  This is the test, man.  It's a crazy game.
L462227 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I thought only punks fought with knives.
L462224 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Chicken?
L462223 +++$+++ u2580 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ What?
L462222 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Meaning me?
L462221 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I'm cute, too.
L462220 +++$+++ u2580 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Hey, he's real abstract and different.
L462219 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You watch too much television.
L462218 +++$+++ u2580 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ What?
L462217 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You know something?
L462761 +++$+++ u2591 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Down in back.
L462760 +++$+++ u2581 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ CHIEF +++$+++ Any other entrance?
L462759 +++$+++ u2591 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Smashed the front door.
L462758 +++$+++ u2581 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ CHIEF +++$+++ How'd he get in?
L462757 +++$+++ u2591 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
L462756 +++$+++ u2581 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ CHIEF +++$+++ We heard firing.  He get anybody? You alone?
L462647 +++$+++ u2582 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ CRUNCH +++$+++ Then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
L462646 +++$+++ u2588 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOOSE +++$+++ No.
L462645 +++$+++ u2582 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ CRUNCH +++$+++ You still want to go home, Moose?
L462644 +++$+++ u2588 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOOSE +++$+++ That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
L462643 +++$+++ u2582 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ CRUNCH +++$+++ Hang loose.  We got all night.
L462642 +++$+++ u2588 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOOSE +++$+++ What time is it?
L462498 +++$+++ u2582 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ CRUNCH +++$+++ You clean out of your head?  Come on!
L462497 +++$+++ u2588 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOOSE +++$+++ Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
L462496 +++$+++ u2582 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ CRUNCH +++$+++ No.  We're going to bring him down.
L462495 +++$+++ u2588 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOOSE +++$+++ I think I should go home.
L462494 +++$+++ u2582 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ CRUNCH +++$+++ He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
L462493 +++$+++ u2588 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOOSE +++$+++ No--
L462492 +++$+++ u2582 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ CRUNCH +++$+++ You see any cops?
L462488 +++$+++ u2582 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ CRUNCH +++$+++ You see any cops?
L462487 +++$+++ u2588 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOOSE +++$+++ Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
L462486 +++$+++ u2582 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ CRUNCH +++$+++ What's he going to pull--
L462834 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ And you can depend on me, son. Trust me.  Whatever comes we'll face it together, I swear.
L462833 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ He depended on me.
L462478 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?
L462477 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Son--this is all happening so fast--
L462472 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I don't want to learn that!
L462471 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.
L462468 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off?
L462467 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it?
L462464 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You don't want me to go.
L462463 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Will you wait a minute?
L462462 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Except yourself!
L462454 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Well--
L462453 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I don't think so--
L462450 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ You what?
L462449 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
L462448 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ You're absolutely right!
L462447 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
L462446 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Well, just get it off your chest, son.
L462440 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
L462439 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Will you let him tell it!
L462433 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I was in it.
L462432 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V.
L462431 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
L462430 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Go ahead.
L462352 +++$+++ u2583 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ I just want to show you how foolish you are.  When you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important--
L462351 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
