L292781 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ The only thing you can't do is get sex for free.  I know I was in prison for like basically the 80's, but, call me daffy, aren't you supposed to <u>stop</u> me from committing crimes.  You know, Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup, Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.
L292780 +++$+++ u5950 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ GATES +++$+++ The auction house, asshole.  One night's work and you're free like no ex-con's ever been.  No checking in with a shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey. It's a great deal, I can't lie.
L292779 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ What job?
L292778 +++$+++ u5950 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ GATES +++$+++ Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.
L292777 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.
L292776 +++$+++ u5950 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ GATES +++$+++ Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...
L293337 +++$+++ u5953 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ MINERVA +++$+++ I killed some lovable working class Italian-diabetic, but you killed the most significant male figure of the decade and a kind, gentle lover.  So don't play with me.
L293336 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
L293335 +++$+++ u5953 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ MINERVA +++$+++ If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here....
L293333 +++$+++ u5953 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ MINERVA +++$+++ You can't, convict!  You're just a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them.  It rains, car crash stops traffic, you say "How could this happen to me?"  It's a natural inclination.  But for I, this isn't a fantasy, it is <u>reality</u>! You are on my planet!  You walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist!  The lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!
L293332 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?
L293331 +++$+++ u5953 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ MINERVA +++$+++ It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
L293330 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ You killed a friend.  Why should I help you go for the gold?
L293289 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ If you think you're getting past me...
L293288 +++$+++ u5953 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ MINERVA +++$+++ I hate a man with a sense of humor.  While you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity, we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way: a thoroughly corrupt business deal.
L293163 +++$+++ u5953 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ MINERVA +++$+++ You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I think I know what's going to help you solve it.

L293153 +++$+++ u5953 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ MINERVA +++$+++ Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical.  On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart.  Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.
L293133 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Two minutes, 35 seconds.  Damnit, I'm involved in this thing, so I just wanna know what this thing is. I wanna be treated as an adult.

L293123 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Just browsing.  Don't touch me....
L293122 +++$+++ u5953 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ MINERVA +++$+++ Get away from there, convict!
L292978 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ You wouldn't risk the dime to call the police.  You have no proof.
L292977 +++$+++ u5953 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ MINERVA +++$+++ You go back, you won't be alone. You'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  You're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "Alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. Depressing.
L292976 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Anybody have a cigarette?  But seriously, do me a favor and Concorde me back to prison.  I don't care anymore.  I hope you have the receipts for the threads.

L293276 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ No.  But why do you let Butterfinger keep those blood stains on his shirt?
L293275 +++$+++ u5952 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ KAPLAN +++$+++ I can't believe this.  I'm in fucking Russia, or do I have to say, the fucking Soviet Union and I'm shooting a non-Bolshevick.  I never thought I'd say "I'm just in this job for the money."  Sad. Any last immature quips?
L293271 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ I don't think you'll appreciate their choice of weenie.
L293270 +++$+++ u5952 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ KAPLAN +++$+++ They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.
L293269 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Can't you see the Mayflowers double-crossed you...
L293039 +++$+++ u5952 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ KAPLAN +++$+++ Yeah, right.  By the way, as long as I'm getting things off my chest, I'm the one who killed your little monkey.  Made it look like a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun. Ciao.
L293038 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ If you do anything to my friend...
L293037 +++$+++ u5952 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ KAPLAN +++$+++ We blow up space shuttles for breakfast.  You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.

L293028 +++$+++ u5952 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ KAPLAN +++$+++ God, I miss communism.  The Red Threat.  People were scared, the Agency was respected, and I got laid every night.

L293026 +++$+++ u5952 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ KAPLAN +++$+++ Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying Italy?  I always had a soft spot for Rome.  Did my first barehanded strangulation here.  Communist politician.
L292945 +++$+++ u5952 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ KAPLAN +++$+++ Shucks.  Guess not.
L292944 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ I'm supposed to fall for that?
L292943 +++$+++ u5952 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ KAPLAN +++$+++ No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?
L292942 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Employer?  The president?
L292941 +++$+++ u5952 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ KAPLAN +++$+++ Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.
L292940 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
L292939 +++$+++ u5952 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ KAPLAN +++$+++ I Want to make things up to you. That's why I got you this gig, doll.  Hawk, my name's George Kaplan and to quote the late, great Karen Carpenter, "We've only just begun."
L292938 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ To what do I owe the dishonor of a reunion, you centrally intelligent scumsicle.
L292937 +++$+++ u5952 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ KAPLAN +++$+++ I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief...
L292936 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ But I'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge.
L292935 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Bastard, you're going to need another nose!
L292934 +++$+++ u5952 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ KAPLAN +++$+++ You just might.  I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.  At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, I won't be offended.
L292933 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Don't I know you...

L293827 +++$+++ u5968 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MOSES +++$+++ But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.

You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...

L294069 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
L294068 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Now, Aim --
L294067 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ ...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --
L294066 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You're awful kind to yourself, Norville Barnes -- the fact is you've slowed down, sitting up here like a sultan, not doing a lick of work! Why you know it's ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you haven't come up with one since the hoop and the reason's plain to see! You've forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place -- it wasn't for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of -- would you get out of here?!
L294065 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
L294064 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Your i --
L294063 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
L294062 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You mean you know about this?
L294061 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --
L294060 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
L294059 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
L294058 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ ...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?
L294057 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Never mind about that...
L294056 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --
L294055 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ For Pete's sake, Norville!
L293941 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Sure, Norville, sure...
L293940 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!
L293939 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Oh, Norville --
L293937 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...
L293936 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
L293935 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth.
L293934 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
L293933 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
L293932 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
L293931 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
L293930 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
L293929 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
L293928 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ What a beautiful thought.
L293927 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
L293926 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ ...The people look like ants.
L293925 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Well -- this year -- if it's good I plan to make it a tradition. Uh, my it certainly is beautiful --
L293924 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Every year?
L293923 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
L293922 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ You don't say.
L293921 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.
L293920 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
L293919 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Oh yes! In Muncie!
L293918 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ You know, on farm route 17.
L293917 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ ...Huh?
L293916 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
L293915 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ ...Certain people are --
L293914 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie...
L293913 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
L293912 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --
L293911 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front --  -- not that everyone's buying it.
L293910 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ ...You do?
L293909 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ I know that, Amy.
L293908 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.
