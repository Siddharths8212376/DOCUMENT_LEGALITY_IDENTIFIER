L140958 +++$+++ u710 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ BUTCH +++$+++ In this case, you might say I want to know how not to play the Big Con.
L140957 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
L140956 +++$+++ u710 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ BUTCH +++$+++ Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
L140955 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
L140954 +++$+++ u710 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ BUTCH +++$+++ Keeping the Fix happy.
L140932 +++$+++ u710 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ BUTCH +++$+++ And these cops? What do they get?
L140931 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.
L140819 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Isn't it always?
L140818 +++$+++ u710 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ BUTCH +++$+++ It's all about the money, isn't it?
L140817 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
L140816 +++$+++ u710 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ BUTCH +++$+++ Grifters...
L140751 +++$+++ u710 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ BUTCH +++$+++ That's not a bad place to start.
L140750 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Just the last three weeks.
L140749 +++$+++ u710 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ BUTCH +++$+++ Your life flashing before your eyes?
L140748 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Gee... What makes you say that?
L140747 +++$+++ u710 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ BUTCH +++$+++ Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.
L140746 +++$+++ u710 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ BUTCH +++$+++ No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.
L140745 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ The Anti-Christ?
L140744 +++$+++ u710 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ BUTCH +++$+++ Know who I am, Jake?
L140743 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ And I think it's because of this redhead...
L141645 +++$+++ u711 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GILLETTE +++$+++ Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
L141644 +++$+++ u710 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ BUTCH +++$+++ Ten is standard, sir.
L141641 +++$+++ u711 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GILLETTE +++$+++ And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?
L141640 +++$+++ u710 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ BUTCH +++$+++ We'll take care of it.
L141639 +++$+++ u711 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GILLETTE +++$+++ I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
L141638 +++$+++ u710 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ BUTCH +++$+++ So we go to the bar.
L141637 +++$+++ u711 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GILLETTE +++$+++ Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
L141636 +++$+++ u710 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ BUTCH +++$+++ Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?
L141368 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
L141367 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.
L141288 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
L141287 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ The red hair... It's bad luck.
L141051 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.
L141050 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.
L140879 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do?
L140878 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Fuck that. We're going too.
L140864 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ We're going to give him the money back?
L140863 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ Whoa. What?
L140858 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ Come on...
L140857 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ We sure Big Al threw him to us?
L140856 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young. The whole thing took about two and a half hours. That's how good he is.
L140854 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ No, that was the only semi-fucking smart thing he said! Except anybody that's ever met Big Al knows that the only thing he's comfortable doing alone is eating. This guys tells this guy, that guy tells some other guy, eventually it works it's way back to someone who works for the King and --
L140853 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You're pissed we didn't get credit?
L140852 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.
L140851 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ So what? We hide, right?
L140850 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.
L140849 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Mob?
L140848 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ Currently, the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses.
L140847 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What's a King Pin?
L140846 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."
L140845 +++$+++ u718 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Who's that?
L141489 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ Jake, I mean, come on --
L141488 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!
L141481 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ So what? We just stay clear of him.
L141480 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ Moonan. Here. Shit...
L141370 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ Let's go, Jake?
L141369 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ I'm going home
L141355 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
L141354 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ Jake...
L141335 +++$+++ u715 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?
L141334 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ Masters of our own destiny.
L141612 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
L141611 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
L141573 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ I'd like this cashed, please.
L141572 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Then he had to bang it out across the street at the Bank of the Caymens...
L141505 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ That's it.
L141504 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ So that's it...
L141487 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What do I always tell you guys? Don't spend it all. Sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. Save some. Put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. That's it. The gig's up.
L141486 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ Jake --
L141448 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ We'll use the Euc.
L141447 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ Calls?
L141446 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Eight A.M. flight.
L141445 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ You'll be there?
L141444 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
L141443 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.
L141372 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ You sure?
L141371 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
L141327 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says "The code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!
L141326 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.
L141297 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ She's up for it.
L141296 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ She up for this?
L141100 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance...
L141099 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease --
L141062 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ No, not "whatever." You're either in or you're out.
L141061 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ Yeah... Whatever, Jake.
L141038 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ We pay better.
L141037 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ How's that? He works for Gillette.
L141036 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.
L141031 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
L141030 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
L141029 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Two million.
L141028 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ How much we going after?
L140996 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
L140995 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ You gotta be kidding me. Her?
L140877 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Tonight. Just me.
L140876 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ When?
L140867 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Leave him. Someone's going to find him eventually. Then they'll start looking for us, too.
L140866 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ And what about Big Al?
L140865 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You know what we're doing with the money.
L140844 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ It gets worse. Now I know why he was such a good rope. I mean, cash... That much and we never had to put him on the "Send?" Turns out this ducking Moe was an accountant for the King Pin.
L140843 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Well, this is just fucking great...
L140842 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night. They just pulled him out of the East River.
L140823 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric?
L140822 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ It can buy you a new and better you.
L140801 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ I guess. I gotta drop a dime. Did anybody mess up the hoop?
L140800 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
L140799 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
L140798 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What? I can feel you looking at me.
L140791 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ But you won't get that splatter effect.
L140790 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I told you, use less powder.
L140789 +++$+++ u712 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ GORDO +++$+++ Shit.
L141134 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ Harder. Remember, I killed your buddy.
L141133 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I think I just broke my hand.
L141132 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ Come on. Harder.
L141128 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ Come here!
L141127 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ No thanks. I'm good.
L141126 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ Come here. Feel this.
L141125 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you?
L141124 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ Look at you, you skinny prick.
L141122 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ I said take off your fucking shirt.
L141121 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Excuse me?
L141119 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ No, you listen. We're partners now and even though I'm running the show for you, I'm still running the show. That means I get a little respect. So I don't want to hear anymore of this Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger, bullshit. It's Jake.  And I gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in better shape.
L141118 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ Listen, Scooter --
L141115 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ Hey Skippy? Do I have the word "chump" tattooed on my forehead?
L141114 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
L141113 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?
L141112 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.
L141111 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ Stake you?
L141110 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I need you to stake me.
L141109 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.
L141108 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I think two million.
L141107 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ How much?
L140927 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ You ask a lot of questions. Come on.  Let me see 'em.
L140926 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Why?
L140919 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
L140918 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once.
L140917 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ No. Just confidence.
L140916 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
L140915 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
L140914 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
L140913 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Because you killed one of my crew.
L140912 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ Let me repeat -- Why not?
L140911 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
L140910 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ Why not?
L140909 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I can't do that.
L140908 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
L140907 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I apologize for the inconvenience.
L140906 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
L140905 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You can't cheat an honest man.
L140904 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
L140903 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I guess it lacks a certain style.
L140902 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
L140901 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Minus one.
L140900 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ Minus one.
L140899 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I have a good crew.
L140898 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?
L140897 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
L140896 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldn't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you, Skippy.
L141583 +++$+++ u721 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ ROTTOVICH +++$+++ Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...?  It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.
L141582 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?
L141463 +++$+++ u721 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ ROTTOVICH +++$+++ Good boy.
L141462 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Something stupid.
L141461 +++$+++ u721 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ ROTTOVICH +++$+++ I don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? We get a big piece. If we find out you're keeping us out, I may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if we got a deal, Jake.
L141460 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Wouldn't dream of it.
L141459 +++$+++ u721 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ ROTTOVICH +++$+++ Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.
L141458 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Oh yeah. Moonan. I remember now. Thanks.
L141457 +++$+++ u721 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ ROTTOVICH +++$+++ Ring it for him, Sobo.
L141456 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
L141455 +++$+++ u721 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ ROTTOVICH +++$+++ Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
L141452 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business.
L141451 +++$+++ u721 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ ROTTOVICH +++$+++ Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
L141450 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ That tip not work-out for you fellas?
L140814 +++$+++ u721 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ ROTTOVICH +++$+++ Was that a threat? Did I hear a threat? Last I remember, we were talking economics, then this...? What happens next time if we gotta stop and help a little old lady cross the street? Well, shit... Then we gotta pass the call to someone else.
L140813 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
L140812 +++$+++ u721 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ ROTTOVICH +++$+++ Don't get me wrong, Jake. I like you boys. You guys are the steadiest business in town. But what can I say? Twenty percent's still better than what we give to any of the other criminals.
L140809 +++$+++ u721 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ ROTTOVICH +++$+++ Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.

L141229 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. Could you..?
L141225 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Very much so.
L141224 +++$+++ u720 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
L141223 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
L141222 +++$+++ u720 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ Attractive girl.
L141216 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
