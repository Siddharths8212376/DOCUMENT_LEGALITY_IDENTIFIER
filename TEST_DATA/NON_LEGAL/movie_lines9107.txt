L253878 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ What is this insolence?
L253877 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
L253876 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
L253875 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
L253874 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
L253856 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ You say that you are employed by us in Fredersdorf, and here you are in Berlin, indulging in diversions which ill befit your position and which are very much beyond your means -- Quite extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein, I think we will look into your books.
L253855 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ I could not think of not accepting.
L253854 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
L253848 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper, building C, room twenty-three -- third floor.
L253847 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ I don't know you.
L253846 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing?
L253183 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one.
L253182 +++$+++ u1196 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ ROHNA +++$+++ The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine.
L253179 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every day is precious -- every hour -- Every minute.
L253178 +++$+++ u1196 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ ROHNA +++$+++ Just one moment, sir.
L253177 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a cheap room? Did I?
L253176 +++$+++ u1196 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ ROHNA +++$+++ It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
L253175 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
L253174 +++$+++ u1196 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ ROHNA +++$+++ If you will wait one moment, sir.
L254196 +++$+++ u1193 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ MEIERHEIM +++$+++ Madam Grusinskaya's car.
L254195 +++$+++ u1194 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PIMENOV +++$+++ Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
L254194 +++$+++ u1193 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ MEIERHEIM +++$+++ Four minutes past. Please come.
L254189 +++$+++ u1193 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ MEIERHEIM +++$+++ The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
L254188 +++$+++ u1194 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PIMENOV +++$+++ What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.
L253324 +++$+++ u1193 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ MEIERHEIM +++$+++ When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.
L253323 +++$+++ u1194 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PIMENOV +++$+++ If the house is empty again, I don't know --
L253322 +++$+++ u1193 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ MEIERHEIM +++$+++ Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
L253321 +++$+++ u1194 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PIMENOV +++$+++ How is the house?
L253319 +++$+++ u1193 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ MEIERHEIM +++$+++ You are late. Hurry.
L253318 +++$+++ u1194 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PIMENOV +++$+++ We will wait.
L253781 +++$+++ u1201 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ ZINNOWITZ +++$+++ Bluff does it, Preysing, bluff does it. Goodnight.
L253780 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
L253779 +++$+++ u1201 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ ZINNOWITZ +++$+++ Pretty as a picture.
L253778 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
L253777 +++$+++ u1201 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ ZINNOWITZ +++$+++ She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
L253776 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
L253775 +++$+++ u1201 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ ZINNOWITZ +++$+++ What do you want with her?
L253774 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
L253773 +++$+++ u1201 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ ZINNOWITZ +++$+++ I can understand that -- after your -- uh --
L253772 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.
L253771 +++$+++ u1201 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ ZINNOWITZ +++$+++ What you need is some relaxation.
L253770 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
L253769 +++$+++ u1201 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ ZINNOWITZ +++$+++ You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
L253768 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... 
L253767 +++$+++ u1201 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ ZINNOWITZ +++$+++ 'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
L253766 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ That.
L253765 +++$+++ u1201 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ ZINNOWITZ +++$+++ What's bluff?
L253764 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
L253763 +++$+++ u1201 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ ZINNOWITZ +++$+++ What's the matter with you?
L253760 +++$+++ u1201 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ ZINNOWITZ +++$+++ You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time. Why?
L253759 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ Next week.
L253608 +++$+++ u1201 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ ZINNOWITZ +++$+++ Well -- gentlemen.
L253607 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
L253604 +++$+++ u1201 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ ZINNOWITZ +++$+++ But the situation is perfectly clear, If you will allow me -- 
L253603 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
L253602 +++$+++ u1201 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ ZINNOWITZ +++$+++ Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway.
L253360 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ Good night.
L253359 +++$+++ u1201 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ ZINNOWITZ +++$+++ I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
L253358 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
L253357 +++$+++ u1201 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ ZINNOWITZ +++$+++ Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
L253356 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
L253355 +++$+++ u1201 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ ZINNOWITZ +++$+++ Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
L253354 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference?
L253156 +++$+++ u1201 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ ZINNOWITZ +++$+++ I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter ---
L253155 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ I know -- I know.
L253154 +++$+++ u1201 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ ZINNOWITZ +++$+++ Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
L253153 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ No. No word.
L253152 +++$+++ u1201 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ ZINNOWITZ +++$+++ No news yet?
L253151 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
L253150 +++$+++ u1201 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ ZINNOWITZ +++$+++ Have I kept you waiting?
L253149 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
L255512 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ I will. So long, Bobo.
L255511 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
L255510 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
L255509 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
L255508 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
L255507 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ You know it, Lilly.
L255506 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
L255505 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ You're a thousand percent right!
L255504 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
L255503 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
L255502 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
L255501 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
L255499 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
L255498 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ He's a good kid. A salesman.
L255497 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ See your son, huh? Well, that's nice. A side of you I didn't know, Lilly.
L255496 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
L255495 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ You want a drink?
L255494 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ Oh, thanks, Bobo.
L255493 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.
L255489 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ You'll never shit right again.
L255488 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ Permanent damage.
L255487 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ What's that, Lilly?
L255486 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...
L255485 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ And if you do it wrong?
L255484 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies.
L255482 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.
L255481 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ You mean, the insurance frammis?
L255480 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ You ever hear about the oranges?
L255477 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ I'll loan you a raincoat.
L255476 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ No.
L255475 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
L255474 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ You're calling the shots.
L255473 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ It happened once. With me, that's making a habit of it.
L255472 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ It'll never happen again. I swear.
L255471 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this.
L255469 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ You expect me to buy this?
L255468 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ I never fucked up before, Bobo.
L255467 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ Motherhood.
L255466 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
L255465 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ What the fuck are you doin with a son?
L255464 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ My son was in the hospital --
L255463 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ Your what?
L255462 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ My son --
L255461 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ You wanna talk to me straight up?
L255460 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ Bobo, no, I --
L255459 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
L255458 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ I want to keep my teeth.
L255457 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?
L255456 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not as much as I should have been, but there was a lot of action on those--
L255455 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
L255454 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
L255453 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
L255451 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando.
L255450 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.
L255449 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
L255448 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ Hi, Bobo.
L255904 +++$+++ u1203 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ No problem. My husband gets up the crack of dawn.  It's his kidneys.
L255903 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call.
L255902 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ Fine.
L255901 +++$+++ u1203 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ Right in front of the room.
L255900 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
L255899 +++$+++ u1203 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.
L255898 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ Do you have something around back, facing away from the road?
L255897 +++$+++ u1203 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
L255896 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.
L255895 +++$+++ u1203 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ Oh, everything's the same size, same price.
L255894 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
L255893 +++$+++ u1203 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
L255366 +++$+++ u1203 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ Hah.
L255365 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
L255357 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ I like you, too.
L255356 +++$+++ u1203 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
L255355 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ Roy? He's always crying.
L255354 +++$+++ u1203 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.
L255749 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you?
L255748 +++$+++ u1204 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Demon! Demon! That's why you can walk on it! Demon!
L255746 +++$+++ u1204 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
L255745 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
L255744 +++$+++ u1204 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Can't move.
L255743 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
L255730 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Henry, no!
L255729 +++$+++ u1204 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You ruined me! You destroyed me!
L255699 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ We're not really interested, Henry.
L255698 +++$+++ u1204 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Come take a look. An entire-suite of main-frame computer.
L255697 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
L255696 +++$+++ u1204 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Want a look?
L255680 +++$+++ u1204 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Mister Hebbing, we are talking about breaking the law here, I want to be sure you understand that. No one gets hurt, but the law does get broken.
L255679 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ So here we are!
L255678 +++$+++ u1204 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already...
L255676 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Oh, I know, I know, and you've been wonderful since I was widowed. But Mister Hebbing has--  -- you don't mind my telling him, darling --  -- suffered reverses. If he could...
L255675 +++$+++ u1204 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
L255674 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing --
L255671 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Goody!
L255670 +++$+++ u1204 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money.
L255669 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything.  Wouldn't I, darling?
L255668 +++$+++ u1204 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
L255667 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!
L255666 +++$+++ u1204 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Mary Beth, what we have here, uh...
L255716 +++$+++ u1204 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You brought a case? Good.
L255715 +++$+++ u1206 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ HEBBING +++$+++ I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
L255714 +++$+++ u1204 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Here you are! Two rich people!
L255695 +++$+++ u1204 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ These machines -- They're in here.
L255694 +++$+++ u1206 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ HEBBING +++$+++ Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
L255693 +++$+++ u1204 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
L255692 +++$+++ u1206 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ HEBBING +++$+++ Not much time.
L255691 +++$+++ u1204 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
L255690 +++$+++ u1206 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ HEBBING +++$+++ Well, you've got your information ahead of New York, I see that.
L255689 +++$+++ u1204 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You're right! And this boy tapped into that main link between Tokyo and the New York Stock Exchange. He can give us, when it's really useful, a seven second delay in that movement of information. Do you know what that means?
L255688 +++$+++ u1206 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ HEBBING +++$+++ One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
L255687 +++$+++ u1204 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?
L255685 +++$+++ u1206 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ HEBBING +++$+++ I can keep my mouth shut, Mister Fellowes.
L255684 +++$+++ u1204 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
L255683 +++$+++ u1206 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ HEBBING +++$+++ I certainly hope not.
L255682 +++$+++ u1204 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
L255681 +++$+++ u1206 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ HEBBING +++$+++ Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it?
L255353 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
L255352 +++$+++ u1205 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Yes, yes, but that's --
L255351 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ You know who I work for.
L255350 +++$+++ u1205 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
L255349 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ Well, make it stop!
L255348 +++$+++ u1205 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
L255347 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ What? He's going to be all right!
L255346 +++$+++ u1205 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.
L255293 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
L255292 +++$+++ u1207 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ IRV +++$+++ Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
L255291 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ I know.
L255290 +++$+++ u1207 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ IRV +++$+++ Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
L255289 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
L255288 +++$+++ u1207 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ IRV +++$+++ Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
