L600116 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
L600115 +++$+++ u3282 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ SULLY +++$+++ I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.
L600114 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Very nice.
L600113 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Big time.
L600112 +++$+++ u3282 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ SULLY +++$+++ Stalker, huh?
L600111 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
L600110 +++$+++ u3282 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ SULLY +++$+++ You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
L600109 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Thanks.
L600108 +++$+++ u3282 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ SULLY +++$+++ Here's the info you asked for.
L600107 +++$+++ u3282 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ SULLY +++$+++ You hot shit. Ya look fuckin' pisser.
L600106 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Fucking Sully! Look at you!
L600105 +++$+++ u3282 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ SULLY +++$+++ Healy you dog!
L600940 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.
L600939 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us.
L600914 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Who the hell's Woogie?
L600913 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.
L600711 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're not going to believe this -- well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to -- but I just got beeped for emergency surgery. Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to bail on you.
L600710 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and roses... and I'm really happy. Leave a message. BEEP.
L600678 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call what's- his-face and cancel.
L600677 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
L600629 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Sure.
L600628 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
L600627 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Are you okay?
L600625 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Warren!
L600624 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Urrggghh...
L600615 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Forget it. It was... fun.
L600614 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ How's my stomach taste, she says.  Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like a dog.
L600610 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ You look great.  Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?
L600609 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ All set.
L600595 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Hey, watch your mouth -- she's a great gal. I'm the dumbshit for lying to her.
L600594 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Turn it up, Magda.
L600545 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Huh... that's strange.
L600544 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Fuck!!
L600503 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Nah, really, it was moronic.
L600502 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Come on, what were you going to say?
L600501 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ No, forget it, it was stupid.
L600500 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What?
L600499 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Mary ah, forget it.
L600498 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Well, I'll see ya.
L600497 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I guess.
L600496 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
L600495 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ So...
L600494 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Wow. I thought I was the only one.
L600493 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yeah.
L600492 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ -- Love story of our time.
L600491 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
L600490 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
L600489 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie.
L600488 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Huh. I guess I just wish they made them like they used to. You know, something like The Heartbreak Kid... or Harold and Maude.
L600487 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ A fucking moron.
L600486 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
L600485 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Have you seen it?
L600484 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
L600483 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You're a movie buff?
L600482 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...
L600481 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?
L600480 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...
L600478 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...
L600477 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Lint?
L600476 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
L600475 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ And it doesn't cramp your style?
L600474 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
L600473 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.
L600404 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.
L600403 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ How about -- ?
L600402 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ That...? Vestibule.
L600401 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
L600400 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Deco.
L600399 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Is this one art deco or art nouveau?
L600398 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ We just got here thirty seconds ago. Isn't this stuff great?
L600397 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
L600396 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I know he's around here someplace.
L600395 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.
L600394 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ A surprise?
L600393 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ We will, but first I have a surprise.
L600392 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
L600391 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Here you go.  What's that smell?
L600390 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Fine. Fine.
L600383 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Great.
L600382 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?
L600373 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys.
L600372 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum- tum rubbed, doesn't he now?
L600320 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Look, uh, I was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime.
L600319 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.  Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world.  Ooh, hey, I gotta run.
L600318 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ That sounds like fun.
L600317 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
L600316 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
L600315 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Well it's more of an enclosure really.
L600314 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ -- He's in a cage?!
L600313 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ -- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
L600312 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No, I mean
L600311 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
L600310 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
L600309 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
L600308 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L600307 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ I work with retards.
L600306 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What's that?
L600305 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call me an architect -- it's just a job really, a way to keep me moving. My real passion is my hobby.
L600304 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.
L600303 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Are you... an architect?
L600302 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Some buildings I'm working on.
L600301 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What are you doing with all these blueprints?
L600300 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ It's right there on your golf bag.
L600299 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ How'd you know that?
L600298 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ I already know it, Mary.
L600297 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Don't you want to know my name?
L600296 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Pat Healy.
L600295 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ By the way, what's your name?
L600294 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Same here again.
L600293 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
L600291 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Thanks.
L600290 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.
L600288 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Not 'til you get about three hundred yards from the summit. That's been my experience anyway.
L600287 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
L600286 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
L600285 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You own a home there?
L600284 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
L600283 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Nepal? Have you been?
L600282 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.
L600281 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No thanks.
L600280 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
L600279 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Thanks.
L600278 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.
L600169 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ A girl after your own heart, Ted.
L600168 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy. You can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring at their reflections.
L600885 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.
L600884 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?
L600883 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ What?
L600882 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
L600881 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.
L600880 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
L600879 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ That's right, hot shot! My turn. What's the matter with me, huh? Why can't I ever get the great girl? Give the big pig with the B.O. to Healy, right? Well I was sick of it, man! No more -- it was my turn. It was time for me... time for me... to be happy.
L600878 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Your turn?
L600877 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
L600876 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You're a sick man, you know that?
L600875 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Oh Christ... poor dog.
L600874 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ That's right -- if you weren't you would've looked for her yourself!
L600873 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What?! You're calling me a stalker?
L600872 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Turn her over to a stalker.
L600871 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Do what?
L600870 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
L600868 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Answer the question, shitball.
L600867 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ What do you mean 'why'?
L600866 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?
L600862 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Surprised?
L600861 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Hey, hey, hey!
L600261 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget, it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the pound there. Sort of like tuna.
L600260 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Mary's a mail-order bride?
L600259 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ You've heard of mail-order brides? Well they go that way, too.
L600258 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
L600257 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Okay, tell you what: I'll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from Japan.
L600256 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Oh. I thought  That's not it anyway. I know this doesn't make any sense to you, but I just can't turn it off that fast. I still feel something for her.
L600255 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.
L600254 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ All the same, I still want to call her. I know it sounds crazy -- Mary sure has a lot of troubles in her life -- but, I don't know, maybe I can help her out.  The poor thing's had it tough -- she's in a wheelchair for Godsakes.
L600253 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ I said buttplug. She's heinous.
L600252 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ But you said she was a sparkplug...?
L600251 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
L600250 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
L600249 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Good good.
L600248 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me.
L600247 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.
L600246 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Jai alai?
L600245 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
L600244 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Miami?
L600243 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Oh, uh, I resigned.
L600242 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What are you doing?
L600241 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ You sure, big guy? I'll bet she'd love to hear from you before her mastectomy!
L600240 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Uh, that's okay.
L600239 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
L600238 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Thanks, Healy. Good work.
L600237 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Anyway, the good news is I have all the information you need. Got it from her bookie -- nice guy. You should definitely call her, Ted. I mean she's a real sparkplug, that one. She seems determined to get those rugrats off welfare and with your help I'll bet she does it.
L600236 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
L600235 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
L600234 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ She's in a wheelchair?!
L600233 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
L600232 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Oh my.
L600231 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
L600230 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Three different guys?
L600229 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Four kids, three different guys.
L600228 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Huh?
L600227 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Nope. Never been.

L600225 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds.
L600224 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half. Not bad.
L600223 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Mary's a little chubby, huh?
L600222 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Well she must've packed on a few pounds over the years.

L600220 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
L600219 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ So she hasn't changed?
L600218 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
L600217 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ So you found Mary?

L600101 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
L600100 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
L600099 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
