L374723 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
L374722 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
L374721 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night!  No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterday—here he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!
L374718 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Well, what about it?  Let them see him!  We'll go them one better. They can also hear him.  You own a radio station, Mr. Norton. Why not put him on the air?
L374717 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Yeah, but it's got everybody sore. Ads are being pulled—the Governor's starting a libel suit—what's more, they all know John Doe's a phoney—and they insist on seeing him.
L374621 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Awwwww!
L374620 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
L374619 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ And you! Start pounding that typewriter. Oh, boy! This is terrific!  No responsibilities on our part. Just statements from John Doe and we can blast our heads off.
L374618 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Take it easy, John Doe.
L374617 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Okay, fellows.
L374605 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Well, that's fine. Now I want you to sign this agreement. It gives us an exclusive story under your name day by day from now until Christmas. On December twenty-sixth, you get one railroad ticket out of town, and the Bulletin agrees to pay to have your arm fixed. That's what you want, isn't it?
L374604 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I got it all ready. Here.
L374603 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Well, okay. But we don't want more than a couple o' hundred people in on this thing. Now the first thing I want is an exact copy of the John Doe letter in your own handwriting.
L374598 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh!
L374597 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Duets? But can we trust him?
L374596 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Friend of his. They play duets together.
L374595 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Yes.  What's he doing here?
L374594 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
L374593 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
L374592 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel room—under bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
L374591 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Well, maybe you're right.
L374590 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
L374589 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ But, he's gonna jump off a building!
L374588 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ No, no, no! You can't take pictures of him like that—eating a sandwich—and with a beard!
L374587 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ All right, boys, here he is.
L374576 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Right here. Sit down.
L374575 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh.
L374574 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Hurry up, Pop.
L374572 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ When you're desperate for money, you do a lot of things, Mr. Connell. He's our man, I tell you.
L374571 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
L374570 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ That's our man. He's made to order.
L374561 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ I wish he had a family, though.
L374560 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
L374559 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Looks all right—
L374540 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Packs everything, including a gun.  Okay, sister, you've got yourself a deal. Now let's take a look at the candidates. The one we pick has gotta be the typical average man. Typical American that can keep his mouth shut.
L374539 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
L374538 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
L374537 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Sorry.
L374536 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ I can read. I can read!
L374534 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ What bonus?
L374533 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Plus a bonus.
L374532 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Okay, sister, you get your job back.
L374517 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ That's all, Ned. Thank you.
L374516 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ That's fine! That's fine!  Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this!
L374513 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman.
L374512 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place.
L374508 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Anybody! Er, er—Beany'll do!
L374507 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Who, for instance?
L374506 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Well, you're catching on.
L374505 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Lemme get this through this lame brain of mine. Are you suggesting we go out and hire someone to say he's gonna commit suicide on Christmas Eve? Is that it?
L374504 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!
L374503 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ What John Doe?
L374502 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ John Doe.
L374501 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Very pretty. Very pretty, indeed, Miss Mitchell. But would you mind telling me who goes on Christmas Eve?
L374499 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ So?
L374498 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river!  But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.
L374497 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Sure!  When you get hold of a stunt that sells papers you don't drop it like a hot potato. Why, this is good for at least a couple of months. You know what I'd do? Between now and let's say, Christmas, when he's gonna jump, I'd run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood, his schooling, his first job!  A wide-eyed youngster facing a chaotic world. The problem of the average man, of all the John Does in the world.
L374496 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ A deal?
L374495 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius— Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doe—and he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
L374494 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ What John Doe?
L374493 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ John Doe.
L374492 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ In what man!
L374491 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Well, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!
L374477 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
L374476 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ You made it up.
L374475 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ There is no letter. I made it up.
L374474 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Say that again.
L374473 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ There is no letter.
L374472 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ We'll get a handwriting expert to—  What!
L374471 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ There is no letter.
L374470 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
L374469 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh!
L374468 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ The letter from John Doe.
L374467 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ What letter?
L374466 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ The letter.
L374465 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ What's that?
L374464 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!
L374463 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I remember, distinctly, being fired.
L374462 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ No. I've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day.
L374396 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh, I can do that. I know this town inside out. Oh, give me a chance, please.
L374395 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammers—start arguments.
L374394 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say.
L374387 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
L374386 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.
L375457 +++$+++ u2040 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ Now, that's crazy. It's fourteen floors!
L375456 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh, let me go, will you!
L375455 +++$+++ u2040 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here!
L375454 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh. Gee, you're swell! Oh.
L375453 +++$+++ u2040 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ He's watching the other door.
L375452 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Where's Connell?
L375451 +++$+++ u2040 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ I ain't seen him for a week.
L375450 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Have you seen him?
L375449 +++$+++ u2040 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ No.
L375448 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Has he been here?
L375447 +++$+++ u2040 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
L375446 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Colonel!
L374602 +++$+++ u2040 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ That's—
L374601 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
L374583 +++$+++ u2040 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ Trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. You couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you!
L374582 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Well, nobody asked yuh.
L374581 +++$+++ u2040 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
L374580 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
L374554 +++$+++ u2053 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ TALL CHAP +++$+++ Bush leagues mostly.[5] Med. shot: To include the rest of them. They have their eyes glued on his face. ANN is very much interested.
L374553 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Where'd you play?
L374552 +++$+++ u2053 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ TALL CHAP +++$+++ Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
L374551 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Baseball?
L374550 +++$+++ u2053 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ TALL CHAP +++$+++ I used to pitch.
L374549 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ What do you do when you work?
L374548 +++$+++ u2053 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ TALL CHAP +++$+++ Yeah, a little.
L374547 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Had any schooling?
L375264 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ . . . Tubby?
L375263 +++$+++ u2037 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe!
L375215 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street.
L375214 +++$+++ u2037 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute.
L375211 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.  Say, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight?
L375210 +++$+++ u2037 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ Hey, Boss.
L374614 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Yes, both of 'em! But don't let him out of your sight.
L374613 +++$+++ u2037 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ Both of 'em?
L374612 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L374609 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.
L374608 +++$+++ u2037 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ Yeah, Boss?
L374524 +++$+++ u2037 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.
L374523 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ What do they want?
L374522 +++$+++ u2037 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ Look!
L374521 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ What?
L374520 +++$+++ u2037 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ Hey, boss. Get a load of this.
L374482 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Beany!
L374481 +++$+++ u2037 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ Ann! Say, why didn't yuh—
L374480 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Shut up!
L374479 +++$+++ u2037 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl there—
L374458 +++$+++ u2037 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ Her old man was Doc Mitchell. You know, the doc that saved my mother's life and wouldn't take any money for it? You remember that? Okay, boss, I'll go and look for her.
L374457 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Hello! . . . Yeh?
L374456 +++$+++ u2037 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ Sure. Hey, but the biggest thing I didn't tell you . . .
L374455 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Go out and find her!
L374454 +++$+++ u2037 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
L374453 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Did you find her?
L374452 +++$+++ u2037 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?
L374451 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Where is she?
L374450 +++$+++ u2037 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ I went up to Miss Mitchell's house, boss. Boy, she's in a bad way.
L374877 +++$+++ u2037 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ There you are, Boss, just like you ordered. Symbols of the little people.
L374876 +++$+++ u2040 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ Holy smoke! A half a heelot!
L374794 +++$+++ u2040 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ I know why you're hangin' around—you're stuck on a girl—that's all a guy needs is to get hooked up with a woman.
L374793 +++$+++ u2037 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ St-rike!
L374791 +++$+++ u2040 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ I don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after Christmas.
L374790 +++$+++ u2037 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ Ba-ll!
L374669 +++$+++ u2040 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ All right. You're walking along—not a nickel in your jeans—free as the wind—nobody bothers you—hundreds of people pass yuh by in every line of business—shoes, hats, automobiles, radio, furniture, everything. They're all nice, lovable people, and they let you alone. Is that right?
L374668 +++$+++ u2037 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ Sure. Mostly often.
L374667 +++$+++ u2040 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
L374666 +++$+++ u2037 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ Who are they?
L374665 +++$+++ u2040 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ The heelots!
L374664 +++$+++ u2037 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?
L374660 +++$+++ u2037 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ Hey. Who'd you say was gonna get him?
L374659 +++$+++ u2040 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ And when they get you, you got no more chance than a road-rabbit.
L374652 +++$+++ u2037 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ Who?
L374651 +++$+++ u2040 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ The heelots!
L374650 +++$+++ u2037 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ Who's got him?
L374649 +++$+++ u2040 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  Yes sir, they got you!
L374648 +++$+++ u2037 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ Hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway?
L374642 +++$+++ u2037 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?
L374641 +++$+++ u2040 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ I've seen guys like you go under before. Guys that never had a worry. Then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. The first thing that happens to a guy—
L374637 +++$+++ u2040 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ Naw.
L374636 +++$+++ u2037 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ Help yourself.
L375488 +++$+++ u2039 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BERT'S WIFE +++$+++ What Bert's trying to say is—well—we need you, Mr. Doe. There were a lot of us didn't believe what that man said.
L375487 +++$+++ u2038 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ You don't have to—Why, we're with you, Mr. Doe. We just lost our heads and acted like a mob. Why, we . . .
L375030 +++$+++ u2039 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BERT'S WIFE +++$+++ Just like you said on the radio, Mr. Doe.
L375029 +++$+++ u2038 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Yeah. That's—that's him. Of course, you don't know Grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him. Er, that is until Murphy, the postman told us the truth. "Why, Grubbel," he says, "he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity. Because it'd ruin his self-respect," he says.
L375028 +++$+++ u2039 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BERT'S WIFE +++$+++ Grubbel's here. See? 
L375016 +++$+++ u2038 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Oh, yeah. We made Sourpuss chairman and decided to call ourselves The John Doe Club. And, say, incidentally, this is my wife. Come here, honey.
L375015 +++$+++ u2039 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BERT'S WIFE +++$+++ Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
L375014 +++$+++ u2038 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
L375442 +++$+++ u2038 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
L375441 +++$+++ u2052 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ SOURPUSS +++$+++ That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.
L375386 +++$+++ u2038 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Yeah? Well, you can have it!
L375385 +++$+++ u2052 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ SOURPUSS +++$+++ It makes no difference, Bert—the ideas's still good. We don't have to give up our club.
L375354 +++$+++ u2038 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ A gag. A gag!
L375353 +++$+++ u2052 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ SOURPUSS +++$+++ A what?
L375352 +++$+++ u2038 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ It must be some kind of a gag.
L375351 +++$+++ u2052 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ SOURPUSS +++$+++ How could he be a fake? 
L375042 +++$+++ u2038 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
L375041 +++$+++ u2052 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ SOURPUSS +++$+++ No!
L375032 +++$+++ u2038 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Yeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man Delaney—
L375031 +++$+++ u2052 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ SOURPUSS +++$+++ Well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief!
L375027 +++$+++ u2038 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Yeah, sure. Er, you know Grubbel, for instance.
L375026 +++$+++ u2052 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ SOURPUSS +++$+++ And then we started to find out about a lot of other people.
L375024 +++$+++ u2052 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ SOURPUSS +++$+++ Old man Delaney has been bringing his furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling it.
L375023 +++$+++ u2038 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Well, anyway, I—I guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
L375022 +++$+++ u2052 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ SOURPUSS +++$+++ Th—that's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background.
L375021 +++$+++ u2038 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ This is Sourpuss. Er, excuse me. Er, Mr. Smithers, Mr. Doe.
L374945 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ John Doe Club?
L374944 +++$+++ u2040 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ Join the John Doe Club.
L374936 +++$+++ u2040 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ Yeh.
L374935 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Better make it doughnuts, huh?
L374934 +++$+++ u2040 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ Four bits.
L374933 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
L374932 +++$+++ u2040 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.
L374930 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Five thousand bucks!  I had it right in my hand!
L374929 +++$+++ u2040 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
L374928 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
L374927 +++$+++ u2040 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from her.
L374823 +++$+++ u2040 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ The elevators are still runnin'.
