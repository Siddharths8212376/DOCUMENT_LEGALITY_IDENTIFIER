L169244 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.
L169243 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Congratulations.
L169242 +++$+++ u783 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I got in. I'm going to Harvard.
L168987 +++$+++ u783 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ That's a nice name.  OK, let me see it.
L168986 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Her name is Gretchen.
L168985 +++$+++ u783 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
L168984 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I was just being honest.
L168983 +++$+++ u783 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
L168982 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
L168981 +++$+++ u783 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ No I don't.  She worries about you.
L168980 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Because you tell Mom everything.
L168979 +++$+++ u783 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Why would I tell Mom?
L168978 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
L168977 +++$+++ u783 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ What's her name?
L168976 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L168975 +++$+++ u783 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ So I hear you have a girlfriend.
L168920 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Guess who wrote it?
L168919 +++$+++ u783 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
L168918 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ It's called "The Philosophy of Time Travel".
L168579 +++$+++ u783 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
L168578 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
L169035 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Well, I think you're the fucking Anti-Christ.
L169034 +++$+++ u786 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ JIM CUNNINGHAM +++$+++ I think you are afraid to ask me for advice. I think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. I think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places.
L169032 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Well, Jim, I think you're full of shit!
L169031 +++$+++ u786 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ JIM CUNNINGHAM +++$+++ Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
L169030 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Gerald.
L169029 +++$+++ u786 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ JIM CUNNINGHAM +++$+++ Excuse me? What's your name, son?
L169028 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ How much are they paying you to be here?
L169003 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
L169002 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ If that's what you think is necessary.
L169001 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication.
L169000 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I... What can we do?
L168999 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ He has described lengthy conversations... physical encounters with what I believe to be a manifestation of his subconscious mind.
L168998 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
L168997 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
L168996 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Frank?
L168995 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
L168994 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Come again?
L168993 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ Has your son ever told you about Frank?
L168990 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, you know about his past. And when you said to look for signs of aggression... He was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher.
L168989 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ What I think is going on with your son.
L168988 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...
L168642 +++$+++ u782 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed.
L168641 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ He was a year ahead of us?
L168640 +++$+++ u782 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
L168639 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What?
L168633 +++$+++ u782 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
L168632 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
L168602 +++$+++ u782 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You're not a bitch.
L168601 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Our son just called me a bitch.
L169163 +++$+++ u783 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
L169162 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
L168594 +++$+++ u783 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I caught him flushing pills down the toilet. He knows you check the container.
L168593 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ It is a big deal.
L168592 +++$+++ u783 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
L168591 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ How did you know --
L168590 +++$+++ u783 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?
L168586 +++$+++ u783 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ You can suck a fuck.
L168585 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ That's enough.
L168584 +++$+++ u783 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Did you just call me a fuck-ass?
L168577 +++$+++ u783 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Donnie? You're a dick.
L168576 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Excuse me?
L168573 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed.
L168572 +++$+++ u783 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I haven't been accepted yet, mother.
L168734 +++$+++ u787 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ LEROY +++$+++ I guess they made him do it.
L168733 +++$+++ u790 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLE +++$+++ How did this happen?
L168732 +++$+++ u787 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ LEROY +++$+++ Yep.
L168731 +++$+++ u790 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLE +++$+++ Christ. Is that an axe?
L168730 +++$+++ u787 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ LEROY +++$+++ What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't gonna believe what else.
L168729 +++$+++ u790 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLE +++$+++ What else?
L168728 +++$+++ u787 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ LEROY +++$+++ I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.
L169153 +++$+++ u788 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. FARMER +++$+++ Rose... I don't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters. This has been a dream of ours for a long time.  Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion.
L169152 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
L169151 +++$+++ u788 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. FARMER +++$+++ Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
L169150 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ But now you can't go.
L169149 +++$+++ u788 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. FARMER +++$+++ Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
L169148 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Beg pardon?
L169147 +++$+++ u788 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. FARMER +++$+++ Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
L169146 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
L169145 +++$+++ u788 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. FARMER +++$+++ Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
L169144 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Kitty...
L169143 +++$+++ u788 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. FARMER +++$+++ Rose.
L168899 +++$+++ u788 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. FARMER +++$+++ Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.
L168898 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.
L168862 +++$+++ u788 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. FARMER +++$+++ I think we've all seen "Bonanza".
L168861 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Do you even know who Graham Greene is?
L168858 +++$+++ u788 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. FARMER +++$+++ The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
L168857 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
L168848 +++$+++ u788 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. FARMER +++$+++ I AM THE PTA! And I say that this FILTH is directly related to this vandalism.
L168847 +++$+++ u790 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLE +++$+++ This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
L168846 +++$+++ u788 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. FARMER +++$+++ And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!
L168844 +++$+++ u788 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. FARMER +++$+++ The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour.
L168843 +++$+++ u790 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLE +++$+++ Kitty...
L168842 +++$+++ u788 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. FARMER +++$+++ Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
L168841 +++$+++ u790 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLE +++$+++ Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait...
L169248 +++$+++ u791 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ I stole four beers from my dad.
L169247 +++$+++ u794 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
L168821 +++$+++ u791 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Not Vanity. He's a homo.
L168820 +++$+++ u794 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
L168819 +++$+++ u791 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Smurfette doesn't fuck.
L168818 +++$+++ u794 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ No more fuckin' for her.
L168817 +++$+++ u791 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Wicked.
L168815 +++$+++ u794 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Raspberry.
L168814 +++$+++ u791 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ What is this shit?
L168720 +++$+++ u791 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.
L168719 +++$+++ u794 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.
L168717 +++$+++ u794 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home.
L168716 +++$+++ u791 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ There's no rule!
L168715 +++$+++ u794 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
L168714 +++$+++ u791 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.
L168660 +++$+++ u794 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Go back to China, bitch!
L168659 +++$+++ u791 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Chut up!
L171359 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ I'm gonna be on TV! Just like Diane Sawyer.
L171358 +++$+++ u810 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
L171357 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
L171306 +++$+++ u810 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
L171305 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ I gotta work with these women.
L171304 +++$+++ u810 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
L171303 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ Loretta, don't do that.
L171302 +++$+++ u810 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I got it! Yeah, why don't ya take a...
L171301 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ Airport Ho-Jo!
L171300 +++$+++ u810 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
L171298 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh!
L171297 +++$+++ u810 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
L171296 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
L171295 +++$+++ u810 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
L171294 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!
L171293 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!
L171292 +++$+++ u810 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ This came for you, sweetie.
L171291 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.
L171290 +++$+++ u810 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'.
L171289 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ Okay.
L171288 +++$+++ u810 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
L171287 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ Really?
L171286 +++$+++ u810 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
L171285 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
L171284 +++$+++ u810 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ What is wrong with you?
L171217 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ ...Yah -- well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me.  I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer...
L171216 +++$+++ u810 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Thank God for bunge cords.
L171215 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
L171066 +++$+++ u810 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could.
L171065 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ Loretta, never have kids.
L171064 +++$+++ u810 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
L171063 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ My mom wanted me to have this?
L171062 +++$+++ u810 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ You-betcha.
L171061 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ Really, Loretta?
L171060 +++$+++ u810 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
L171008 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ Oh-yah.
L171007 +++$+++ u810 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ "Once a carnie, always a carnie."
L171004 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
L171003 +++$+++ u810 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
L170984 +++$+++ u810 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Yeah, you betcha...
L170983 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ Oh my God. I'm so dead...
L170982 +++$+++ u810 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
L170981 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ So, what do I say?
L170978 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ Oh God, I'm dead...
L170977 +++$+++ u810 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
L170976 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
L170975 +++$+++ u810 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ You're what?!
L170961 +++$+++ u810 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Don't let that worry you, Annette!
L170960 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
L170959 +++$+++ u810 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ She's right over there.
L170958 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ Where is she?!
L170957 +++$+++ u810 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ She's alive, sweetie.
L170956 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ Is Mom okay?
L171169 +++$+++ u809 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Oh-you-beccha.
L171168 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ Yah?
L171167 +++$+++ u809 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
L171166 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
L171165 +++$+++ u809 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
L171164 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ Your parents'd kill you.
L171163 +++$+++ u809 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.
L171160 +++$+++ u809 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ My jacket. Take it 'cause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it.
L171159 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ "Here," wh-wh-what?
L171158 +++$+++ u809 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Amber? Here.
L171157 +++$+++ u809 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I can't believe this is happenin'. I can't believe she said you couldn't...
