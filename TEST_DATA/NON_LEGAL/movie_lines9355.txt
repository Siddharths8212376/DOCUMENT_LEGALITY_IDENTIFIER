L465781 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ The cops were there waitin' for us!
L465780 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What? Nobody set anybody up.
L465779 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ We were set up, the cops were waiting for us.
L465909 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
L465908 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ Tell me more about Cabot.
L465887 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ The things you gotta remember are the details. It's the details that sell your story. Now this story takes place in this men's room. So you gotta know the details about this men's room. You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands. You gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors. You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it. And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you.
L465886 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I can do that.
L465885 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it.
L465884 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I gotta memorize all this shit?
L465883 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
L465882 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ What?
L465881 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
L465880 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ But what is this?
L465879 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
L465878 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ What?
L465877 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ It's a scene. Memorize it.
L465876 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ What's this?
L465875 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too.
L465874 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ Didja use the commode story?
L465872 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.
L465871 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
L465870 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin. And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I- know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face.
L465869 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
L465868 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ The Milwaukee Brewers?
L465867 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ The Brewers.
L465866 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ What about?
L465865 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ A little.
L465864 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ Yeah.
L465863 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Me and Mr. White?
L465862 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ Did the two of you talk?
L465861 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
L465860 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ How can you tell?
L465859 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.
L465858 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ Yeah.
L465857 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Who, Mr. White?
L465856 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ You ever seen this motherfucker before?
L465855 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
L465854 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ ...What bar?
L465853 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...
L465848 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ This better not be some Freddy joke.
L465847 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?
L465985 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed me...
L465984 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Just hold on buddy boy.
L465981 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ What? Snap out of it!
L465980 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L465974 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ When you're dealing with a store like this, they're insured up the ass. They're not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever. If you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's Charles Bronson, take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in. Drops 'em right to the floor. Everyone jumps, he falls down, screaming, blood squirts out his nose. Freaks everybody out. Nobody says fuckin' shit after that. You might get some bitch talk shit to ya. But give her a look, like you're gonna smash her in the face next. Watch her shut the fuck up. Now if it's a manager, that's a different story. The managers know better than to fuck around. So if one's givin' you static, he probably thinks he's a real cowboy. So what you gotta do is break that son-of-a-bitch in two. If you wanna know something and he won't tell you, cut off one of his fingers. The little one. Then you tell 'im his thumb's next. After that he'll tell ya if he wears ladies underwear. I'm hungry, let's get a taco.
L465973 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
L465972 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Myself and Mr. Pink?
L465971 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area.
L465970 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
L465969 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
L465968 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Mr. Brown?
L465967 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
L465966 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Let's go over it. Where are you?
L465947 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ You can do some crazy things with it.
L465946 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Jesus Christ!
L465892 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Traffic tickets gone to warrant. They stopped him for something, found the warrants on 'im, took 'im to jail. She doesn't want to walk around alone with all that weed. Well, I don't wanna do this, I have a bad feeling about it, but she keeps askin' me, keeps askin' me, finally I said okay 'cause I'm sick of listening to it. Well, we're picking this guy up at the train station.
L465891 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ What for?
L465890 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ ...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
L465765 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Well, it's kinda a strange time right now. Things are kinda -
L465764 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.  When do you think you'll need me for real work?
L465729 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ Well, what I wanna do is go back to work. But I got this Scagnetti prick deep up my ass. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job. My plans have always been to be part of the team again.
L465728 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
L465727 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
L465726 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
L465725 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside.
L465724 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Never ceases to amaze me. Fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there, slits some old woman's throat for twenty- five cents. Fuckin' nigger gets Doris Day as a parole officer. But a good fella like you gets stuck with a ball-bustin' prick.
L465723 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.
L465722 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ How is he?
L465721 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
L465720 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Who's your parole officer?
L465719 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Take a seat.
L465718 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ Sure.
L465717 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
L465716 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ It's a change.
L465715 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?
L465418 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You know, like the Chinese name?
L465417 +++$+++ u2615 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BROWN +++$+++ Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
L465416 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Wong?
L465415 +++$+++ u2615 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BROWN +++$+++ It hurts. It hurts her. It shouldn't hurt. Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now. But when this cat fucks her, it hurts. It hurts like the first time. The pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin. Hence, "Like a Virgin."
L465414 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Chew? Toby Chew? No.
L465413 +++$+++ u2615 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BROWN +++$+++ Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape." He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's gettin' this serious dick action, she's feelin' something she ain't felt since forever. Pain.
L465405 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl.
L465404 +++$+++ u2615 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BROWN +++$+++ Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a point here. You're gonna make me lose my train of thought.
L465398 +++$+++ u2615 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BROWN +++$+++ It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.
L465397 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...
L466016 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Dead as Dillinger.
L466015 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Mr. Blue's dead?
L465964 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on.
L465963 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
L465960 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink.
L465959 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy. Tell you what, let me be Mr. Purple. That sounds good to me, I'm Mr. Purple.
L465957 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I tried that once, it don't work. You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since nobody knows anybody else, nobody wants to back down. So forget it, I pick. Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.
L465956 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Why can't we pick out our own colors?
L465955 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Cause you're a faggot, alright?
L465954 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Why am I Mr. Pink?
L465953 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he wouldn't be here. Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name...  ...you won't want to be you. Okay, quickly.  Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink.
L465495 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Whatever. Just throw in your dollar, and let's move.  See what I'm dealing with here. Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with infants.
L465494 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.
L466032 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm not askin', I'm betting.
L466031 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Don't ask me that.
L466030 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
L466029 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
L466028 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
L466026 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next!
L466025 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much.
L466021 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You don't need proof when you got instinct. I ignored it before, but not no more.
L466020 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ That's your proof?
L466019 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up.
L466014 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You don't know jack shit. I do. This rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.
L466013 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
L466012 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Like hell I am.
L466011 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.
L466006 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
L466005 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ What the fuck are you talking about?
L465615 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Juicy, junior, real juicy.
L465614 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ What's the cut, poppa?
L465613 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ No, they're not.
L465612 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
L465611 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ How many employees?
L465610 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
L465609 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
L465608 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What for?
L465607 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
L465606 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
L465605 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice.
L465604 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
L465603 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.
L465602 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What's she doin' now?
L465450 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Blonde, shoot this piece of shit, will ya?
L465449 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Sorry, it's my book now.
L465448 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.
L465442 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Who gives a damn?
L465441 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No, she did it. She killed the cheatin' wife, too.
L465429 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it.
L465428 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
L465427 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ You gonna put it away?
L465426 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Give me my book.
L465425 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
L465424 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What do you care?
L465423 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left.
L465422 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
L465421 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
L465420 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
L465419 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Give me this fucking thing.
L465407 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. Toby what? What the fuck was her last name?
L465406 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ What's that?
L466010 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.
L466009 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Aren't you?
L465493 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Shut up!  Cough up the buck, ya cheap bastard, I paid for your goddamn breakfast.
L465492 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ Nope.
L465491 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
L465490 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ He don't believe in it.

L465488 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ He don't tip.
L465487 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Mr. Pink?  Why?
L465486 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ Mr. Pink.
L465485 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
L465846 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ And I'm dying. They don't know that. All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I was sent undercover to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they said he's on his way. Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin. We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.
L465845 +++$+++ u2613 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MARVIN +++$+++ What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
L465844 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
L465843 +++$+++ u2613 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MARVIN +++$+++ That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard!
L465841 +++$+++ u2613 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MARVIN +++$+++ I do.  How do I look?
L465840 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ Shit. I don't remember that at all.
L465839 +++$+++ u2613 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MARVIN +++$+++ Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
L465838 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ Freddy Newendyke.
L465837 +++$+++ u2613 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MARVIN +++$+++ Your name's Freddy something.
L465836 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ You do?

L465815 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ I don't like alarms.
L465814 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
L465813 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ I told 'em not to touch the alarm. They touched it. I blew 'em full of holes. If they hadn't done what I told 'em not it, they'd still be alive.
L465810 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ He's the reason the place turned into a shooting gallery.  What are you, a silent partner? Fuckin' tell him.
L465809 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."
L465808 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard.
L465708 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look at the little surprise I brought you.
L465707 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
L465706 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ You didn't ask.
L465705 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?
L465702 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ Nice Guy Eddie.
L465701 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ For what, the cops?
L465698 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ It's a surprise.

L465696 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ Down to my car.
L465695 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Follow you where?
L465686 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ I said: "Are you gonna bark all day, dog, or are you gonna bite."
L465685 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
L465684 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
L465683 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
L465682 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
L465681 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
L465680 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ What're you talkin' about?
L465679 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
L465678 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ What's this guy's problem?
L465668 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ We think we got a rat in the house.
L465667 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ So, talk.
L465431 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
L465430 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
L465993 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.
L465992 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.
