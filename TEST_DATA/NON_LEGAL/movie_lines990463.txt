L627718 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.
L627713 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.  What do you think would taste good?
L627712 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs.
L627697 +++$+++ u8639 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DREXL +++$+++ In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D, toss me that shotgun.
L627696 +++$+++ u8632 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ BIG D +++$+++ I'm hip.
L627689 +++$+++ u8639 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DREXL +++$+++ Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.
L627688 +++$+++ u8632 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ BIG D +++$+++ Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -
L627684 +++$+++ u8632 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ BIG D +++$+++ Me thinketh he doth protest too much.
L627683 +++$+++ u8639 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DREXL +++$+++ Damn skippy. He like it, too.
L627674 +++$+++ u8639 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DREXL +++$+++ Heard that.
L627673 +++$+++ u8632 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ BIG D +++$+++ Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.
L627668 +++$+++ u8639 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DREXL +++$+++ I heard that.
L627667 +++$+++ u8632 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ BIG D +++$+++ Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
L627666 +++$+++ u8639 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DREXL +++$+++ Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
L627665 +++$+++ u8632 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ BIG D +++$+++ What the fuck are you talkin' about?
L627692 +++$+++ u8632 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ BIG D +++$+++ Take that shit somewhere else.
L627691 +++$+++ u8642 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Ain't no man have to eat pussy!
L627682 +++$+++ u8632 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ BIG D +++$+++ You don't like it, but you eat that shit.  He eats it.
L627681 +++$+++ u8642 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Naw naw!
L627680 +++$+++ u8632 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ BIG D +++$+++ So you do eat pussy!
L627679 +++$+++ u8642 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Go on pussy-eaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got pussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to do a bunch of fucked-up shit.
L627670 +++$+++ u8632 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ BIG D +++$+++ Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang.
L627669 +++$+++ u8642 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?
L628603 +++$+++ u8641 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELVIS +++$+++ That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that.
L628602 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
L628601 +++$+++ u8641 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELVIS +++$+++ You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.
L628600 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?
L628599 +++$+++ u8641 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELVIS +++$+++ Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
L628598 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
L628581 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.
L628580 +++$+++ u8641 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELVIS +++$+++ Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
L628579 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
L628578 +++$+++ u8641 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELVIS +++$+++ All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.
L628577 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
L628576 +++$+++ u8641 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELVIS +++$+++ Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
L628093 +++$+++ u8641 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELVIS +++$+++ Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.
L628092 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ If I thought I could get away with it -
L628091 +++$+++ u8641 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELVIS +++$+++ I don't blame you.
L628090 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
L628089 +++$+++ u8641 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELVIS +++$+++ He don't got no right to live.
L628088 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ You'd really do that?
L628087 +++$+++ u8641 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELVIS +++$+++ I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.
L628086 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
L628085 +++$+++ u8641 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELVIS +++$+++ Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
L628084 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Yeah.
L628083 +++$+++ u8641 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELVIS +++$+++ You wanna get unhaunted?
L628082 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Yeah.
L628081 +++$+++ u8641 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELVIS +++$+++ With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?
L628080 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Live with what?
L628079 +++$+++ u8641 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELVIS +++$+++ Can you live with it?
L628078 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ What?
L628136 +++$+++ u8639 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DREXL +++$+++ Fuck you! My mother was Apache.
L628135 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Wannabee nigger...
L628125 +++$+++ u8639 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DREXL +++$+++ No thanks? What does that mean? Means you ate before you came down here? All full. Is that it? Naw, I don't think so. I think you're too scared to be eatin'. Now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've already given up your shit. I'm still a mystery to you. But I know exactly where your ass is comin' from. See, if I asked you if you wanted some dinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, I'd say to myself, "This motherfucker's carryin' on like he ain't got a care in the world. Who know? Maybe he don't. Maybe this fool's such a bad motherfucker, he don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my Chinese, watch my TV." See? You ain't even sat down yet. On that TV there, since you been in the room, is a woman with her titties hangin' out, and you ain't even bothered to look. You just been starin' at me. Now, I know I'm pretty, but I ain't as pretty as a couple of titties.
L628124 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ No thanks.
L628123 +++$+++ u8639 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DREXL +++$+++ Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.
L628115 +++$+++ u8639 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DREXL +++$+++ Well. That makes us practically related. Bring your ass on in.
L628114 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I'm her husband.
L628113 +++$+++ u8639 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DREXL +++$+++ Who the fuck are you?
L628112 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ She's with me.
L628111 +++$+++ u8639 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DREXL +++$+++ Where the fuck is that bitch?
L628551 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.
L628550 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ No. But thanks.
L628456 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Yeah, let's just get outta here.
L628455 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
L628452 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ This is our last chance to play "what if". I want to do it. I'm just scared of getting caught.
L628451 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Now's a helluva time to play "what if".
L628448 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?
L628447 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Do you really mean it?
L628445 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I know that Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a gun and not to have it.
L628444 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -
L628443 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?
L628442 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ In case of what?
L628441 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ In case.
L628440 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ What the fuck did you bring that for.
L628417 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Um, nothing, let's go?
L628416 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Yeah?
L628415 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Clarence.
L628414 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late.
L628413 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning.
L628412 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ No shit? Dick, that's great!
L628411 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ I got the part on "T.J. Hooker".
L628406 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I'm just makin' sure we got everything.  You got yours?
L628405 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass.  Come on, Clarence, lets go. Elliot's going to meet us in the lobby.
L628234 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Let me handle this.
L628233 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Clarence...
L628206 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'.
L628205 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
L628204 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Two guys.
L628203 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.
L628202 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ What's to think about?
L628201 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
L628200 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ The zoo.  What are you waiting for?
L628199 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ The zoo.
L628198 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Where?
L628197 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
L628196 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Elliot Blitzer.
L628195 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Elliot what?
L628194 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Elliot.
L628193 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ What's this acting class guy's name?
L628192 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.
L628191 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ What'd'ya tell 'em?
L628190 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
L628189 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Is he big league?
L628188 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
L628187 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
L628186 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
L628185 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
L628184 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
L628183 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set.
L628182 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Look, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine.
L628181 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?
L628180 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ This is Drexl's coke?
L628179 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ I don't know! A fuckin' lot!
L628178 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Tell me.
L628177 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
L628176 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I know.
L628175 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
L628174 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I certainly hope so.
L628173 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ It's fuckin' real!  It's fuckin' real!
L628170 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ It'll get ya high.
L628169 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ This shit can't be real.
L627903 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ For the very first time in my life.  Do you know what that's like?
L627902 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ You're really in love, aren't you?
L627901 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Every word of it.
L627900 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ How much of that letter was on the up and up?
L627897 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ You don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope.
L627896 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Did you meet Captain Kirk?
L627895 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ ... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.
L627892 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ What's so fuckin' good about it? Actresses are the most fucked-in-the-head bunch of women in the world. It's like they gotta pass a test of emotional instability before they can get their SAG card. Oh, guess what? I had a really good reading for "T.J. Hooker" the other day.
L627891 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Good for you.
L627890 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
L627889 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ You goin' out?
L627888 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
L627887 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
L627886 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ That's a pretty amazing story.
L627845 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Now tell him goodbye.
L627844 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Money problems?
L627830 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Has he gotten his mail today?
L627829 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Clarence sent a letter?
L627823 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Ask him if he got the letter.
L627822 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Alabama, could you tell Clar -
L627817 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
L627816 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ What?
L627810 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Believe it or not, I actually tricked a girl into falling in love with me. I'm not quite sure how I did it. I'd hate to have to do it again. But I did it. Wanna say hi to my better half?
L627809 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Get the fuck outta here!
L627808 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I'm a married man.
L627807 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Get the fuck outta here!
L627806 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way, I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.
L627805 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ What's up? Why're leavin' Detroit?
L627804 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Tomorrow.
L627803 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ You comin' to L.A.? When?
L627802 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
L627801 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ It's great to hear from you.
L627800 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ You got it.
L627799 +++$+++ u8637 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Clarence?
L627658 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Three kung fu movies.
L627657 +++$+++ u8647 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
L627656 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
L627655 +++$+++ u8647 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Who's Sonny Chiba?
L627654 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter".
L627653 +++$+++ u8647 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ What are we gonna see?
L627652 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
L627651 +++$+++ u8647 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ How 'bout me what?
L627650 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?
L627649 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
L627648 +++$+++ u8647 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
L627647 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Really?
L627646 +++$+++ u8647 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ I'd fuck Elvis.
L628489 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ What's waiting for us up there. Tell me or I'll pump two right in your face.
L628488 +++$+++ u8640 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ No. No you're not.
L628487 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
L628486 +++$+++ u8640 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ You are the dumbest person in the world.
L628485 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Say it, goddamn it!
L628482 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Don't lie to me, motherfucker. You apparently think I'm the dumbest motherfucker in the world! Don't you? Say: Clarence, you are without a doubt, the dumbest motherfucker in the whole wide world. Say it!
L628481 +++$+++ u8640 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ No.
L628480 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Don't you?
L628470 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Get on your knees.
L628469 +++$+++ u8640 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Yeah?
L628468 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Elliot.
L628467 +++$+++ u8640 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ I guess so. Follow me.
L628466 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Well, I guess it's about that time.
L628463 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ They'll be along.
L628462 +++$+++ u8640 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Where's everybody else?
L628266 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ No problems on both counts.
L628265 +++$+++ u8640 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there.  He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.
L628264 +++$+++ u8640 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Mr. Donowitz?  I told you, through Dick.  He's in my acting class.  About a year.  Yeah, he's good.  They grew up together.  Sure thing.
L628263 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ He wants to talk ya.
L628236 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not puttin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But, don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some guts.
L628235 +++$+++ u8640 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're dependable. And, they're safe.
L628232 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
L628231 +++$+++ u8640 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ No. No, you don't.
L628230 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?
L628229 +++$+++ u8640 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ What?
L628227 +++$+++ u8640 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Sure. I didn't hear anything.
L628226 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.
L628225 +++$+++ u8640 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ He trusts you?
L628224 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
L628223 +++$+++ u8640 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ The police department?
