L154244 +++$+++ u756 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ SKETCHY +++$+++ She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
L154243 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ A toy?
L154242 +++$+++ u756 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ SKETCHY +++$+++ I'm a toy to her.
L154241 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
L154240 +++$+++ u756 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ SKETCHY +++$+++ Lydia.
L154239 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Does this person have a name?
L154238 +++$+++ u756 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ SKETCHY +++$+++ She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
L154237 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
L154236 +++$+++ u756 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ SKETCHY +++$+++ Exactly.
L154235 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ And you were a sympathetic ear.
L154234 +++$+++ u756 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ SKETCHY +++$+++ Hear me out.  This person I've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married--
L154233 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Really?
L154232 +++$+++ u756 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ SKETCHY +++$+++ I'm the victim here.
L154231 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
L154230 +++$+++ u756 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ SKETCHY +++$+++ But there's another side--
L154229 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You left out condescending.
L154228 +++$+++ u756 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ SKETCHY +++$+++ Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
L154227 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
L154226 +++$+++ u756 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ SKETCHY +++$+++ Max--
L154225 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
L154224 +++$+++ u756 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ SKETCHY +++$+++ I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
L154223 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I don't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me.
L154221 +++$+++ u756 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ SKETCHY +++$+++ Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off... I need your help, Max.
L154220 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh.  I'd be pissed off too if I was her.
L154218 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What's up?
L154217 +++$+++ u756 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ SKETCHY +++$+++ We gotta talk.
L154216 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Hey, Sketchy--
L154030 +++$+++ u756 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ SKETCHY +++$+++ But I'll take a rain check...
L154029 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Right, the big one-oh.
L154028 +++$+++ u756 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ SKETCHY +++$+++ I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
L154027 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?
L154018 +++$+++ u756 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ SKETCHY +++$+++ Later.
L154017 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Catch you back at the wall.
L154521 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Theo's dead.
L154520 +++$+++ u754 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ NORMAL +++$+++ Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.
L154332 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
L154331 +++$+++ u754 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ NORMAL +++$+++ What about this?
L154330 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
L154329 +++$+++ u754 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ NORMAL +++$+++ Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
L153998 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
L153997 +++$+++ u754 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ NORMAL +++$+++ You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
L153996 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
L153995 +++$+++ u754 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ NORMAL +++$+++ For a change.
L153994 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ He's sick.
L153993 +++$+++ u754 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ NORMAL +++$+++ And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
L153992 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
L153991 +++$+++ u754 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ NORMAL +++$+++ More like deployed in bed asleep.
L153990 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
L153989 +++$+++ u754 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ NORMAL +++$+++ I want you on call here.
L153988 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I was on call. 
L153987 +++$+++ u754 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ NORMAL +++$+++ This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
L163309 +++$+++ u761 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer.
L163308 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me.
L163270 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
L163269 +++$+++ u761 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
L163268 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ And he loves you back, doesn't he?
L163267 +++$+++ u761 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ More than anything in the world.
L163266 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ No, I mean... you love your son?
L163265 +++$+++ u761 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
L163264 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ You love him?
L163263 +++$+++ u761 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.
L163262 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?
L163259 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw...
L163258 +++$+++ u761 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.
L163257 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Who's Whiskey Dick?
L163256 +++$+++ u761 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
L163255 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.
L163254 +++$+++ u761 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Gin.
L163253 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ What the hell is that?
L163191 +++$+++ u761 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
L163190 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Huh?
L163189 +++$+++ u761 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
L163188 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
L163187 +++$+++ u761 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
L163186 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Thanks, miss.
L163145 +++$+++ u762 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ Look, people undress in public because, A, they're exhibitionists, B, they're nutcases, or C, they need the money. I can tell you're not A, and I hope to hell you're not B. So my suggestion is, think about why you're a C and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more.
L163144 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ I-I c-can't...
L163143 +++$+++ u762 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
L163142 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
L163089 +++$+++ u762 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.
L163088 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Whoa... she is a killer.
L163087 +++$+++ u762 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
L163086 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.
L163085 +++$+++ u762 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?
L163084 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ What's that?
L163081 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Yeah, a man's drink...
L163080 +++$+++ u762 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
L163079 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Got any KISS?
L163078 +++$+++ u762 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ Pick a song, Hawk.
L163077 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Hawk.
L163076 +++$+++ u762 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?
L163307 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Bye.
L163306 +++$+++ u763 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
L163305 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Tell me about it. Church will never be the same again.
L163304 +++$+++ u763 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
L163303 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted.
L163302 +++$+++ u763 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?
L163301 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
L163300 +++$+++ u763 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?
L163221 +++$+++ u763 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.
L163220 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Ann Arbor?
L163219 +++$+++ u763 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ I have all your notebook doodles memorized, Jam... Here.
L163218 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?
L163217 +++$+++ u763 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
L163216 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
L163215 +++$+++ u763 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? Y'know, to make it so long?
L163182 +++$+++ u763 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Oh, screw it!
L163181 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Right, slow...
L163180 +++$+++ u763 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ We've got to take this slow...
L163179 +++$+++ u763 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ You don't know how long I've been waiting to hear that... Jam!
L163178 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
L163177 +++$+++ u763 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it.
L163176 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ I don't care. I wanna hear more.
L163175 +++$+++ u763 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
L163172 +++$+++ u763 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Believe it.
L163171 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Beth? I can't believe it.
L162700 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Yeah?
L162699 +++$+++ u763 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Jeremiah?
L162698 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ It's okay.
L162697 +++$+++ u763 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Sorry.
L162690 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Thanks.
L162689 +++$+++ u763 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ No problem.
L162945 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ Whatever... stella.
L162944 +++$+++ u764 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
L162943 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ You got in the car, didn't you?
L162942 +++$+++ u764 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?
L162939 +++$+++ u764 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ What? That's disgusting!
L162938 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?
L162933 +++$+++ u764 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ What the hell is that supposed to mean?
L162932 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ What's it worth to you?
L162931 +++$+++ u764 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there?
L163339 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ Plenty, but it was all bad.
L163338 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Any luck?
L163034 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ For the next hour and a half it's every dude for himself. Try to get at least one ticket and at 8:30 P.M. we'll meet over there.
L163033 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ One more time in English.
L163032 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ ...at twenty-thirty hours.
L163027 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Brilliance, Trip. Sheer brilliance. Give Albert Einstein here the Nobel Prize.
L163026 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
L163025 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck!
L162998 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf?
L162997 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?
L162971 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
L162970 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ What was that D.J.'s name again?
L162953 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ Disco blows dogs for quarters.
L162952 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me.
L162864 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ Pizza, and I been jones-in' for a pizza ever since we left St. Bernard's.
L162863 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ What's in Sandusky?
L162862 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.
L162861 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.
L162860 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.
L162791 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ I was just explaining to Lex here what you and I already know. Just had to make it a little more complicated so he'd understand.
L162790 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
L162789 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.
L162775 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.
L162774 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ Namely?
L162770 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.
L162769 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.
L162750 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
L162749 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
L162721 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ For once Lex is right. It's over. Things can't get any worse from here.
L162720 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ Yeah.
L162719 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ What are you, high?
L163346 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Nah. Couldn't be.
L163345 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ No... You don't think...?
L163341 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Tickets?
L163340 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ I found the Volvo.
L163031 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Still too risky for my money.  We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection...
L163030 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
L163029 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
L163028 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ I think we should try sneaking in.
L163020 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Okay, shut the fuck up, Lex! Now, then, step number one, we find us a scalper. I got...  twenty-five.
L163019 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ ...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
L163018 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Cool, bro, now listen up...
L163017 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ ...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
L163016 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
L163015 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.
L163014 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.
L163003 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ DUDES!
L163002 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
L163001 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Uh... dudes?
L162875 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ The paint!
L162874 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ What the fuck!
L162859 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed.
L162858 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?
L162855 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
L162854 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.
L162820 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
L162819 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Now, how are we gonna do this?
L162795 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
L162794 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
L162793 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Curly.
L162792 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.
L162788 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Well, Jam is in absolute trouble. He couldn't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse's ass. You know as well as me he'd give his right arm just to see Peter Criss's drum solo, never mind a whole KISS concert, check?
L162787 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
L162786 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?
L162783 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.
L162782 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Sunday, but...
L162781 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
L162780 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
L162779 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Damn straight we are.
