L305327 +++$+++ u6008 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Where's your back-up?
L305304 +++$+++ u6008 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ If you want it to be...
L305303 +++$+++ u6009 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ This an accident, Walter?
L305302 +++$+++ u6008 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Yes.  Like that.
L305300 +++$+++ u6008 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
L305299 +++$+++ u6009 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Couldn't get it up, Walter?
L305298 +++$+++ u6008 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I didn't want to kill her, Will.
L305297 +++$+++ u6009 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Don't you pull that shit with me.
L305296 +++$+++ u6008 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Then so was mine...
L305295 +++$+++ u6009 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I told you that was an accident!
L305294 +++$+++ u6008 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Kay told me.  She comes to me, you know. Tells me things.  About you.  About me.
L305293 +++$+++ u6009 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What the hell do you know?
L305290 +++$+++ u6008 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ But we work so well together...
L305289 +++$+++ u6009 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ There's nothing more to talk about.
L305288 +++$+++ u6008 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I thought maybe we could talk some more.
L305287 +++$+++ u6009 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Congratulations.
L305286 +++$+++ u6008 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Told you I could write an ending.
L305285 +++$+++ u6009 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Randy Stetz is in jail.
L305217 +++$+++ u6008 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ He.  Well, he...
L305216 +++$+++ u6009 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What about him?
L305209 +++$+++ u6008 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
L305208 +++$+++ u6009 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
L305207 +++$+++ u6008 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Yes.
L305206 +++$+++ u6009 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
L305205 +++$+++ u6008 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Yes.
L305204 +++$+++ u6009 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You gave her gifts.
L305203 +++$+++ u6008 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I was a mentor to her.
L305202 +++$+++ u6009 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ But you wanted to.
L305201 +++$+++ u6008 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ No.
L305200 +++$+++ u6009 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Did you have sex with her?
L305199 +++$+++ u6008 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I suppose.
L305198 +++$+++ u6009 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ But she was an attractive girl.
L305197 +++$+++ u6008 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ She was only seventeen.
L305134 +++$+++ u6009 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yes down at the station.
L305133 +++$+++ u6008 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Down at the station?
L305132 +++$+++ u6009 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You're going to be brought in for questioning.
L305131 +++$+++ u6008 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Thought you might find that.
L305130 +++$+++ u6009 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
L305129 +++$+++ u6008 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Oh?
L305128 +++$+++ u6009 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I said you're going to get a phone call.
L305127 +++$+++ u6008 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I'm sorry?
L305122 +++$+++ u6009 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ The phone call.  The knapsack.
L305121 +++$+++ u6008 +++$+++ m398 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ No game.
L306113 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ We are a pair, and that's what counts.
L306112 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
L306111 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Your melancholy eyes...
L306110 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ You made me see their failings, Louis. You made me look at them with your eyes.
L306109 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You were their leader. They trusted you.
L306108 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.
L306107 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ And yet you knew what I would o.
L306106 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ No.
L306105 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You didn't even warm them, did you?
L306103 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I understand you only too well. You let them do it, as I let Lestat turn a child into a demon. As I let her rip Lestat's heart to pieces! Well I am no longer that passive fool that has spun evil from evil till the web traps the one who made it. Your melancholy spirit of this century! I know what I must do. And i warn you - you saved me tonight, so I return the favour - do not go near your cell in the Theatre Des Vampires again.
L306102 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Louis, I swear I did not.
L306101 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen.
L306100 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You let them do it.
L306099 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.
L306098 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
L306097 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ I couldn't prevent it.
L306094 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Louis, I can't save her. I will only risk losing you -
L306093 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
L306092 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ I can't save her.
L306091 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Not without Claudia. Where is she?
L306090 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Follow me - that way - through my cell -
L306089 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Where is she? Where's Claudia?
L306032 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Yes I knew him. Knew him well enough not to mourn his passing.
L306031 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Lestat! You knew Lestat!
L306030 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
L306029 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yes... My God...
L306028 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Are these not the answers you came for?
L306027 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Like moths around the candle of the age. Decadent, useless. They can't reflect anything. But you do. You reflect its broken heart.
L306026 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ And the vampires of the Theatre?
L306022 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ How he must have loved you.
L306021 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ That's what the one who made me said.
L306020 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ You would never give up life. If the world were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and study it. You see too clearly. You see too much.
L306019 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ We can do that?
L306018 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
L306017 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You said there were none.
L306016 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ So soon? Without any of those answers you so longed for?
L306015 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Then I leave too.
L306014 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
L306013 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ We want no quarrel with him.
L306012 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
L306011 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Then blame the one who made her...
L306010 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
L306009 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ But why?
L306008 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ She is.
L306007 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
L306006 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ If you say so. You are innocent.
L306005 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ No, my beloved, my child.
L306004 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Your lover.
L306003 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Claudia is dear to me. My... daughter.
L306002 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Listen to me.
L306001 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ I was waiting for you...
L305970 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Knew? You mean he is...
L305969 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
L305968 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ The one who made you should have told you this. The one who left the old world for the new...
L305967 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
L305966 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
L305965 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ None that I've ever known. I know nothing of God or the Devil, I have never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that would damn or save my soul. And as far as I know, after four hundred years I am the oldest living vampire in the world.
L305964 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?
L305963 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ I have not spoken to him...
L305962 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Then God does not exist...
L305961 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ And perhaps this is the only real evil left...
L305960 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Perhaps...
L305959 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Then there is nothing.
L305958 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ I understand. I saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl. I saw you with the boy. You die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. But does that make you evil? Or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good?
L305957 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ No.
L305956 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You mean we are not children of Satan?
L305955 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ That is a picture, nothing more.
L305954 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ But the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil...
L305953 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Surely you know the one who made you...
L305952 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Who made us what we are?
L305951 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Nothing if not vampires...
L305950 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What are we?
L305949 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Ah! You have questions?
L305948 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ So you have the answers...
L305947 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ If there were a leader, I would be the one.
L305946 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Are you the leader of tis group?
L305945 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ You don't want to answer... Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away.
L305944 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ But how did you come into existence?
L305943 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ We had feared we were the only ones...
L305942 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Disappointing, isn't it? To come so far and find so little. Jaded ingenues, amusing themselves with make- believe...
L305940 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed.
L305939 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Your lips, they didn't move.
L305938 +++$+++ u6010 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ ARMAND +++$+++ Yes, and very beautiful.
L305937 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Monstrous.
L305804 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I'll put you in your coffin. Forever.
L305803 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Louis, put me in my coffin...
L305802 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Don't Louis --
L305800 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.
L305799 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Laudanum!
L305798 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ No. Laudanum.
L305797 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?
L305796 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ We forgive each other then?
L305795 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
L305794 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
L305791 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Then I hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess.
L305790 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
L305789 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Stop pestering me then!
L305788 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I came to make peace with you, even if you're the father of lies. I want things to be as they were.
L305787 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ What plans?
L305786 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
L305785 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Not you my dear.
L305784 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
L305783 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
L305782 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Is that supposed to frighten me?
L305781 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
L305780 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Does it?
L305779 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ What is it now? You irritate me! Your very presence irritates me!
L305734 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't.
L305733 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!!
L305731 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ DID YOU DO IT TO ME????
L305730 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Stop her Louis!
L305729 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ You made us what we are, didn't you?
L305727 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ But it wasn't always so! I had a mother once! And Louis - he had a wife! He was mortal the same as she! And so was I!
L305726 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ It will grow back again!
L305725 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ And if I cut my hair again?
L305724 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ What you are? You would be something other than you are?
L305723 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am?
L305718 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why?
L305717 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ But you're the fairest by far.
L305716 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I have. Or there would be twice as many.
L305715 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.
L305714 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Is this my birthday?
L305713 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ I didn't realise.
L305712 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
L305711 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ What night? What do you mean?
L305710 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Why always on this night?
L305665 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and Louis' daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now he's not. He's going to stay and make you happy.
L305664 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I'm not your daughter.
L305658 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child.
L305657 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I want some more.
L305652 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Yes, cherie, of course you want more. And I'll show you how to get it. You drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? Never again.
L305651 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ More.
L306066 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What died tonight inside that room was not that woman. It will take her many nights to die, perhaps yeaars. What has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human.
L306065 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ What do you mean?
L306064 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Bear me no ill will, my love. We are now even.
L306063 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ It's only mortal death.
L306062 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ But if she dies...
L306061 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember.
L306049 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ And who will care for me my love, my dark angel, when you are gone?
L306048 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yes...
L306047 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Oh God! I love you still, that's the torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis...
L306045 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Yet you could do it to me! Snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale! Couldn't you have waited? Six more years and I would have had that shape! And now you weep! You haven't tears enough for what you've done to me.
L306044 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!
L306043 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
L306042 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ How do we seem to you? Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you ask me! Have you any idea of the thing you will become?

L305995 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
L305994 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ That's not so.
L305993 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.

L305991 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.
L305990 +++$+++ u6011 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Love?
L305989 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
