L304331 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ Lowell!
L304330 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
L304329 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ Lowell.
L304328 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ "Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
L304327 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ Lowell.
L304314 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ What?
L304313 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ I discovered this. SEC filing...  For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.
L304271 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ After we corroborate it. That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show.  Anything else?
L304270 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. This is a news organization. People are always telling us things they shouldn't. We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest... And if it is, we air it.
L304256 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ Good.
L304255 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
L304147 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Ordinary people! Under extraordinary pressure, Mike. What the hell do you expect? Grace and consistency?
L304146 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ Who are these people?
L304145 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Oh, man.
L304139 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ Yeah, well, questions will go toward what work you did there, why you were fired. And others will deal...
L304138 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
L304137 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ Thank you for saying that...
L304135 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ How are the rooms? Comfortable?
L304134 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ So, is everything okay?
L303944 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ Oh, torture? Great ratings.
L303943 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained.  What if he were "compelled"?
L303942 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L303941 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...
L303928 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ What's this?
L303927 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ No shit.
L303926 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Hardly new news.
L303925 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
L303924 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... Referred to this... Said they should be afraid of him... I assume, afraid of what he could reveal.  Now, you tell me. What does this guy have to say that threatens these people?
L303923 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ What "Seven Dwarfs?"
L303922 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
L303834 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ Bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door...
L303833 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Yeah.
L303832 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ You eating with us?
L303831 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ ...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
L303748 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Don't interpret that!  Hold it. Hold it. Hold it! Slow, slow!!  Sheikh, do you mind... if you would just turn your chair a little bit to face Mr. Wallace?
L303747 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
L303746 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ We're there.
L303675 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ That's good. That works.  Uh, you know, I want to ask you something... I know it sounds odd... but...
L303674 +++$+++ u1507 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ THE SHEIKH +++$+++ Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow.
L303672 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ No. We don't do that.  You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike Wallace. So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity. You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected, TV-magazine news show in America.
L303671 +++$+++ u1507 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ THE SHEIKH +++$+++ Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first. Then I decide if I grant the interview.
L303670 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.  That's why.
L303669 +++$+++ u1507 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ THE SHEIKH +++$+++ Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?
L303668 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ What I've seen... I've liked.
L303667 +++$+++ u1507 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ THE SHEIKH +++$+++ How have you liked your stay?
L303666 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Yeah... Thank you.
L303665 +++$+++ u1507 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ THE SHEIKH +++$+++ Coffee?
L304537 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Yeah. Yeah, I will.
L304536 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ You try and have a good time.
L304535 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
L304534 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Where are you, anyway?
L304531 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'?  You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them.
L304530 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
L304529 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
L304528 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ "Up to you, Jeffrey. That's the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to know." Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around.
L304527 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
L304526 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ You greased the rails!
L304525 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ That's bullshit, Jeff!
L304524 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ You manipulated me into this...!
L304410 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs.  I am trying to protect you, man!
L304409 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class.
L304408 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ I told the truth... I told the truth.
L304407 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
L304406 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ What does this have to do with my testimony?! I told the truth! It's valid and true and provable!
L304405 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ That's not the point.
L304404 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ What does this have to do with my testimony?
L304403 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ That's the whole point, Jeffrey. That's the whole point. Anyone's. Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. Don't you understand?
L304402 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ A can opener! A $39.95 can opener. I canceled payment... It was junk.  You ever bounce a check, Lowell? You ever look at another woman's tits? You ever cheat a little on your taxes?  Whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn't have any flaws...?
L304401 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ ABC Telemarketing Company.
L304400 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ ABC...?
L304399 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
L304398 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ What kind of shit is this? I was not on the team, I sparred with the Olympic Team... okay?
L304397 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?
L304396 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ What?
L304395 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
L304394 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ She did not sue me. We had a dispute over money... I settled it, she dropped the complaint...  Any other questions?
L304393 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ She sued you for back payments of child support?
L304392 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ ...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn't handle it the right way...
L304391 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.
L304390 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ I told the truth!
L304386 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ What do you want to do, Lowell, look up my ass, too...!
L304385 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Oh, you know what we do or do not need to know? Since when have you become a media expert?
L304355 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ I do not think that you "know" for me... what it is to walk in my shoes...  ...for my kids to have seen it... for them to know why I've put them through what I did... the public airing of that... the testament to why I did what I did... you're telling me is not going to see the light of day.
L304354 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ No? No, what?
L304353 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ No.
L304352 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how...
L304351 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ What?!
L304350 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say it. They do not want to air it.
L304253 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive." Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe they perjured..." Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on the B-side...
L304252 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ "Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..."
L304228 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ No. I mean since whenever...
L304227 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ You mean... since this morning?
L304226 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ What's changed?
L304222 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ I don't know what to do.
L304221 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ I heard about the Kentucky gag order...
L304220 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Yeah, great.
L304219 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ You attract a crowd.
L304189 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Did you have a good day?
L304188 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
L304187 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
L304186 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ I heard.
L304185 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
L304182 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ ...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.
L304181 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Lowell, I can't afford --
L304144 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ ...to talk about it. To think about it. I had a plan to ease her into it. But, I really -- I didn't know how to do that...
L304143 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Liane, this is a preliminary...  You didn't tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York for?
L304100 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ I'll call them, Lowell.
L304099 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Good. But Jeff...
L304096 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ They get to go home at night. What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?! My girls are crying, so fuck them! I want to tape! I'm done thinking about it.
L304095 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Jeff...
L304094 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ They do this with impunity!
L304093 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Jeff, call the FBI right away...
L304090 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
L304089 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Excuse me. Yeah...
L304036 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Words! While you've been dickin' around at fucking company golf tournaments, I been out in the world, giving my word and backing it up with action.
L304035 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
L304034 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!
L304033 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ I don't think you really understand --
L304032 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
L304031 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
L304030 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Yes.
L304029 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
L304028 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
L304027 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ You believe that?
L304026 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
L304025 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ No.
L304024 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ You believe that?
L304022 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ ...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
L304021 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
L304020 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
L304019 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
L304018 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
L304017 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Why?
L304016 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.
L304015 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
L304014 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ You charge by the hour?
L304013 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
L304012 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
L304011 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Next to your father?
L304010 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
L304009 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
L304008 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Tempura...
L304007 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ What did you get us?
L304004 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ It's okay.
L304003 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
L304002 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Hello. You there
L304001 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ It's obvious, isn't it?
L304000 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ How'd you know that, Lowell?
L303999 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Makes you feel good? Putting what you know to use?
L303998 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ ...okay.
L303997 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
L303996 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow. So, what about?
L303985 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Good.  You have kids?
L303984 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway.  How are your kids handling the new house?
L303982 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ You okay?
L303981 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ The new place? New.
L303919 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
L303918 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
L303916 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
L303915 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
L303914 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
L303913 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ ...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
L303912 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
L303911 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Seven dwarfs?
L303908 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ I don't know... you think the Knicks are gonna make it through the semi- finals?
L303907 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
L303906 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
L303905 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Like what?
L303904 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement?
L303903 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ They should be.
L303902 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ They're afraid of you, aren't they?
L303901 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.
L303897 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ No. I did not. Big Tobacco is a big story. And you got something important to say. I can tell.  But, yes. I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story, I don't burn people.
L303896 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ You came all the way down here to tell me that?
L303895 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
L303894 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
L303893 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
L303892 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
L303891 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Why am I gonna mention your name?
L303890 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
L303889 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
L303888 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have?
L303887 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
L303886 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ What do...
L303885 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Good. I want to talk to you.
L303884 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ C'mere. I want to talk to you.
L303883 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ I'm Lowell Bergman. We spoke on the phone, remember?
L303882 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Jump in, quick, c'mon...
L303881 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?
L303877 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Fuck you, too!
L303876 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ What are you talking about? Where are you?
L303875 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ ...protect your sources...! You screwed me! You sold me out!
L303827 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ If you want to do it.
L303826 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Should I just take the documents now?
L303825 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
L303824 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ How much would I get paid?
L303823 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Did work.
L303822 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Did work.
L303821 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously.  Where do you work?
L303820 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?
