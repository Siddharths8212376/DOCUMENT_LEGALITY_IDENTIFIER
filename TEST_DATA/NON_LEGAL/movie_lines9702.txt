L138319 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
L138318 +++$+++ u4564 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ DR. TAYLOR +++$+++ No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
L138317 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
L138316 +++$+++ u4564 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ DR. TAYLOR +++$+++ Just part of hospital routine.
L138315 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
L138314 +++$+++ u4564 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ DR. TAYLOR +++$+++ I'm your Psychiatrist.
L138313 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I haven't seen you before.
L138312 +++$+++ u4564 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ DR. TAYLOR +++$+++ Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
L138311 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Fine. Fine.
L138310 +++$+++ u4564 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ DR. TAYLOR +++$+++ How are you feeling today?
L138087 +++$+++ u4563 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ DR. BRODSKY +++$+++ No, no, boy. You really must leave it to us, but be cheerful about it. In less than a fortnight now, you'll be a free man.
L138086 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
L138085 +++$+++ u4563 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ DR. BRODSKY +++$+++ You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
L138084 +++$+++ u4563 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ DR. BRODSKY +++$+++ You're not cured yet, my boy.
L138083 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You needn't take it any further, sir. You've proved to me that all this ultra-violence and killing is wrong and terribly wrong. I've learned my lesson, sir. I see now what I've never seen before I'm cured, praise Bog!
L138080 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes!!!
L138079 +++$+++ u4563 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ DR. BRODSKY +++$+++ You're keen on music?
L138074 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ That!... Using Ludwig van like that! He did no harm to anyone. Beethoven just wrote music.
L138073 +++$+++ u4563 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ DR. BRODSKY +++$+++ What's all this about sin?
L138062 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Let me be sick... I want to get up. Get me something to be sick in... Stop the film... Please stop it... I can't stand it any more. Stop it please... please.
L138061 +++$+++ u4563 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ DR. BRODSKY +++$+++ Very soon now the drug will cause the subject to experience a death- like paralysis together with deep feelings of terror and helplessness. One of our earlier test subjects described it as being like death, a sense of stifling and drowning, and it is during this period we have found the subject will make his most rewarding associations between his catastrophic experience and environment and the violence he sees. Alex retching violently and struggling against his strait jacket.
L138176 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Then there was like a sea of dirty, smelly old men trying to get at your humble Narrator, with their feeble rookers and horny old claws. It was Old Age having a go at Youth and I daren't do a single solitary thing, O my brothers, it being better to be hit at like that, than want to be sick and feel that horrible pain. The Tramp crowd round Alex, shouting.
L138175 +++$+++ u4574 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ TRAMP +++$+++ They laughed at me blood and me moans. This murderous young pig is a prize specimen of the cowardly brutal young. He is in our midst and at our mercy. Give it to him. That's it. Old Tramps begin to beat at Alex.
L138174 +++$+++ u4574 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ TRAMP +++$+++ Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.
L138173 +++$+++ u4574 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ TRAMP +++$+++ This is the poisonous young swine that near done me in. Him and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me. Alex breaks away again.
L138172 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Leave me alone, brother. I've never seen you before. Tramp shouts to other Meths drinkers and Tramps.
L138171 +++$+++ u4574 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ TRAMP +++$+++ I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God!
L138170 +++$+++ u4574 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ TRAMP +++$+++ Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
L138169 +++$+++ u4574 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ TRAMP +++$+++ Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.
L138168 +++$+++ u4574 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ TRAMP +++$+++ Can you spare me some cutter, me brother? Can you spare some cutter, me brother? Alex, without looking at him, reaches in his pocket and gives him some money.
L137680 +++$+++ u4574 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ TRAMP +++$+++ It's a stinking world because there's no law and order any more. It's a stinking world because it lets the young get onto the old like you done. It's no world for an old man any more. What sort of a world is it at all? Men on the moon and men spinning around the earth and there's not no attention paid to earthly law and order no more. The Tramp starts singing again.
L137679 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
L137678 +++$+++ u4574 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ TRAMP +++$+++ Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
L137677 +++$+++ u4574 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ TRAMP +++$+++ Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh.
L137676 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ One thing I could never stand is to see a filthy, dirty old drunkie, howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers and going blerp, blerp in between as it might be a filthy old orchestra in his stinking rotten guts. I could never stand to see anyone like that, whatever his age might be, but more especially when he was real old like this one was. The boys stop and applaud him.
L137979 +++$+++ u4572 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ Amen. They cross themselves.
L137978 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
L137977 +++$+++ u4572 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.
L137976 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.
L137975 +++$+++ u4572 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
L137974 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
L137973 +++$+++ u4572 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
L137972 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
L137971 +++$+++ u4572 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
L137970 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
L137969 +++$+++ u4572 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ I take it you are referring to the Ludovico Technique?
L137968 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?
L137967 +++$+++ u4572 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
L137966 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
L137965 +++$+++ u4572 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
L137964 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Father - may I ask you a question in private?
L137963 +++$+++ u4572 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
L137962 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
L137961 +++$+++ u4572 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ Indeed.
L137960 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I've done my best, have I not?
L137959 +++$+++ u4572 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ You have, my son.
L137958 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Father, I have tried, have I not?
L137957 +++$+++ u4572 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
L137956 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ If thou lose hope being weary in the days of distress, thy strength shall be diminished.
L137923 +++$+++ u4558 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ CHIEF GUARD +++$+++ Now then. Face the wall. Bend over and touch your toes. Chief Guard inspects Alex's anus with a penlight.
L137922 +++$+++ u4557 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ CHECK-IN +++$+++ Mothballs, sir.
L137919 +++$+++ u4558 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ CHIEF GUARD +++$+++ Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?
L137918 +++$+++ u4557 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ CHECK-IN +++$+++ One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
L137913 +++$+++ u4558 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ CHIEF GUARD +++$+++ Have you ever had any attacks of fainting or dizziness?
L137912 +++$+++ u4557 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ CHECK-IN +++$+++ One pair of trousers - blue pinstriped.
L137905 +++$+++ u4558 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ CHIEF GUARD +++$+++ Have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness?
L137904 +++$+++ u4557 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ CHECK-IN +++$+++ One shirt - blue, collar attached.
L137891 +++$+++ u4558 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ CHIEF GUARD +++$+++ Prison custody?
L137890 +++$+++ u4557 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ CHECK-IN +++$+++ One jacket - blue pinstripe.
L138025 +++$+++ u4567 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ GOVERNOR +++$+++ It says that you are willing to have the residue of your sentence commuted to the Ludovico treatment. Alex signs. Governor gathers up papers. Alex dots the last "i" and smiles.
L138024 +++$+++ u4558 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ CHIEF GUARD +++$+++ Don't read it - sign it!
L138021 +++$+++ u4558 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ CHIEF GUARD +++$+++ Answer when the Governor asks you a question you filthy young swine!
L138020 +++$+++ u4567 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ GOVERNOR +++$+++ You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
L138019 +++$+++ u4558 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ CHIEF GUARD +++$+++ Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!
L138015 +++$+++ u4558 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ CHIEF GUARD +++$+++ Forward to the white line, toes behind it. Full name and number to the Governor. Chief Guard closes door.
L138014 +++$+++ u4567 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ GOVERNOR +++$+++ Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
L138013 +++$+++ u4558 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ CHIEF GUARD +++$+++ Sir, 655321, sir.
L137988 +++$+++ u4558 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ CHIEF GUARD +++$+++ Sir.
L137987 +++$+++ u4567 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ GOVERNOR +++$+++ Carry on, Chief.
L137986 +++$+++ u4558 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ CHIEF GUARD +++$+++ Leave to carry on, sir, please?
L137985 +++$+++ u4567 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ GOVERNOR +++$+++ Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.
L138193 +++$+++ u4560 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ DIM +++$+++ This is to make sure you stay cured. Georgie hits Alex in the stomach with his blackjack. Then, they push his head under the water and methodically start to beat him with their blackjacks. After a full minute of this, they drag him out, halt-drowned,
L138192 +++$+++ u4566 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Enough is remembered though, little Alex. Dim and Georgie laugh. They drag Alex to a low water through.
L137794 +++$+++ u4566 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Something to sharpen us up, you especially. We have the start.
L137793 +++$+++ u4560 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ DIM +++$+++ Moloko-plus.
L137788 +++$+++ u4560 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ DIM +++$+++ Big, big money.
L137787 +++$+++ u4566 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
L137786 +++$+++ u4560 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ DIM +++$+++ Yeah... Pete the English.
L137785 +++$+++ u4566 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
L137784 +++$+++ u4560 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ DIM +++$+++ Pitiful rookerful...
L138305 +++$+++ u4571 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PEE +++$+++ Are you feeling better?
L138304 +++$+++ u4565 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ EM +++$+++ Hullo, son, how are you?
L138155 +++$+++ u4565 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ EM +++$+++ Would you like me to make you a nice cup of tea, son?
L138154 +++$+++ u4571 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PEE +++$+++ D'you think we should do something?
L138151 +++$+++ u4565 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ EM +++$+++ Dad... It's the treatment. More retching.
L138150 +++$+++ u4571 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PEE +++$+++ Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright?
L138139 +++$+++ u4571 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PEE +++$+++ Aye. You should have let us know, lad, not that we're not very pleased to see you again. All cured too, eh?
L138138 +++$+++ u4565 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ EM +++$+++ We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
L138137 +++$+++ u4571 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PEE +++$+++ Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.
L137744 +++$+++ u4565 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ EM +++$+++ Well, like he says, it's mostly odd things he does, helping like... here and there, as it might be.
L137743 +++$+++ u4571 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PEE +++$+++ I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
L137742 +++$+++ u4565 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ EM +++$+++ No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
L137741 +++$+++ u4571 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PEE +++$+++ Yes, I heard. D'you know what time he got in last night?
L138010 +++$+++ u4569 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ MINISTER +++$+++ Thank you.
L138009 +++$+++ u4567 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ GOVERNOR +++$+++ Shall we go to my office?
L138006 +++$+++ u4569 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ MINISTER +++$+++ No, no, no. That's enough. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.
L138005 +++$+++ u4567 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ GOVERNOR +++$+++ Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.
L137996 +++$+++ u4569 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ MINISTER +++$+++ Not a chance, my dear fellow. The Ggovernment can't be concerned any longer with outmoded penological theories. Soon we may be needing all of out prison space for political offenders. Common criminals like these are best dealt with on a purely curative basis. Kill the criminal reflex that's all. Full implementation in a year's time. Punishment means nothing to them, you can see that... they enjoy their so-called punishment. Alex seizes his chance as they pass by.
L137995 +++$+++ u4567 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ GOVERNOR +++$+++ I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
L137994 +++$+++ u4569 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ MINISTER +++$+++ Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
L137993 +++$+++ u4567 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ GOVERNOR +++$+++ Four in this block, sir.
L137992 +++$+++ u4569 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ MINISTER +++$+++ How many to a cell?
L140724 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yes!  Stay put, goddamn it!  Don't move from that spot...
L140723 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?
L140722 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!
L140721 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Seventh, files section.  What should I do?
L140720 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Where are you, what floor?
L140719 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ In my office?
L140718 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ ...he's two floors below you.
L140717 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ No, no, <u>wait</u>...
L140716 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ ...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building...
L140715 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ It doesn't matter!  Just get out of the goddamn building...
L140714 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Did you say <u>Dmitri?</u> How do you know about my case?  I don't understand...
L140713 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Dmitri hired him!  He's already killed all your witnesses, now he's coming after you!  He was stalking you when I dropped you off.  I don't know what happened, but he diverted and got into my cab, instead.
L140712 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ If this is a joke, it's not funny.
L140711 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ <u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
L140710 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
L140709 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
L140708 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
L140707 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Max, the cab driver!
L140706 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Max...
L140705 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Annie...it's Max.
L140026 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Sure thing.
L140025 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Thanks for everything, Max.  Wow...
L140024 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yes, you could.  I think you need it more than I do.  It'll help.  I promise.
L140023 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No, no way, I couldn't take that...
L140021 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Dozen times a day.
L140020 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ How often you go?
L140019 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Soon.  But I take little ones all the time.  Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.
L140018 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ When was the last time you took one?
L140017 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Not in a cab...  I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...
L140016 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Just had one.
L140015 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You need a vacation.
L140014 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
L140013 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ But not now?
L140012 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Most of the time.
L140011 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You never answered my question.  You like what you do?
L140009 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L140008 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Big case?
L140007 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Not quite.  He did defense.  I'm a prosecutor...
L140006 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ ...Bottega.  Guy gets in my cab wearing a catcher's mask, I think he's a ballplayer.  You?  Definitely Clarence Darrow.
L140005 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Bottega.
L140004 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Sure.  I'm starting an 800 hotline.  Caught part of your phone call.  And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega...
L140003 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You psychic?
L140002 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You like being a lawyer?
L140001 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Travel...and things.
L140000 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Like what?
L139999 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ This?  Temporary.  To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
L139998 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You're an anomaly in today's world, Max.  You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...?
L139997 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ There were two of us.  I had the other guy killed.  Don't need the competition...
L139996 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No?  How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
L139995 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ It's no big deal.
L139994 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
L139993 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
L139992 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
L139991 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
L139990 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
L139989 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Let me guess.  Clarinet?
L139988 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I used to play this piece back in high school.
L139987 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You like Bach?
L139985 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No.  You were right, I was wrong...  ...Max.
L139984 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ No.  I got lucky with the lights.
L139983 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Go ahead, say it.
L139982 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You got a deal.
L139981 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ The ride is free.
L139980 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?
L139979 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ But Bowery's fine, if that's what you want.
L139978 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ First Friday of the month?  Linens. Roll right off the trucks.  They're in and out in twenty minutes...  ...which means they left fifteen minutes ago.  Traffic will be smooth.
L139977 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
L139976 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
L139975 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
L139974 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Sixth is faster.
L139973 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What?
L139972 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
L139971 +++$+++ u4575 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Park Avenue and East 2nd. Take Centre to Canal, up the Bowery, Cooper and Third, left on 41st, come around on Park.
L139970 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Hi ya' doin'?  Where to?
L140690 +++$+++ u4576 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ You sure?  You look pretty shaky...
L140689 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm...fine.  Fine.
L140688 +++$+++ u4576 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ You dizzy?  You want to sit down?
L140197 +++$+++ u4576 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ Save me the grief.  Step out of the car, sir, and open the trunk.
L140196 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Come on, it's been a long, shitty day. How about a break?  I'll call a tow truck myself, I swear.  I won't budge from this spot.
L140192 +++$+++ u4576 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ This vehicle's not safe to drive. We're gonna have to impound it.  Get you towed.  Step away from the vehicle and pop the trunk.  I'm sorry, sir, you'll have to find another cab.
L140191 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
L140190 +++$+++ u4576 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ You still carrying passengers?
L140189 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?
L140188 +++$+++ u4576 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ A deer?
L140184 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yes.
L140183 +++$+++ u4576 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ This your current address?
L140359 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Then let's have it.
L140358 +++$+++ u4577 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I know the answer.  I know all there is to know about Louis.
