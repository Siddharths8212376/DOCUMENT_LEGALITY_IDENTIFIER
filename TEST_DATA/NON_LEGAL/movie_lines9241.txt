L360972 +++$+++ u1939 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's just what you need.
L360971 +++$+++ u1942 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I know.
L360970 +++$+++ u1939 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ He's alright.
L360969 +++$+++ u1942 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ He's great, right. Is he great?
L360968 +++$+++ u1939 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ I don't know. Do whatever you want.
L360967 +++$+++ u1942 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Should I fuck him?
L360966 +++$+++ u1939 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ He's okay.
L360965 +++$+++ u1942 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Is he cute?
L360960 +++$+++ u1942 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I'm having fun, Sean. Can you handle that...? Yeah. He doesn't judge me.
L360959 +++$+++ u1939 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Holy shit.
L360958 +++$+++ u1942 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Will you leave me alone, already...? No, Sean, it's over... I don't care... As a matter of fact, I am... Yeah. In his hotel room...
L360328 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What? You don't think Horrace would leave your white ass in there to hang?
L360327 +++$+++ u1956 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Bullshit.
L360326 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
L360325 +++$+++ u1956 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
L360324 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Nobody's fuckin talking to you.
L360321 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No more.
L360320 +++$+++ u1956 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
L360319 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Bullshit.
L360318 +++$+++ u1956 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit.
L360317 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
L360316 +++$+++ u1956 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ What the fuck was that about?
L361195 +++$+++ u1941 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ CHLOE +++$+++ I love you. Come home.
L361194 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.
L361193 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah. Are you sure mommy's not home? It's very late.
L361192 +++$+++ u1941 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ CHLOE +++$+++ Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
L361191 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What time is it there?
L361190 +++$+++ u1941 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ CHLOE +++$+++ No.
L361189 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Mommy's not home?
L361188 +++$+++ u1941 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ CHLOE +++$+++ I don't know.
L361187 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
L361186 +++$+++ u1941 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ CHLOE +++$+++ Uncle Bobby?
L361185 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Chloe?
L361184 +++$+++ u1941 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ CHLOE +++$+++ Hello.
L360515 +++$+++ u1941 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ CHLOE +++$+++ I want spaghettis.
L360514 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
L360513 +++$+++ u1941 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ CHLOE +++$+++ You're not my daddy.
L360496 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
L360495 +++$+++ u1941 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ CHLOE +++$+++ It's a poison arrow tree frog.
L360491 +++$+++ u1941 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ CHLOE +++$+++ He's not doing it.
L360490 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What's wrong, baby?
L360476 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Show uncle Ricky what you made.
L360475 +++$+++ u1941 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ CHLOE +++$+++ No.
L360474 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?
L360473 +++$+++ u1941 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ CHLOE +++$+++ It's daytime.
L360472 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ She's, uh, sleeping.
L360471 +++$+++ u1941 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ CHLOE +++$+++ A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
L360466 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?
L360465 +++$+++ u1941 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ CHLOE +++$+++ Ricky's not wearing one.
L361271 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ I want you to take her with you.
L361270 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What'd you say?
L361269 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ Take her.
L361268 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.
L361267 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
L361266 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
L361265 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ Goodbye, Bobby.
L361264 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ How could you let her see this?
L361263 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ I never promised you anything.
L360543 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ Don't get my hopes up. If I quit, what then? I can't go through this again.
L360542 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ She needs a family. A dad. I'll give her what you never had.
L360541 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is.
L360540 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Max offered to stake me.
L360539 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ With what?
L360538 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'll support you.
L360537 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
L360536 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I want you to quit.
L360535 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
L360534 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!
L360533 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ Shhh. He'll hear you.
L360532 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
L360531 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ Ho's a good guy --
L360530 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
L360529 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
L360528 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No way that cocksucker's driving you.
L360512 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Go.
L360511 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ Yeah? You sure?
L360510 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Go finish getting ready. I'll take care of dinner.
L360283 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
L360282 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No coke tonight.  Right?
L360281 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
L360280 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
L360279 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ You shouldn't. He likes you.
L360278 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I feel weird asking him.
L360277 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
L360276 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Well, that's not gonna happen.
L360275 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
L360274 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
L360273 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
L360272 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You talk to Max today?
L360267 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
L360266 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
L360265 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'm ready.
L360264 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
L360263 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Who's watching the baby?
L360262 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
L360261 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
L360260 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ Oh, please.
L360259 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
L360258 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
L360257 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
L360256 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
L360255 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
L360254 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ Oh my god. What happened?
L360253 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.
L360252 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No. What kind of bachelor party?
L360251 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
L360250 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ So, what kind of gig is this?
L360249 +++$+++ u1948 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JESS +++$+++ Where were you?
L360248 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Honey?
L361262 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I don't get it.
L361261 +++$+++ u1946 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORNY GUY +++$+++ I -- I -- I... Don't...
L360313 +++$+++ u1946 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORNY GUY +++$+++ Come on, dude. The other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. I know the drill, I'll wear a rubber --
L360312 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Your dance is over.
L360311 +++$+++ u1946 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORNY GUY +++$+++ Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
L360310 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Get your hands off of her.
L360309 +++$+++ u1946 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORNY GUY +++$+++ Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
L360308 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I said no touching.
L360306 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching.
L360305 +++$+++ u1946 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORNY GUY +++$+++ But what about them?
L360304 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ There's no touching.
L360303 +++$+++ u1946 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORNY GUY +++$+++ Whu --
L361212 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ I guess inside. Or he never made it. Either way, I don't give a shit. Let's get this over with.
L361211 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Where's Ricky.
L361210 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ This is it.
L361209 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ That's it.
L361208 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ That it?
L361207 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
L361206 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ How so?
L361205 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ Ricky's taken care of.
L361204 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Where's Ricky?
L361203 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ Quick drop. In and out.
L361202 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Where we going?
L361182 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
L361181 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
L361180 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
L361179 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Heard of them.
L361176 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ Nah, man. No one is. They got some Puerto Ricans and a new crop of fuckin Irish immigrants.
L361175 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Ruiz tied in out there?
L361174 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it.
L361173 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What do you mean 'troughed?'
L361172 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ He must have that shit troughed.
L361171 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah?
L361170 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ Brooklyn.
L361169 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No.
L361168 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?
L361067 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.
L361066 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Where is this happening?
L361065 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
L361064 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ So what do we do?
L361059 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah.
L361058 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
L361057 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What's that?
L361056 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
L361055 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Why isn't Ruiz coming?
L360917 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Shit.
L360916 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
L360915 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ When's it going down?
L360914 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
L360913 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ How bad is it?
L360880 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
L360879 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ So, when's the drop.
L360878 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
L360877 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What's his name?
L360876 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
L360875 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ He making the drop?
L360776 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah. Where is he?
L360775 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ What's up. You all ready to meet Ruiz?
L360546 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ Excuse --
L360545 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Get away from her.
L360544 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ C'mon girl. Eat up.
L360521 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ She'll be out in a minute.
L360520 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ Yeah.

L360518 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ What's up? Jess ready?
L360302 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ I'm serious. Humping sheetrock and driving on weekends got to get to you after a while. Might be nice to buy your lady something. All it takes is one fight.
L360301 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah, sure.
L360300 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
L360299 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ 5-5-1.
L360298 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ What's your record at?
L360297 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Draw.
