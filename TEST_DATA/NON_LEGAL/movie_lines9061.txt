L221439 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ You don't think I'm good enough?
L221438 +++$+++ u946 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ CLURMAN +++$+++ Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
L221437 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
L221436 +++$+++ u946 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ CLURMAN +++$+++ I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
L221435 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ What's up?
L221433 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Oh.
L221432 +++$+++ u946 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ CLURMAN +++$+++ He's not here.
L221431 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Where's Clifford?
L221430 +++$+++ u946 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ CLURMAN +++$+++ Frances.
L221429 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Hello, Harold.
L221365 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford.
L221364 +++$+++ u946 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ CLURMAN +++$+++ ...Not only an artist, but an instrument of change. We must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs. We will not stand idly by as Fascist bombs obliterate democracy. We contribute our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in Spain, it will spread across Europe, jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive.  The artist, to be vital, must be a soldier too.
L221345 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Who is she?
L221344 +++$+++ u946 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ CLURMAN +++$+++ Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
L221343 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
L221342 +++$+++ u946 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ CLURMAN +++$+++ The Group is more than a theatre company. It's the embodiment of an ideal. Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. You see --
L221588 +++$+++ u947 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ You're under arrest.
L221587 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ GET OUT!
L221586 +++$+++ u947 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ Get your clothes on, lady --
L221585 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here --
L221584 +++$+++ u947 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ Get your clothes on.
L221517 +++$+++ u947 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ I didn't make the law, lady. I just enforce it.
L221516 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
L221515 +++$+++ u947 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?
L221514 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ In my eyes, officer.
L221513 +++$+++ u947 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ Hey, where's the fire, sister?
L221338 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ You want his name?
L221337 +++$+++ u948 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
L221336 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ What night?
L221335 +++$+++ u948 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
L221334 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ No?
L221333 +++$+++ u948 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
L221332 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Dick...
L221331 +++$+++ u948 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
L221330 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Dick, I can't even breathe here...
L221329 +++$+++ u948 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
L221328 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Dick, we need some time apart --
L221327 +++$+++ u948 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
L221326 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Showdown.
L221325 +++$+++ u948 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Without me.
L221324 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ ...Yes.
L221323 +++$+++ u948 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
L221322 +++$+++ u948 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Yeah. She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand.
L221321 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Fired?
L221320 +++$+++ u948 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?
L221319 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Claire?
L221318 +++$+++ u948 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?
L221317 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Who?
L221316 +++$+++ u948 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ There've been some calls.
L221315 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Sort of.
L221314 +++$+++ u948 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ You learn your lines?
L221936 +++$+++ u949 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Good. 'Cause I don't want to see you again.
L221935 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ All square, Doc.
L221934 +++$+++ u949 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ We're all square now, Harry. Right?
L221932 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I gotta go now.
L221931 +++$+++ u949 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Harry!
L221928 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
L221927 +++$+++ u949 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
L221922 +++$+++ u949 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her.  Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.
L221921 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
L221920 +++$+++ u949 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
L221919 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
L222024 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Thank you, Harry.
L222023 +++$+++ u950 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ We'll get you home, Frances.
L222022 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.
L221908 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ One question. If I'm not myself now, just who do you think I am?
L221907 +++$+++ u950 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
L221906 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ ...I see.
L221905 +++$+++ u950 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
L221904 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
L221903 +++$+++ u950 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
L221902 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
L221901 +++$+++ u950 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
L221900 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ ...Don't you?
L221899 +++$+++ u950 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ I know you believe that.
L221898 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it.
L221081 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Thank you.
L221080 +++$+++ u951 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ DRAMA TEACHER +++$+++ New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
L221079 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Really?
L221078 +++$+++ u951 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ DRAMA TEACHER +++$+++ Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
L221077 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ But I'll never win that.
L221076 +++$+++ u951 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ DRAMA TEACHER +++$+++ This is the answer: a subscription drive to "Voice of Action!" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski!
L222051 +++$+++ u952 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ EDWARDS +++$+++ Thank you, Frances. And after the show we're hosting a reception for you and your friends at Hollywood's own Roosevelt Hotel!
L222050 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Thank you, Ralph.
L222047 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ No. Never.
L222046 +++$+++ u952 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ EDWARDS +++$+++ Were you a drug addict?
L222045 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ No.
L222044 +++$+++ u952 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ EDWARDS +++$+++ Were you an alcoholic?
L222043 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ ...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...
L222042 +++$+++ u952 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ EDWARDS +++$+++ ...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?
L222002 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
L222001 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ Are you... are you hungry?
L221999 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Daddy!
L221998 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ Please, Francie...
L221997 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?
L221996 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied.
L221995 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you.
L221994 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ They'll just catch you again, Francie. Besides, your mother will know.
L221993 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
L221992 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ Francie, you know I can't do that.
L221844 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ I love you too, Francie.
L221843 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I don't care, Dad. I love you.
L221842 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and... 
L221841 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ Always. Always.
L221840 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
L221839 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
L221838 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
L221837 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
L221836 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I know that, Dad, but --
L221835 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
L221834 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ ...So what do you think?
L221145 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ Be careful, Francie.
L221144 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.
L221130 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ ...Then go.
L221129 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
L221128 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ And you think it's worth all this?
L221127 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Of course.
L221126 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ You really want to go?
L221125 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ What do I do, Dad?
L221068 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away.
L221067 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --
L221047 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ And I can't understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more I tried to explain -- 
L221046 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ I know.
L221045 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ It's already started, Dad... with me.
L221043 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ He's a socialist, then?
L221042 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
L221041 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Is Kaminski a Communist?
L221040 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
L221039 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
L221038 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
L221037 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
L221036 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ You wrote it, didn't you?
L221035 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I didn't have much to do with it.
L221034 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
L221033 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Thanks, Dad.
L221032 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances.
L220966 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ See you next weekend, Dad.
L220965 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ Bye, baby.
L221064 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought.
L221063 +++$+++ u962 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
L221062 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
L221061 +++$+++ u962 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
L221060 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ See you next weekend?
L221059 +++$+++ u962 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ Good.
L221058 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ I'm going back to the hotel.
L221057 +++$+++ u962 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ That's right. I can't understand a man who puts strangers over his family, a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure.
L221056 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
L221055 +++$+++ u962 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
L221054 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
L221053 +++$+++ u962 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
L221052 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
L221051 +++$+++ u962 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ You're poisoning that child's mind.
L221029 +++$+++ u962 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer?
L221028 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ Thank you.
L221027 +++$+++ u962 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ Bread?
L221026 +++$+++ u962 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
L221025 +++$+++ u953 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ ERNEST +++$+++ It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
L221178 +++$+++ u954 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FIRE CHIEF +++$+++ Oh Angela, my own... Angela!
L221177 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Oh, Kurt!
L221176 +++$+++ u954 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FIRE CHIEF +++$+++ No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
L221175 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ But, Kurt, I...
L221174 +++$+++ u954 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FIRE CHIEF +++$+++ Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
L221173 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Kurt!
L221595 +++$+++ u966 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ Occupation?
L221594 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
L221593 +++$+++ u966 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ Address?
L221592 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Fifteen.
L221591 +++$+++ u966 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ Age?
L221590 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am!
L221589 +++$+++ u966 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ Name?
L221418 +++$+++ u969 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.
L221417 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Just one minute...
L221415 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Why, you... you little bastard!
L221414 +++$+++ u969 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
L221413 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ What is this?
L221412 +++$+++ u969 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
L221411 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ What?
