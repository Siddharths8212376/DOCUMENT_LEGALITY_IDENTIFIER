L229438 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Oh, right, sorry.
L229437 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Tommy, we have these...
L229436 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
L229435 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Anything.
L229434 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ What kind of signal?
L229433 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me.  Guy, set up the perimeter. Tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back.
L229281 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Oh god...
L229280 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Do your best, Tommy...
L229263 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Push It. Hold it down.
L229262 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Could be this.
L229259 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ It's as far as it goes!
L229258 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!
L229254 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO!
L229253 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Where?
L229197 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Why don't you just turn it on and see?
L229196 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either.
L229170 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
L229169 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Excuse me?
L229161 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I think we're going to exit the space port.
L229160 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ What's going on?
L229071 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Twenty third quadrant of gamma sector.  I can show you on a map.
L229070 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Wh... Where are we?
L229069 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
L228946 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ And determination.
L228945 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ ... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
L228886 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I didn't say that.  I said "wouldn't it be great if we could always, work together." That's what I said.
L228885 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ You said we do appearances together, or not at all.'

L229595 +++$+++ u1044 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ LATHE +++$+++ The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
L229594 +++$+++ u1048 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ SARRIS +++$+++ Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.

L232767 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores!
L232766 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ I'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property.
L232582 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ What does she see in them?
L232581 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Unfortunately, I'll never get the chance.  I'm leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion.  Wasting my time, naturally... Look at her teasing those bumpkins.
L232580 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ I wish she was beneath me.
L232579 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
L232578 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?
L232575 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ They always say that.
L232574 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ Some say that Hessians are invincible.
L232860 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Cut those men down.  Congress is pushing ahead with your court-martial.  Benedict, trust me to handle this.
L232859 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ These men were taken from their homes at night, tried by Reed's courts -- which Congress recognizes -- and, well, you can see.
L232858 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ You go too far, Benedict.
L232857 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ They love Reed and his inquisition! I think they hope to share in his disgusting profits!  It's becoming the American way!
L232856 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Couldn't you have appealed to Congress?
L232855 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ That scum Joseph Reed... they're calling him the 'King of Pennsylvania'.  The man's a budding Cromwell.  He condemns rich Tories to death and then 'appropriates' their property for himself. Naturally, the pig hates me for every Tory I've saved.
L232787 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ The point being:  he's also a candidate for my job.  If we can pull this off, maybe I can restore their faith in me.
L232786 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
L232785 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Have you heard?  The British are negotiating to make a trade for General Lee.
L232784 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ There, then, you can have sort of a normal life.
L232783 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move.  Perhaps Martha will join me this winter.
L232782 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Gates?  He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack.  George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain.  I think you need to entertain more. Seriously!  Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt.
L232781 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ There's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga.
L232780 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ That can't be.
L232779 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships.  And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God!  Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!
L232777 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Same old story.
L232776 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats... we desperately need food.
L232773 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Exactly.  We'd attack the baggage wagons and the rear guard.  It would cause the line to buckle. Then we hit the center with our main force and cut them in half.
L232772 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ While they're strung out?
L232771 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Our plan is to hit them as they leave.
L232590 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ I?  You all know my history.
L232589 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Well, George, who were you?
L232586 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Well, truth be told?  I was a pharmacist.  Alexander?
L232585 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?
L232584 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ After visiting Congress I know what it's like being violated by come disproportionate asses!  Ah, if she only knew that the most important men in the country -- possibly the world -- are sitting at this table...
L232550 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Christ, George, Joseph Reed's been writing letters back to Congress attacking you.  Your own aide!
L232549 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ I hope I never have to believe that.
L232548 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero was right:  was is 'a time when the laws are silent'.
L232547 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.
L232546 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ The army can survive without me.
L232545 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ The army needs you.
L232542 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict.
L232541 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ What do you think, George, shall I resign?  It's what they want.
L232538 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ It is.
L232537 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Is that a fact.
L232536 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
L232535 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Go on... I want to hear everything.
L232531 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ The man's waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief.
L232530 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ We're in bad shape, Benedict, moral is low.  Before I can do anything, I need Lee and his seven thousand troops.  I've ordered him to join us three times.  In my last letter I all but begged him to come here. The man is insubordinate.
L232529 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ But trust you to do what?  One side in Congress wants compromise; another glorious battle; some surrender -- some, of course, just want power and money.  But if you don't mind my asking, George, what are your plans?
L232528 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
L232527 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
L232526 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that?  After all you've done, it's unbelievable!
L232525 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it...
L232524 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Damn-it!  You've given us a whole new season, Benedict!  And Congress thinks that the British are going to ride right over us come spring. Now half their army is back in Canada.
L232520 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ I've come to report that we've had a bit of luck!
L232519 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Arnold!
L232273 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ It comes down to leaders.  If our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe; if they go into the forests with the troops, eat what they eat, fight with them, perhaps to die?  The most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation.
L232272 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns.  Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British?
L232271 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ And a French alliance?
L232270 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.
L232269 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
L232268 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ What's your frank estimation of the British?
L232267 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Exceedingly.  Besides, if I had half the wagons that were used to lug the rum to Philadelphia for this congress, I could move a whole army to the moon!
L232266 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ You seem pleased by the prospect.
L232265 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Over three hundred miles.
L232264 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.
L232263 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ I capture Quebec leading an Army by river fordings through Maine... If we don't do it, the British will come down Champlain, take back Ticonderoga and attack us in the spring.
L232260 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga...
L232259 +++$+++ u1050 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we have an army yet?  What is happening?
L232958 +++$+++ u1051 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ BILLY LEE +++$+++ Well, general, I think I ain't got no school learning, I ain't got no trade... and I'm a drunk.  So, I think there ain't much left to be set free.
L232957 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Well, what have you thought?
L232956 +++$+++ u1051 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ BILLY LEE +++$+++ I ain't forgot about the freedom.
L232955 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Wil, I want to remind you of a conversation we started just before Monmouth...
L232850 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ You'd have money every year, so you wouldn't have to work.  You can stay at Mount Vernon as long as you want...
L232849 +++$+++ u1051 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ BILLY LEE +++$+++ No.  I guess.
L232848 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?
L232847 +++$+++ u1051 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ BILLY LEE +++$+++ Yes, general.
L232846 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ You've served me loyally, year after year, without complaining. I've thought hard about you this past winter.  I want to free you, Wil.  I want to give you your freedom, after this battle is fought.
L232845 +++$+++ u1051 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ BILLY LEE +++$+++ Yes, general?
L232844 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Wil...
L232714 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
L232713 +++$+++ u1051 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ BILLY LEE +++$+++ Me?  You apologizing to me?
L232711 +++$+++ u1051 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ BILLY LEE +++$+++ That you would have known you can trust me.
L232710 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ What?  What are you talking about?
L232709 +++$+++ u1051 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ BILLY LEE +++$+++ A lot of years have gone by.
L232708 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Misunderstood what!?
L232707 +++$+++ u1051 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ BILLY LEE +++$+++ Well... I misunderstood, then.
L232706 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
L232705 +++$+++ u1051 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ BILLY LEE +++$+++ Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
L232704 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
L232703 +++$+++ u1051 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ BILLY LEE +++$+++ You, you just need a new flint, General.
L232232 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer.
L232231 +++$+++ u1051 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ BILLY LEE +++$+++ Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
L232671 +++$+++ u1060 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ MAWHOOD +++$+++ I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...
L232670 +++$+++ u1052 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
L232669 +++$+++ u1060 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ MAWHOOD +++$+++ Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
L232668 +++$+++ u1052 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?
L232667 +++$+++ u1060 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ MAWHOOD +++$+++ Many of them, many did not possess proper arms.  My lord.
L232666 +++$+++ u1052 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
L232665 +++$+++ u1060 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ MAWHOOD +++$+++ Yes, my lord.
L232664 +++$+++ u1052 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
L232663 +++$+++ u1060 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ MAWHOOD +++$+++ No, my lord.
L232662 +++$+++ u1052 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ No uniforms.  No coats, even?  In this weather?
L232826 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Marquis!  Get these men reformed, send Steuben and Wayne out on the left...
L232825 +++$+++ u1053 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ GENERAL LEE +++$+++ That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
L232824 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Who is that!?
L232821 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ What do you know about these men!? They can stand against anything! They've seen more war than most field generals!  They are not cowards, sir!  They are not afraid!
L232820 +++$+++ u1053 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ GENERAL LEE +++$+++ The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
L232819 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?
L232802 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Lafayette will not be happy...
L232801 +++$+++ u1053 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ GENERAL LEE +++$+++ I am to take command of Major General Lafayette's division and lead the attack.
L232800 +++$+++ u1053 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ GENERAL LEE +++$+++ More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.
L232799 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.
L232968 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ You're asking me to be president of a republic, not king?  Not a dictator over subjects?
L232967 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ That's why the people trust you George.  Without someone at the convention, who has the people behind him, everything will fail. Will you do it?
L232964 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ But it's more than just that, am I right?
L232963 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
L232962 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ I'm not sure.
L232961 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?
L232936 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Well, if it's my last order, then I order them to be there!  Tell them I will give them my decision then.
L232935 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ Yes, I believe so.
L232934 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ I want to address the officers, all the officers.  Next Friday.  Can we arrange it at the mess?
L232933 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!
L232932 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ What's your advice, Alexander?
L232931 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Is this a coup?  Alexander, are you trying to tell me that I might be assassinated if I don't agree?
L232930 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.
L232929 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ To hell with Arnold...
L232928 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ George, remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold?
L232926 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ No one knows...
L232925 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ This is a declaration of insurrection!  Who wrote this!?
L232924 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions.
L232923 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ What is this?
L232909 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ I am not conscious of it, sir!  But since you have thought it necessary to tell me so, we part!
L232908 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
L232907 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ Sir, Arnold is a traitor.
L232906 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Don't lie to me, Hamilton!  If I had not court-martialed Arnold...
L232905 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ Sir, I think no such thing.
L232903 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?  Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!?  You realize what would happen if this fort fell?  The whole Hudson would be open to them!
L232902 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ Yessir.
L232901 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Colonel Hamilton.  Anyone who served under Arnold, I want them shipped north.  I don't want any troops here who served under Arnold.
L232900 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ General Greene is here.  There are two other divisions here.
L232807 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Get the body of our army up to Greene's vanguard as fast as we can.  All the damned fool has to do is hit the British rearguard and then hold for us.
L232806 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ What are we going to do?
L232756 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ They go back home to keep their families alive, stay into the spring to plant.  Then, they start coming back to us.
L232755 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ It's impossible to stop these men deserting in winter, you might as well stop geese from migrating.
L232746 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ We better, Congress invented him.
L232745 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ Are you going to keep him, sir?
L232588 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ To learn to shoot cannon?
L232587 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ I was a clerk's apprentice on Saint Croix.  But, then I went to King's College.
L232577 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ It's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for.
L232576 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ They're among the best divisions the British have.  No conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional killers.
L232400 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ But it's what he said, just before they killed him:  "I regret that I have but one life to give to my country."
L232399 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
L232398 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
L232397 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
L232396 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ And is that the most horrible thing in the world?
L232395 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ General Washington, is there actually going to be a compromise, I mean, a 'deal' with England?
L232383 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ Well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.
L232382 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ I'm so inclined.
L232381 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ Therefore, retreat.
