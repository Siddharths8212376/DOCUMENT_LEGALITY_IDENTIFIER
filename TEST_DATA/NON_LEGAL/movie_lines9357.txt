L475229 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?
L475227 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ To the other side of the street.
L475226 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Where you going?
L475219 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Like I said, women get in the way sometimes.
L475218 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
L475217 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Thanks for taking over.
L475174 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ By the way, if you ever go past the Wyatt ranch, have another talk with Elaine.
L475173 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Goodbye, Mary.
L475172 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.
L475164 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Maybe they will.
L475163 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
L475162 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Hurry up.
L475161 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.
L475159 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I can't help how I think. You're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change.
L475158 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. I don't blame you because I understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. You want your women on pedestals. But they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up.
L475155 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Fine -- maybe I'll see you there sometime.
L475154 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ It's going to Sonora.
L475153 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me.
L475149 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L475148 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I won't have you fighting over me.
L475122 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Like I said, I was thinkin' of the horses.
L475121 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
L475120 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ So grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance.
L475068 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.
L475067 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.
L475064 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ That's right -- worry about your clothes --
L475063 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ All my clothes --
L475062 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I suppose that's my fault.
L475061 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock.
L475035 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Then let's get started. The sooner I get to Sonora, the better I'll like it.
L475034 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ All right -- it's said!
L475033 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
L475032 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
L475031 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen.
L475030 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.
L475029 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean?
L475026 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What does a man usually tell a girl?
L475025 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ What?
L475024 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Tell me, darling.
L475023 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You don't mean that Clay.
L475022 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Maybe it's better that way.
L475021 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
L474981 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.
L474980 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
L474977 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ So that's it --  You think I was making fun of your girl in gingham.
L474976 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You know so much about me -- figure it out.
L474974 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.
L474973 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
L474972 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Why do you think?
L474971 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
L474967 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.
L474966 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Don't you trust me?
L474943 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ No, I'm not. All I want 'em to do is keep ahead of us -- a long way ahead. So I'm riding up the line aways to pick us out a new trail.
L474942 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You're not going out to look for them?
L474941 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.
L474940 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ It's too light yet.
L474939 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Are we leaving?
L474906 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ That's fine.
L474905 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ He knows his alphabet.
L474840 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Blonde as a new mop. And beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar.
L474839 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Will she be dark or fair?
L474838 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ But the rest is right.
L474837 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I'll make the soap myself.
L474836 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
L474835 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Go on. Tell me more about her.
L474834 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking. 
L474833 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You should know. She's in your dream.
L474832 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ The who?
L474831 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
L474830 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Thanks.
L474829 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I hope you get everything you want out of life --
L474827 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You could have treated us like they did in Aspen. No. You wouldn't do a thing like that -- it isn't in you to be mean or cruel.
L474826 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
L474825 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?
L474824 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ And it's not only because the trip's a tough one --
L474823 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I suppose it is.
L474822 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.
L474819 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I hope so, too.
L474818 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No, thanks.  I hope we won't be a burden to them.
L474817 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Coffee?
L474786 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ It's a long walk back to Aspen.
L474785 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ We can't stay here!
L474784 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Hold on.
L474783 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
L474782 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
L474781 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ So that was why she tried to run away.
L474712 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ No, Ma'am, we can't. We can get a roof and a fire and maybe Mrs. Wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people.
L474711 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
L474710 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ But the nearest shelter's the Wyatt ranch and that's maybe five hours away.
L474689 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ His letters will keep.
L474688 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ They're stragglin'.
L474687 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
L474686 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
L474684 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Yeah. While the horses wander all over the country.
L474683 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ He's learning his letters.
L474682 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Get back to the horses. They're straggling.
L474630 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Like sticking his nose into other people's business.
L474629 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Like what?
L474626 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ That why you always took him on the other side of the street?
L474625 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Yeah.
L474624 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ There's a nice boy.
L474596 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Go on, there's a good boy.
L474595 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Would you, Mr. Phillips?
L474594 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire.
L474592 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.
L474591 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?
L474585 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
L474584 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.
L474549 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
L474548 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Where do you keep the can opener?
L474547 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
L474546 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ But you eat, don't you?
L474545 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
L474544 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
L474538 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
L474537 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ So am I.
L474524 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
L474523 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ And this is Helen Carter.
L474513 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
L474512 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ What's the matter with her?
L474509 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
L474508 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Our kind of women?
L474504 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.
L474503 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
L474502 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You can stay here if you like.
L474501 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
L474500 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
L474499 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You can't leave us here.
L474498 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
L474497 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ They won't be riding in the wagon.
L474490 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Just about.
L474489 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ As far as -- Sonora?
L474488 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.
L474485 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
L474484 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ And this is Helen Carter.
L474483 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.
L474482 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ This must have been in the family a long time.
L474479 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
L474478 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ What's the matter with her?
L474477 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No. We came down the hill a little fast and...  ...the wheel broke.  Can you fix it for us?
L474476 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Anybody hurt?
L474569 +++$+++ u2622 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ Hello, Miss Wells.
L474568 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Here's a man says he's looking for you girls.
L474565 +++$+++ u2622 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ She's a friend -- took off this morning sort of sudden while I wasn't around.
L474564 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ So did I. They were in it.
L474563 +++$+++ u2622 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ I found their surrey --
L474562 +++$+++ u2622 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ A fellow sees a fire go out all of a sudden, he don't take chances. My name's Clayton and I'm looking for someone.
L474561 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
L474560 +++$+++ u2622 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
L474898 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ No they won't.
L474897 +++$+++ u2623 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
L474896 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I can't --
L474535 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ How's that?
L474534 +++$+++ u2623 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Which ranch?
L474533 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Stretch out under the seat, Miss.
L474518 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ It wouldn't happen to be this...
L474517 +++$+++ u2623 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I -- lost something.
L475209 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Well, then, I know it takes three -- four weeks for you to come round to admit when you're wrong... But by that time she's liable to be in China...
L475208 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
L475207 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
L475206 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.
L475205 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
L475204 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You'll live.
L475203 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Kind of sore.
L475202 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ How's that?
L475188 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I just wondered. Let's go.
L475187 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Sure. What other reason would there be?
L475186 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Is that the only reason you came back?
L475185 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
L475184 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ What did you come back for?
L475182 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.
L475181 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Half of them are mine.
L475179 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You want to split up? --
L475178 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ It is so your fault and... and I guess maybe when we hit the ranch... you andme better...
L475177 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ She told me not to fight with you anymore. She said it wasn't your fault, but -- I figure different...
L475176 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I don't care what she asked you.
L475175 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ You know what she asked me?
L475143 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ You think you're so slmighty -- smart -- Who are you to sit up there and say nobody's good enough for you, like you said yesterday -- just because a man kisses a woman --
L475142 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I said keep your nose out of my life. No kid is going to tell me how to run it.
L475141 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Maybe I haven't lived as long as you have, but I know a sight more about people and I wouldn't talk to a mule like you talked to her and, if I did, I'd say how sorry I was. I'd be man enough to do that.
L475140 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
L475139 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
L475138 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
L475137 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Go on, hit me.
L475135 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ What makes you think you're so almighty? Telling people what to do and how to act when you don't even know how yourself.
L475134 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
L475133 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
L475132 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.
L475130 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life.
L475129 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires.
L475127 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You better start.
L475126 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ I didn't stop to think, Clay.
L474995 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Just the grub box and bed rolls.
L474994 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
L474933 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ There's a lot of things I don't see any sense to. But make up your mind. Learn to read or --  -- go back and watch the horses.
L474932 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to.
L474931 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Don't go arguing with your teacher.
L474912 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ There's only two of them now.
L474911 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Finished, son?
L474910 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody.
