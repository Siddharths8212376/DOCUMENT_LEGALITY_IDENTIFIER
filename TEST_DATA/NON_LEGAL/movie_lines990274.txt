L486717 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ No you didn't.
L486716 +++$+++ u7512 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ MR. PRESCOTT +++$+++ I heard screaming.
L486715 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Can you knock?
L486714 +++$+++ u7512 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ MR. PRESCOTT +++$+++ Are you okay?
L486803 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Twice.
L486802 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ I thought Blockbuster fired you.
L486801 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Working, thank you.
L486800 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
L486799 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
L486798 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Stu was with me last night.
L487530 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ You got it.
L487529 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.
L487414 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it.
L487413 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Don't come any closer.
L487412 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Don't shoot. It's me.
L487411 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Stop. Right there.
L487265 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ She's the Scream Queen.
L487264 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?
L487421 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ No, Sid.
L487420 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.
L487419 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
L487418 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.
L487352 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ I'll be right back.
L487351 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Yeah.
L487350 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Wanna another beer?
L487349 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie -- you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say "I'll be right back."
L487345 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit.
L487344 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
L487315 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Like you had one.
L487314 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ There goes my chance with Sid.
L487313 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ He came to make up.
L487312 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ What's Leatherface doing here?
L487281 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ I can cry on cue.
L487280 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly.
L487263 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
L487262 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ I thought everything was checked out.
L487191 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ It's 1995 -- motives are incidental.
L487190 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ And what would be your motive?
L487189 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect.
L487185 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition.
L487184 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Which is you...
L487183 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...
L487182 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
L487181 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
L487180 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ She's saving herself for you.
L487179 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
L487178 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ So what's his reason?
L487177 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.
L487176 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?
L487175 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Because, obviously they don't watch enough movies. This is standard horror movie stuff. PROM NIGHT revisited.
L487174 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ The why'd the police let him go?
L487173 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
L487172 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
L487171 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section?
L487170 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ What?
L487169 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
L487168 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ You coming tonight?
L487167 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ We had a run in the mass murder section.
L487166 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Jesus, this place is packed.
L486808 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Did you really put her liver in the mailbox? I hear they found her liver in the mailbox.
L486807 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
L486806 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Besides --  "Takes a man to do something like that."
L486797 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ It would certainly improve your high school Q.
L486796 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
L486795 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ And are the police aware you dated the victim?
L486792 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Before she dumped him for Steve.
L486791 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ For about two seconds.
L486781 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that.
L486780 +++$+++ u7513 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ That was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.
L487516 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.
L487515 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?
L487459 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ You'll never get away with this.
L487458 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ The official term is "psychotic".
L487457 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ You're crazy -- both of you.
L487450 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ It's all part of the game.
L487449 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Why are you doing this?
L487448 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
L487309 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
L487308 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
L487139 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.
L487138 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Yeah, okay... whatever.
L487137 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Remember, there's safety in numbers.
L487133 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us, hangin'.
L487132 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Are you serious?
L487131 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house.
L487047 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
L487046 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Why are they doing this?
L486790 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
L486789 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
L487236 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Deal.
L487235 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.
L487234 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
L487233 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ TATUM!
L487232 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
L487231 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?
L487230 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."
L487229 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ No way.
L487228 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on.
L487227 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
L487226 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.
L487225 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Who?
L487224 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.
L487223 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ What do you think about when you're having sex?
L487222 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
L487221 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
L487220 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
L487219 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.
L487202 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.
L487201 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Is Billy going to be there tonight?
L487197 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Oh, god...
L487196 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?
L487155 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Come on, let's rock.
L487154 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
L487153 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.
L487152 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there.
L487151 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Well... you can only hear that Richard Gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it.
L487150 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ And you believe it?
L487149 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
L487148 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
L487147 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
L487146 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
L487145 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
L487144 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ So you think my mom was a slut too?
L487143 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.
L487136 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Come on. Pathos has it's perks.
L487135 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I don't know...
L487134 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ This could be good. What do you think, Sid?
L487126 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ It was him, Tatum. I know it.
L487125 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
L487041 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Just ignore him. You had good reason to think what you did.
L487040 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I bet he's pissed.
L487039 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Shit, what is he doing here?
L487038 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
L487037 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
L487032 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now.
L487031 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here.
L486990 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Just a sec... I need to talk to someone.
L486989 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Come on, Sid.
L486962 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ It's alright. I'll get it.
L486961 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Take a message.
L486956 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ I knew this guy was too perfect. He was destined to have a flaw.
L486955 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ He was there, Tatum.
L486954 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Do you really think Billy did it?
L486953 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ No, nothing's like it used to be.
L486952 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Just like old times, ain't it?
L486951 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
L486886 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
L486885 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
L486828 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Bye.
L486827 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Whatever. Just hurry.
L486826 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
L486825 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I'm not worried.
L486824 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
L486823 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ It's past seven.
L486822 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
L486818 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Later.
L486817 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Thanks, Tatum.
L486816 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ I'll be there by seven. I promise
L486815 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
L486814 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
L486813 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Tell your mom I said thanks.
L486812 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
L486811 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.
L486783 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ How do you gut someone?
L486782 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Or a man's mentality.
L486756 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ They don't know. Dewey said this is the worst crime they've ever seen. Even worse than...  Well it's bad. They're bringing in the feds. This is big.
L486755 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ They think it's school-related?
L486754 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
L486753 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Do they know who did it?
L486752 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
L486751 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
L486750 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
L486749 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ No way.
L486748 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.
