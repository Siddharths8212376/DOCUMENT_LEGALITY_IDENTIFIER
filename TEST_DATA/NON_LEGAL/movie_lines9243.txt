L361004 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ We're getting whacked.
L361003 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
L361002 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Where?
L361001 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ He wants to see us now.
L361000 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ What's up?
L360999 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Hi.  It's Ruiz.  Yeah. So the driver knows where to go? When? We'll be down in five. No, I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye.
L360996 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ She was jonesing for me.
L360995 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What the fuck was that about?
L360990 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ I swear to God, I didn't do anything.
L360989 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What the hell did you do?
L360976 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah, I know how you do. I know how you do. I've heard your kibbles and bits all fucking night. You've been shaking your ass like an unemployed clown. How the room's a boiling pot of sugar water. How you're gonna dip a string into it and make rockcandy. Who wants to play 'Just the tip?' Dancing around like a smacked ass. Oh, and that coat check girl you've been dragging around as 'insurance' doesn't even speak English. 
L360975 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Dude, get back out there. You gotta help me get them in the hot tub.  Hang on girls! Just get out there. I'll be right out. You know how I do.
L360974 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What the fuck's going on?
L360940 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Damn right. Bring us two bottles of Dom Champs and here, take fifty in case I call you bitch later when I'm drunk.  Siddown, motherfucker.  'Sex and paychecks.'
L360939 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
L360938 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Look who's back? Want some champagne?
L360936 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Fine.
L360935 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
L360934 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ You got that right.
L360933 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
L360932 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Work's over. I'm gonna party.
L360931 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You fucking nuts?

L360929 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Where do you think you're going?
L360928 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Fuck this.
L360927 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
L360926 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ You too?
L360925 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Why you gotta make everything difficult?
L360924 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ About what?
L360923 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You happy?
L360871 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ So we're working?
L360870 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah.
L360828 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You would think.
L360827 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ He woulda told us right?
L360826 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Like I said, I don't know.
L360825 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ So is this the drop?
L360810 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?
L360809 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
L360808 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.
L360807 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Yeah. What vibe?
L360806 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What did I 'get?'
L360805 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him?
L360804 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Missing what? He didn't say shit.
L360803 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
L360802 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I don't know.
L360801 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ This shit's sketchy. Why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else?
L360774 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
L360773 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ You know this guy?
L360771 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You got something to say --
L360770 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ I mean, that's what I heard --
L360769 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What the fuck is that supposed --
L360768 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
L360767 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You just don't fucking get it, do you?
L360766 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
L360765 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
L360764 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy.
L360763 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Motherfucker...
L360762 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Sold it, stole it, whatever...
L360761 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You sold it? I thought they stole it.
L360760 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van.
L360759 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are.
L360758 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Don't even start.
L360757 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What the fuck do you have to complain about?
L360756 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What the fuck do you...
L360755 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ This is bullshit, man.
L360754 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
L360753 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ So they said more than the address.
L360752 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ They asked who it was.
L360751 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ How'd they know who you were?
L360750 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Nothing.
L360749 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Nothing else.
L360748 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I told you what they said.
L360747 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ They didn't say an address?
L360746 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
L360745 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ What exactly did they say?
L360735 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Fuck...
L360734 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Shit. It's thirty-five cents. You got a dime?
L360720 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Well, I don't want to walk.
L360719 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
L360718 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ You think Maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager? We gotta represent him by showing some class. The man's got an operation. How does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?
L360717 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
L360716 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
L360715 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I know you're not calling Jimmy.
L360714 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ What are you doing?
L360713 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What are you doing?
L360712 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about.
L360711 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
L360710 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
L360709 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Oh really. Why's that?
L360708 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
L360707 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
L360706 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
L360705 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
L360704 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
L360703 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Great. On my fucking room.
L360702 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Yeah, I guess.
L360701 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Jesus, man. Plus ten?
L360700 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Forty-six.
L360699 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ How much was it?
L360698 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
L360697 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ How much is it?
L360696 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
L360695 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ C'mon, man...
L360694 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Shhh... Hello, room service?
L360693 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Who you calling?
L360625 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah. He said that's our account with the car service.
L360624 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ You sure?
L360623 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ 'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
L360622 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No. Look. There.
L360621 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Maybe we should call for a cab.
L360620 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Shit. No new pages. I don't even know where the fuck we're supposed to go.
L360611 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Oh, I'll represent alright.
L360610 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
L360609 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
L360608 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
L360607 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here.
L360591 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Nah, don't bother --
L360590 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ I'll get the girl.
L360589 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What's the movie?
L360588 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets.
L360587 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Pretty nice.
L360586 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Holy shit. Can you believe this?
L360561 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ To keep?
L360560 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ It's ours.
L360504 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ She really liked the kitchen.
L360503 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Is that the woman from..?
L360502 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Right here's fine.
L360501 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ This paint sucks. The white shows through.
L360500 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I don't know.
L360499 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Who's driving her?
L360498 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Max won't let me drive Jess to dance anymore.
L360494 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ I'm not painting the fu --, I'm not painting the ashtray. And frogs aren't purple.
L360493 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ She wants you to paint the ashtray.
L360492 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ What? Did she say something?
L360482 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Why not? I grew up in bars. It's fun for a kid.
L360481 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'm not taking her to a bar.
L360480 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.
L360479 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I promised Chloe we'd come here.
L360478 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
L360470 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ See? Now everyone's got one on.  What do you got there?
L360469 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
L360468 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
L360467 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer --
L360464 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Seat belt.
L360463 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
L360462 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ How'd you unlock my phone?
L360461 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
L360460 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Nice work.
L360459 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I like it.
L360458 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ It's not even yours.
L360457 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I like it.
L360456 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
L360455 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I gotta pick up the baby.
L360454 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
L360453 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
L360452 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Who is this fucking Ruiz?
L360451 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
L360450 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ What are we delivering?
L360449 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
L360448 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Fuck him.
L360447 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
L360446 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ We'll kill Fairfax this year.
L360445 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ We look good this year.
L360439 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Sorry coach.
L360438 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Sorry coach.
L360436 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ I'll beat your ass --
L360435 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You wanna go right now?
L360434 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Please. I got three inches on you. You wouldn't have landed a punch if I didn't let you.
L360433 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Bullshit...
L360432 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Shit. Who we kidding? I know I suck, and I held you up for ten rounds --
L360431 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow.
L360430 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Damn right, I have. You think I like living on fucking Yucca? We do a good job on this, we're in.
L360429 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
L360428 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ This is the opportunity of a lifetime. What are you? Nuts? You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
L360427 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You don't imply about something like that. You lay it out on the table. Besides, I'm not taking the job.
L360426 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ He implied it.
L360425 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ He didn't say we need guns.
L360424 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ I think we might.
L360423 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ We don't need guns.
