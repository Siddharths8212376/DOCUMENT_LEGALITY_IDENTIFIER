L399383 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
L399382 +++$+++ u6719 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I'm just offering a place to stay.
L399381 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
L399380 +++$+++ u6719 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place.
L399379 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
L399378 +++$+++ u6719 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Will you meet with him?
L399377 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ You gotta be kidding?
L399376 +++$+++ u6719 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
L399375 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
L399374 +++$+++ u6719 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ It's been a very strange day.
L399373 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Cynthia...what's going on?
L399372 +++$+++ u6719 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.
L399371 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
L399370 +++$+++ u6719 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
L399369 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ The Cowboy??
L399368 +++$+++ u6719 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
L399367 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Beverly Hills Hotel. I've got enough cash in my pocket for one night.
L399366 +++$+++ u6719 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
L399365 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ But I'm not broke.
L399364 +++$+++ u6719 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ You're broke!
L399363 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ And?
L399362 +++$+++ u6719 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.
L399361 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ What do you mean "you know"?
L399360 +++$+++ u6719 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I know.  Where are you Adam?
L399359 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Someone's shut off my money!
L399268 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I'm going home. I'll call you later.
L399267 +++$+++ u6719 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
L399266 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I'm going home Cynthia.
L399265 +++$+++ u6719 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
L399264 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I'm going home.
L399263 +++$+++ u6719 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
L399262 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ No.
L399261 +++$+++ u6719 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!
L399260 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Who fired everyone?
L399259 +++$+++ u6719 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ They fired everyone.
L399258 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ What did you say?
L399257 +++$+++ u6719 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
L399256 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ What's going on, Cynthia?
L399255 +++$+++ u6719 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Adam, where are you?
L399181 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ And you'd better speak to someone too ... or find yourself another client!! This smells like a set-up to me!  And by the way, Ray, I don't know who these guys are kidding, but every foot of film I've shot is in a vault at the lab that only I can access. No one's getting that film!!
L399180 +++$+++ u6732 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'll speak to someone.
L399179 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ You'd better fix this, Ray!!!
L399162 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
L399161 +++$+++ u6732 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.
L399142 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ So why did you idiots bring me here? ... I'm in the middle of making a picture.
L399141 +++$+++ u6732 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ There is no problem.
L399140 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ So what's the problem?
L399417 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Okay.
L399416 +++$+++ u6718 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COWBOY +++$+++ No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
L399415 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
L399414 +++$+++ u6718 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COWBOY +++$+++ You're an understandin' fella.
L399413 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I understand.
L399412 +++$+++ u6718 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COWBOY +++$+++ Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
L399411 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ It will work out.
L399410 +++$+++ u6718 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COWBOY +++$+++ Now I know a few things. I know you have had a rough day. You're probably thinkin' I don't know the half of it, but in actual fact I know every part of it. The business of gittin' thrown off your movie, the heartache of seeing your wife with another man... losin' access to that precious film vault...
L399409 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Okay.
L399408 +++$+++ u6718 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COWBOY +++$+++ So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
L399407 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ One.
L399406 +++$+++ u6718 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COWBOY +++$+++ There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
L399405 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
L399404 +++$+++ u6718 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COWBOY +++$+++ No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?
L399403 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Okay, I'm thinking.
L399402 +++$+++ u6718 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COWBOY +++$+++ Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?
L399401 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ How's that?
L399400 +++$+++ u6718 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COWBOY +++$+++ So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
L399399 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
L399398 +++$+++ u6718 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COWBOY +++$+++ What did I say?
L399397 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I agree with what you said...truly.
L399396 +++$+++ u6718 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COWBOY +++$+++ Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
L399395 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Sure.
L399394 +++$+++ u6718 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COWBOY +++$+++ A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
L399393 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Whatever.
L399392 +++$+++ u6718 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COWBOY +++$+++ Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
L399391 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ No problem. What's on your mind?
L399390 +++$+++ u6718 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COWBOY +++$+++ Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.
L399389 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Yeah.
L399388 +++$+++ u6718 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COWBOY +++$+++ Beautiful night.
L399387 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Howdy to you.
L399386 +++$+++ u6718 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COWBOY +++$+++ Howdy!
L399358 +++$+++ u6726 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ HOTEL MANAGER +++$+++ Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
L399357 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
L399356 +++$+++ u6726 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ HOTEL MANAGER +++$+++ That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
L399355 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
L399354 +++$+++ u6726 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ HOTEL MANAGER +++$+++ Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
L399353 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ So, what did they say?
L399352 +++$+++ u6726 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ HOTEL MANAGER +++$+++ I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
L399351 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ How...  how'd they know I was here?
L399350 +++$+++ u6726 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ HOTEL MANAGER +++$+++ The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
L399349 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ ... What??
L399348 +++$+++ u6726 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ HOTEL MANAGER +++$+++ I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
L399347 +++$+++ u6714 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Yes...what is it?
L399483 +++$+++ u6717 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COCO +++$+++ Good luck, honey!
L399482 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Right. See ya.
L399481 +++$+++ u6717 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COCO +++$+++ Get going. You don't want to be late.
L399480 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Thanks Coco. I'll let you know.
L399479 +++$+++ u6717 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COCO +++$+++ Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
L399478 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
L399477 +++$+++ u6717 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COCO +++$+++ His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
L399476 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
L399475 +++$+++ u6717 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COCO +++$+++ It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
L399474 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
L399454 +++$+++ u6717 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COCO +++$+++ Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
L399453 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You're really something Coco...thank you.
L399451 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Not really. I met her in junior college and she was from this other town.
L399450 +++$+++ u6717 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COCO +++$+++ So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
L399449 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.
L399448 +++$+++ u6717 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COCO +++$+++ Sweetie, look at me straight.
L399447 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...
L399446 +++$+++ u6717 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COCO +++$+++ She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
L399445 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I was afraid of that.
L399444 +++$+++ u6717 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COCO +++$+++ Your Aunt called me.
L399105 +++$+++ u6717 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COCO +++$+++ You got it! See you later honey.
L399104 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
L399103 +++$+++ u6717 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COCO +++$+++ Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
L399102 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Wow!
L399101 +++$+++ u6717 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COCO +++$+++ I told ya.
L399100 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It's unbelievable!
L399099 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I can hardly wait, Coco.
L399098 +++$+++ u6717 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COCO +++$+++ That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
L399097 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No, I don't.
L399095 +++$+++ u6717 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COCO +++$+++ Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
L399094 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I guess I've come to quite a place.
L399093 +++$+++ u6717 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COCO +++$+++ Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.
L399092 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
L399091 +++$+++ u6717 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COCO +++$+++ You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
L399090 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I...
L399089 +++$+++ u6717 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COCO +++$+++ You don't have to tell me. It's written all over that pretty face of yours.. You came here to be an actress. I just hope you'll remember there's never been a great poem called "tits and ass."
L399088 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Well, I ...
L399087 +++$+++ u6717 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COCO +++$+++ Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
L399086 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Yes, he is. He raises corn.
L399085 +++$+++ u6717 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ COCO +++$+++ I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
L399116 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
L399115 +++$+++ u6721 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ DARK-HAIRED WOMAN +++$+++ My name is Rita.
L399114 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
L399113 +++$+++ u6721 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ DARK-HAIRED WOMAN +++$+++ I think so. I was just taking a shower.
L399112 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Are you okay?
L399111 +++$+++ u6721 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ DARK-HAIRED WOMAN +++$+++ A car ... a car accident.
L399110 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry.   Are you all right?
L399109 +++$+++ u6721 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ DARK-HAIRED WOMAN +++$+++ There was an accident. I came here.
L399108 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.
L399107 +++$+++ u6721 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ DARK-HAIRED WOMAN +++$+++ That's okay.
L399513 +++$+++ u6735 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?
L399512 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No, no, I'm fine.
L399511 +++$+++ u6735 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
L399510 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Hi.
L399505 +++$+++ u6735 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.
L399504 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Very pleased to meet you.
L399503 +++$+++ u6735 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.
L399502 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Yes.
L399501 +++$+++ u6735 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Betty Elms?
L399538 +++$+++ u6727 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Before what?
L399537 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...
L399532 +++$+++ u6727 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ But you won't.
L399531 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I can call them... I can call my dad.
L399526 +++$+++ u6727 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.
L399525 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You're still here?
L399522 +++$+++ u6727 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.
L399521 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Betty.
L399518 +++$+++ u6727 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I want to play this one close, Bob. Like it was with that girl, what's her name, with the black hair. That felt good. Whaddya think?
L399517 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What?
L399516 +++$+++ u6727 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
L399305 +++$+++ u6734 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ SERGEANT BAXTER +++$+++ May I have your name please?
L399304 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Was anyone hurt?
L399303 +++$+++ u6734 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ SERGEANT BAXTER +++$+++ No. I can't.
L399302 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Can you tell me what happened?
L399301 +++$+++ u6734 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ SERGEANT BAXTER +++$+++ Yes, there was.
L399300 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
L399607 +++$+++ u6730 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN +++$+++ I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.
L399606 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Well ... we'll leave her a note.
L399605 +++$+++ u6730 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN +++$+++ I switched apartments with her. She's in #17. Just walk down that way. It's just to the right.
L399604 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ But it said #12.
L399603 +++$+++ u6730 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN +++$+++ Number 17.
L399602 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Diane?
L399601 +++$+++ u6730 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN +++$+++ Yes?
L399625 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Hey, let's introduce the brand new you to Hollywood. We haven't seen the roof garden yet.
L399624 +++$+++ u6733 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
L399623 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
L399622 +++$+++ u6733 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ But I want to.
L399621 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.
L399615 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I know what you have to do, but let me do it.
L399614 +++$+++ u6733 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ What ... I..HAVE... to do.
L399613 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Rita... I know what you're doing.
L399611 +++$+++ u6733 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ No.
L399610 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
L399609 +++$+++ u6733 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ I don't think...
L399598 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Keep going. Go around to the back.
L399597 +++$+++ u6733 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ No... but...
L399596 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Do you know them?!
L399595 +++$+++ u6733 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Those men in front, in the car.
L399594 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What is it? What do you see?!
L399593 +++$+++ u6733 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Don't stop!
L399591 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You're not going to get in trouble. You're going to find out who you are. Finding out who you are gets you out of trouble.
L399590 +++$+++ u6733 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
L399589 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
L399473 +++$+++ u6733 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Okay.
L399472 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
L399471 +++$+++ u6733 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Good luck!
L399470 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke. 
L399456 +++$+++ u6715 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!
L399455 +++$+++ u6733 +++$+++ m448 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?
