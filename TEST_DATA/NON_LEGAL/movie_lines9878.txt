L256808 +++$+++ u5667 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARCELLA +++$+++ That's going to cost.
L256807 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ And not show it to me. Ever again.
L256806 +++$+++ u5667 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARCELLA +++$+++ All of it?
L256805 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
L256804 +++$+++ u5667 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARCELLA +++$+++ It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
L256803 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
L256802 +++$+++ u5667 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARCELLA +++$+++ This?
L256801 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Throw that away.
L256776 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Patch him through....
L256775 +++$+++ u5667 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARCELLA +++$+++ Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
L256774 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ ...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.
L256924 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I have always thought about her and missed her.
L256923 +++$+++ u5669 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
L256922 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Yeah...
L256921 +++$+++ u5669 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Take care of her. She's a keeper.
L256920 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
L256919 +++$+++ u5669 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Of course you will.
L256918 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I think I'll go see Debi today.
L256917 +++$+++ u5669 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
L256916 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Yeah. I guess we did.
L256915 +++$+++ u5669 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ We had a good laugh, didn't we?
L256914 +++$+++ u5669 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You don't have a headache. I have a headache.
L256913 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ No, I don't have one.
L256912 +++$+++ u5669 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I have a headache. You have a headache?
L256911 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ You have a headache?
L256910 +++$+++ u5669 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
L256909 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
L256908 +++$+++ u5669 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Nature made him then broke the mold.
L256907 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
L256906 +++$+++ u5669 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I spoke to your father the other day.
L256905 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ It's good to see you. I'm sure you're curious about what I've been doing.
L256904 +++$+++ u5669 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ His assistant. He acted like Marlin's son, only he wasn't. At least they never said he was... I bet they were lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers. Wild Kingdom my ass!
L256903 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Jim?
L256902 +++$+++ u5669 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Marlin Perkins and Jim!
L256901 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ It's a place where religious people--
L256900 +++$+++ u5669 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What's a revival tent?
L256899 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ That's wonderful, Mom.
L256898 +++$+++ u5669 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I bought a new rug.
L257315 +++$+++ u5672 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ See you in ten years.
L257314 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
L257313 +++$+++ u5672 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Work's good for the soul.
L257312 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I have to get my head back into my work.
L257311 +++$+++ u5672 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ That's too bad.
L257310 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ It didn't work out.
L257308 +++$+++ u5672 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ As long as you had a good time.
L257307 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
L257306 +++$+++ u5672 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What the hell happened to you?
L257034 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Mein Dealer.
L257033 +++$+++ u5672 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ He gave me a great deal.
L257032 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
L257031 +++$+++ u5672 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ He sold me this bad boy.
L257030 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ He sells BMW's?
L257028 +++$+++ u5672 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Thank you.
L257027 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.
L257026 +++$+++ u5672 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Ten years. What happened!?
L257025 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ No.
L257024 +++$+++ u5672 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
L257023 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ No. You drove us here.
L257022 +++$+++ u5672 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
L257021 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Debi's house.
L257005 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ You too.
L257004 +++$+++ u5672 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ God it's great to see you.
L257003 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Fair enough.
L257002 +++$+++ u5672 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
L257001 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ So what happened to you?
L256996 +++$+++ u5672 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You're leaving me hanging here...
L256995 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Paul?
L256994 +++$+++ u5672 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Marty! It's me. Paul.
L257013 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Wow.
L257012 +++$+++ u5673 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ SOUTHTEC GUARD +++$+++ Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course...
L257011 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ How did you get this job?
L257010 +++$+++ u5673 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ SOUTHTEC GUARD +++$+++ To shoot you. Correct.
L257009 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.
L257008 +++$+++ u5673 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ SOUTHTEC GUARD +++$+++ Well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot. But our customers need a little more than just that, you understand? This badge doesn't mean that I am a peace officer.
L257007 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ So when are you authorized to use deadly force?
L257144 +++$+++ u5671 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MR. NEWBERRY +++$+++ That's good.
L257143 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I'm a professional killer.
L257142 +++$+++ u5671 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MR. NEWBERRY +++$+++ So what are you doing with your life now, son?
L257141 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Why not?
L257140 +++$+++ u5671 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MR. NEWBERRY +++$+++ Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?
L257139 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
L257138 +++$+++ u5671 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MR. NEWBERRY +++$+++ I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
L257137 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ How's that?
L257136 +++$+++ u5671 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MR. NEWBERRY +++$+++ Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
L257135 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ How are you? How's business?
L257134 +++$+++ u5671 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MR. NEWBERRY +++$+++ Good evening, Mr. Blank.
L257133 +++$+++ u5668 +++$+++ m375 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Good evening, Mr. Newberry.
L258916 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Why?
L258915 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ The point was to love each other.
L258914 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?
L258911 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Why?
L258910 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I don't know any other way, Annie.
L258906 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
L258905 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set.
L258903 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I can't do this. I can't leave you...
L258902 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
L258901 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I don't care! We'd be together.
L258900 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Summers are short here, Annie. There isn't much of a fall. Before you know it, the roads are closed... the nights get long.
L258899 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ One more time.
L258898 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Annie!
L258897 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Show me again.
L258890 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Ssshhh...  Stand still, Annie. Takes what we've got, just for now. Can you do that?
L258889 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, God, what are we going to do? I'm supposed to --
L258888 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I won't ask you to.
L258887 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody.
L258848 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What?!
L258847 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.
L258767 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Tom.
L258766 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ This is Mr. Booker, Robert.
L258616 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Huh?
L258615 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You missed a button.
L258614 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Ha, ha... all right, well, uh I guess you can bring out the pasta.
L258613 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I am comfortable.
L258612 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Just make yourself comfortable.
L258611 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
L258610 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Everything under control?
L258587 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ How did you find out all that?
L258586 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
L258585 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
L258584 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...
L258583 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
L258582 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Ever think of moving there full time?
L258581 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It is. It's lovely.
L258580 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Grace told me you have a country house in Connecticut. Sounds like a beautiful place.
L258579 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
L258578 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Why didn't it work out?
L258576 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
L258575 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ How did you meet her?
L258574 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.
L258573 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Son?
L258572 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Five years. My son was born here.
L258571 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ How long did you live here with your wife?
L258566 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ OK.
L258565 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
L258564 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L258563 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Feel good?
L258562 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Thanks.
L258561 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat.
L258560 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
L258559 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ OK. I'll stop talking then.
L258558 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
L258557 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
L258556 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra.
L258555 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
L258554 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
L258553 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Poor thing.
L258552 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
L258551 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ The answer's no.
L258514 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I can handle it!
L258513 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Need a lift?
L258512 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Shit.
L258511 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You too.
L258510 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Enjoy the day.
L258509 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.
L258508 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Are you shy, Mr. Booker?
L258505 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ She did?
L258504 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
L258503 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ He's beautiful.
L258502 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh yes. I forgot.
L258501 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
L258500 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I have a way with animals.
L258499 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I thought you were an editor, not a reporter?
L258498 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I thought you lived in Chicago?
L258497 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
L258496 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.
L258494 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I don't sleep all right anywhere. But the house is fine.
L258493 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You sleeping all right in that house?
L258492 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
L258491 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
L258490 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
L258489 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ A jogger, huh?
L258488 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.
L258474 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Just who's been laughing at who here?
L258473 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, I, uh... you didn't...
L258472 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He played Rachmaninov's Vocalize Opus 34. No. 14. It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I ever heard. I actually forgot where I was for a time.  You seem surprised?
L258471 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You were married to a woman in Chicago?
L258470 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ When I was first married.
L258469 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You lived in Chicago?
L258468 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Does Chicago count?
L258467 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.
L258466 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ What's that to miss?
L258465 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
L258464 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
L258463 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
L258462 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
L258461 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.
L258460 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You stand still too long in New York you get hit by a bicycle messenger.  You know, sometimes, I get the feeling, Mr. Booker, that you're laughing at me. Why is that?
L258459 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You ever just stand still for a minute?
L258458 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What?
L258455 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.
L258454 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ So how was your first and last day of branding?
L258411 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It is cocktail hour yet?
L258410 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You okay?
L258391 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Branding?  I haven't branded in years.
L258390 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You know, we're branding here tomorrow. If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome.
L258355 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ That's up to Pilgrim.
L258354 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
L258353 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I don't have a problem with that. It's up to Annie.
L258273 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Excuse me, with all due respect, but this is her decision, not yours. And I don't want to waste anybody's time -- mostly mine.
L258272 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Look, I'll talk to Grace and call you later--
