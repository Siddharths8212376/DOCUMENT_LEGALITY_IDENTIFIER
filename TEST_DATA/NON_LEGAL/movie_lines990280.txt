L496033 +++$+++ u7549 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MRS. LINDNER +++$+++ I don't know all about what happened back then.  But it always stood between me and my husband.
L496032 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ But what is the truth?
L496031 +++$+++ u7549 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MRS. LINDNER +++$+++ That's alright.  Don't misunderstand my husband.  It's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. And who would believe him if he told the truth?
L496030 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Thank you.  Elisabeth, I didn't mean to...
L496029 +++$+++ u7549 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MRS. LINDNER +++$+++ Frank Kosinski.  Here's the address.  Go see him.  Ask him.
L496016 +++$+++ u7549 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MRS. LINDNER +++$+++ Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired.
L496015 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ I really hate to bother him, but...
L496013 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Thank you.
L496012 +++$+++ u7549 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MRS. LINDNER +++$+++ Oh, Ellen!  I've been wondering when you'd come.  Why don't you step in.
L495937 +++$+++ u7549 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MRS. LINDNER +++$+++ You're doing fine, aren't you?  I mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor.
L495936 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Ellen.
L496022 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
L496021 +++$+++ u7547 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ LINDNER +++$+++ Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.
L496020 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ 1976.  What happened back then?
L496019 +++$+++ u7547 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ LINDNER +++$+++ You know, after doing that job for so many years, you learn to appreciate the simple things in life.  Flowers incorporate a beauty that I always missed in life.  But certainly, you're not here to chat about my hobbies.
L495855 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Wait, won't you join me for a cup of coffee?
L495854 +++$+++ u7547 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ LINDNER +++$+++ I guess it's too lonely for most folks.  It's time for me to get going. It's been a pleasure meeting you.
L495852 +++$+++ u7547 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ LINDNER +++$+++ Village gossip.  You're a real attraction here.
L495851 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Do I look like it that much?
L495850 +++$+++ u7547 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ LINDNER +++$+++ It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?
L495849 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Ellen Straub.
L495848 +++$+++ u7547 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ LINDNER +++$+++ You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
L495847 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ No, I've never seen him before.
L495846 +++$+++ u7547 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ LINDNER +++$+++ Does this dog here belong to you?
L495845 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Hello.  Can I help you?
L496112 +++$+++ u7551 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ PROF. ROTH +++$+++ We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
L496111 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...
L496109 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ I think I've killed him.  Martin, my husband, I've killed him!  That is, I'm not sure, but...
L496108 +++$+++ u7551 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ PROF. ROTH +++$+++ What?
L496107 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ I've killed my husband!
L496106 +++$+++ u7551 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ PROF. ROTH +++$+++ Mrs. Straub!
L495894 +++$+++ u7551 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ PROF. ROTH +++$+++ A tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and, thus, influence your perception.
L495893 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ And that is?
L495892 +++$+++ u7551 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ PROF. ROTH +++$+++ There is, of course, another possible explanation which I dearly hope is not the case.
L495891 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Listen, it's one thing to have a guilt complex. But I know the difference between when I'm overstrung and when I'm seeing things that are simply not there! Besides, it only began after we moved!
L496159 +++$+++ u7547 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ LINDNER +++$+++ How could I fail to notice that! - I have to go...
L496158 +++$+++ u7549 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MRS. LINDNER +++$+++ Hammer?
L496156 +++$+++ u7547 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ LINDNER +++$+++ Yes, something was...
L496155 +++$+++ u7549 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MRS. LINDNER +++$+++ Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?
L496154 +++$+++ u7547 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ LINDNER +++$+++ I think it's starting again. You know... there was something peculiar.  If only I knew...
L495944 +++$+++ u7549 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MRS. LINDNER +++$+++ Well, it will never leave us alone as long as you ignore it.
L495943 +++$+++ u7547 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ LINDNER +++$+++ We should leave the past alone.
L495942 +++$+++ u7549 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MRS. LINDNER +++$+++ You didn't tell her!
L495940 +++$+++ u7549 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MRS. LINDNER +++$+++ Excuse us.  But do stop by for a visit sometime!  You are welcome anytime.
L495939 +++$+++ u7547 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ LINDNER +++$+++ Stop scaring people.  Let's go. We need to be on our way.
L495935 +++$+++ u7549 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MRS. LINDNER +++$+++ Just call me Elisabeth.
L495934 +++$+++ u7547 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ LINDNER +++$+++ Oh, Mrs. Straub.  May I introduce you to my wife?
L495960 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here.
L495959 +++$+++ u7550 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Hey, my man!  How's the masterpiece coming along?
L495738 +++$+++ u7550 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place.  You can afford to spend some money.  If I was you, I'd spare myself all the hard work.  Besides, didn't you want to start writing again?
L495737 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Twenty-three, to be exact.
L495734 +++$+++ u7550 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I guess someone lost their key. You did get your tetanus shots, I hope?
L495733 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Look at this.  The lock is totally demolished.
L495730 +++$+++ u7550 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Very funny.
L495729 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Tenth floor.
L495728 +++$+++ u7550 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Damn, this thing is heavy. Where do you want to have it?
L495717 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Ladies and gentlemen: The "Straub country-residence".
L495716 +++$+++ u7550 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Well, look here!
L499735 +++$+++ u7552 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ ALLEYN +++$+++ He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
L499734 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Oh…what have I done?
L499599 +++$+++ u7552 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ ALLEYN +++$+++ And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
L499598 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You are a gentleman.
L499597 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Thank you, Ned.
L499596 +++$+++ u7552 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ ALLEYN +++$+++ Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
L499595 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Ah
L499594 +++$+++ u7552 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ ALLEYN +++$+++ The title won't do.
L499593 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Oh
L499592 +++$+++ u7552 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ ALLEYN +++$+++ It's good.
L499591 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Ned…I know…I know
L499448 +++$+++ u7552 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ ALLEYN +++$+++ The speech is excellent.  "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible.
L499447 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You did not like the speech?
L499421 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Locked safe in here. I leave the scene in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a sonnet to write.
L499420 +++$+++ u7552 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ ALLEYN +++$+++ Will…Where is Mercutio?
L499373 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Mercutio
L499372 +++$+++ u7552 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ ALLEYN +++$+++ And the title of this piece?
L499371 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona
L499486 +++$+++ u7553 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BOATMAN +++$+++ Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she was this high. Wouldn't deceive a child.
L499485 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Lady?
L499484 +++$+++ u7553 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BOATMAN +++$+++ Thank you, my lady!
L499456 +++$+++ u7553 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BOATMAN +++$+++ Writer, is he?
L499455 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box.
L499282 +++$+++ u7553 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BOATMAN +++$+++ Sir Robert De Lesseps.
L499281 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Do you know that house?
L499280 +++$+++ u7553 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BOATMAN +++$+++ I had the Christopher Marlowe in my boat once.
L499279 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Really?
L499278 +++$+++ u7553 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BOATMAN +++$+++ Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king.
L499277 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yes.
L499276 +++$+++ u7553 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BOATMAN +++$+++ I know your face. Are you an actor?
L499275 +++$+++ u7553 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BOATMAN +++$+++ Right you are, governor!
L499274 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Follow that boat!
L499685 +++$+++ u7554 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BURBAGE +++$+++ Treachery!
L499684 +++$+++ u7558 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ MARLOWE +++$+++ You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
L499683 +++$+++ u7554 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BURBAGE +++$+++ I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo!
L499682 +++$+++ u7558 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ MARLOWE +++$+++ Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.
L499681 +++$+++ u7554 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BURBAGE +++$+++ Never!
L499680 +++$+++ u7558 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ MARLOWE +++$+++ Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
L499679 +++$+++ u7554 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BURBAGE +++$+++ What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
L499678 +++$+++ u7558 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ MARLOWE +++$+++ Twenty pounds on delivery
L499677 +++$+++ u7554 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BURBAGE +++$+++ Wait!  Will you desist!
L499676 +++$+++ u7558 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ MARLOWE +++$+++ Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
L499675 +++$+++ u7554 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BURBAGE +++$+++ Tomorrow.
L499674 +++$+++ u7558 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ MARLOWE +++$+++ You have the money?
L499673 +++$+++ u7554 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BURBAGE +++$+++ You have the last act?
L499672 +++$+++ u7558 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ MARLOWE +++$+++ My Massacre at Paris is complete.
L499671 +++$+++ u7554 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BURBAGE +++$+++ What do you want, Kit?
L499899 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ See you in jail.
L499898 +++$+++ u7554 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BURBAGE +++$+++ We will all be put in the clink.
L499883 +++$+++ u7554 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BURBAGE +++$+++ No Juliet?!
L499882 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ We have no Juliet!
L499132 +++$+++ u7554 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BURBAGE +++$+++ Ask him.
L499131 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
L499130 +++$+++ u7554 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BURBAGE +++$+++ The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
L499129 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.
L499128 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Done.
L499127 +++$+++ u7554 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BURBAGE +++$+++ Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you two more when you show me the pages.
L499126 +++$+++ u7554 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BURBAGE +++$+++ Ned is wrong for it.
L499125 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.
L499124 +++$+++ u7554 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BURBAGE +++$+++ You're a liar.
L499123 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Ten pounds.
L499122 +++$+++ u7554 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BURBAGE +++$+++ How much?
L499121 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
L499120 +++$+++ u7554 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BURBAGE +++$+++ I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
L499119 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Romeo
L499118 +++$+++ u7554 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BURBAGE +++$+++ The title?
L499117 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
L499116 +++$+++ u7554 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BURBAGE +++$+++ What is the chief part?
L499115 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
L499114 +++$+++ u7554 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BURBAGE +++$+++ Are you writing?
L499113 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ When I have fifty pounds.
L499112 +++$+++ u7554 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BURBAGE +++$+++ Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?
L499111 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
L499110 +++$+++ u7554 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ BURBAGE +++$+++ There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?
L499103 +++$+++ u7555 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ DR. MOTH +++$+++ The woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return. Words will flow like a river. I will see you in a week.
L499102 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Will it restore my gift?
L499100 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ yet cannot love nor write it.
L499099 +++$+++ u7555 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ DR. MOTH +++$+++ So now you are free to love
L499098 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
L499097 +++$+++ u7555 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ DR. MOTH +++$+++ No, your marriage bed.
L499096 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ On my mother's side the Ardens
L499095 +++$+++ u7555 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ DR. MOTH +++$+++ And your relations?
L499094 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so
L499093 +++$+++ u7555 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ DR. MOTH +++$+++ A woman of property?
L499090 +++$+++ u7555 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ DR. MOTH +++$+++ No, no. You have a wife, children
L499089 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ A goodly length in times past, but lately
L499088 +++$+++ u7555 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ DR. MOTH +++$+++ How long has it been?
L499087 +++$+++ u7555 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ DR. MOTH +++$+++ Tell me, are you lately humbled in the act of love?
L499086 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
L499085 +++$+++ u7555 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ DR. MOTH +++$+++ Most interesting.
L499084 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Nothing comes.
L499083 +++$+++ u7555 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ DR. MOTH +++$+++ Interesting.
L499082 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
L499081 +++$+++ u7555 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ DR. MOTH +++$+++ I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
L499080 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
L499079 +++$+++ u7555 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ DR. MOTH +++$+++ Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
L499078 +++$+++ u7555 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ DR. MOTH +++$+++ And yet you tell me you lie with women?
L499077 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Words, words, words…once, I had the gift…I could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstones…for sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunnery…but now
L499777 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ And buys a deadly poison. He enters the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who lies there cold as death. He drinks the poison. He dies by her side. And then she wakes and sees him dead.
L499776 +++$+++ u7556 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ FENNYMAN +++$+++ That's me.
L499775 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.
L499723 +++$+++ u7556 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ FENNYMAN +++$+++ By heaven, I thank you! I will be your Apothecary!
L499722 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play. I am writing an Apothecary, a small but vital role.
L499383 +++$+++ u7556 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ FENNYMAN +++$+++ Of course, it was mighty writing. There is no one like Marlowe
L499382 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yes, I saw it.
L499381 +++$+++ u7556 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ FENNYMAN +++$+++ I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.
L499358 +++$+++ u7556 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ FENNYMAN +++$+++ Who is that?
L499357 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.
L499780 +++$+++ u7556 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ FENNYMAN +++$+++ Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.
L499779 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.
L499728 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?
L499727 +++$+++ u7556 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ FENNYMAN +++$+++ Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!
L499706 +++$+++ u7556 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ FENNYMAN +++$+++ Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business
L499705 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business
L499356 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ Yes, but very well.
L499355 +++$+++ u7556 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ FENNYMAN +++$+++ But nothing is happening.
L499354 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ Very well.
L499353 +++$+++ u7556 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ FENNYMAN +++$+++ Is it going well?
L499184 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
L499183 +++$+++ u7556 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ FENNYMAN +++$+++ Where is the play?

L499173 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business.  The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
L499172 +++$+++ u7556 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ FENNYMAN +++$+++ by order of the Master of the Revels!

L499050 +++$+++ u7556 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ FENNYMAN +++$+++ Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's Daughter…Almost finished?
L499048 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ Mr. Fennyman, I think you may have hit on something.
L499047 +++$+++ u7556 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ FENNYMAN +++$+++ Of course not!
L499046 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ There's never any
