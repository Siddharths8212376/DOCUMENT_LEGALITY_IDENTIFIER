L587101 +++$+++ u8267 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ROBERTO +++$+++ Enzo, wake up!
L587026 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Very chic.  Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
L587025 +++$+++ u8267 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ROBERTO +++$+++ What about the shoes?
L586789 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Find the Frenchman.  Find me Mayol.
L586788 +++$+++ u8267 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ROBERTO +++$+++ Yes?
L586787 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ A rosary for Mama, a dress for
L586786 +++$+++ u8267 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ROBERTO +++$+++ Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
L586785 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Then tell him to wax it too.
L586784 +++$+++ u8267 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ROBERTO +++$+++ Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
L586783 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Have the car painted.
L586782 +++$+++ u8267 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ROBERTO +++$+++ Enzo, what are you going to do with the money?
L586733 +++$+++ u8267 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ROBERTO +++$+++ Six seconds.
L586732 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Roberto?  How long?
L587285 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Hey!  D'you have any other complaints?  Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! Okay?
L587284 +++$+++ u8264 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ NOIREUTER +++$+++ Is that alcohol?  Are you out of your mind?  Alcohol is strictly forbidden.
L587281 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Try speaking to me?
L587280 +++$+++ u8264 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ NOIREUTER +++$+++ For others, yes... For you, who knows?
L587279 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ And... does the voice come back?
L587278 +++$+++ u8264 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ NOIREUTER +++$+++ It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
L587277 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ What's with the voice?
L587267 +++$+++ u8264 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ NOIREUTER +++$+++ I didn't say...  Brussels!
L587266 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ And where did you say you were from?
L587265 +++$+++ u8264 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ NOIREUTER +++$+++ Noireuter.
L587264 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ ... What's your name again?
L587263 +++$+++ u8264 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ NOIREUTER +++$+++ The rules are the rules.
L587262 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!
L587261 +++$+++ u8264 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ NOIREUTER +++$+++ You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
L587260 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ It isn't lit yet.
L587259 +++$+++ u8264 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ NOIREUTER +++$+++ Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
L587258 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Plenty of women everywhere right?
L587540 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Jacques, take me back down... Please.
L587539 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ I can't.
L587538 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ ... Push me back in the water...
L587537 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ ... It is much better down there. It's a better place.
L587536 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ ... I was right about what?
L587535 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ You were right.
L587534 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Well that's very nice of you.
L587533 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ No!  I would never cheat you.
L587532 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ You say that because you have the title!
L587531 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport.
L587530 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ We can't dive anymore.  They want to cancel the competition for a while.
L587529 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ I'm concentrating.
L587516 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Long enough to die.  Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
L587515 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ ... How long was I asleep?
L587472 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Enzo, don't be angry.  I was lucky... that's all.
L587471 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ That's good.
L587460 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Thank you, thank you very much!
L587459 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!
L587434 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ It's never the sea!  It's Roberto, Mamma, that stupid actress... Oh shit!  Jacques, what do you know?
L587433 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
L587432 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Anybody can have a bad day!
L587274 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Thank you.
L587273 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
L587272 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ ... Yes.
L587271 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
L587270 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ I don't want to erase anything.
L587269 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ ... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name!  Let me tell you, time erases everything!
L587255 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ So what!?  His job is to hand out the paychecks.  And he does that very well, let me tell you.
L587254 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ He doesn't like us.
L587243 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
L587242 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Can I come in?
L587222 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Oh it's nothing.  I knew it.  I told Roberto "He's very good that little Frenchman, very good".  I lost my title but I won a watch!
L587221 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
L587220 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ You don't have that one, do you?
L587219 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Yes.
L587218 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ You still collect them?
L587216 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Little presents, nothing much... I knew it, I just knew it!  Look here!
L587215 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ What is it?
L587214 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Here...  Here...
L587189 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
L587188 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ What?
L587187 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ You don't need a stretcher to take her with you.  You know that, don't you?
L587186 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Good night.
L587170 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.
L587169 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Hey!  Will you slow down!  When did you learn how to drive?
L587166 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ ... I'm listening.
L587165 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ No, I have to ask you a favor...  You're the only one who'll understand.
L587155 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Because pasta should be eaten "Al Dente".  So the trinket will just have to wait a bit.
L587154 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Tell me, why don't you go and get your medal?
L587082 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Look at me.  These aren't lungs. These are... Tanks.  How long can you hold your breath?
L587081 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
L587080 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ As I said, second of all you're too skinny.  You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
L587079 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Two years younger than you.
L587073 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ If we don't... I'm going to beat you.
L587072 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Why?
L587067 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Well... about everything.
L587066 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Everything about what?
L587065 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ ... Everything.
L587064 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
L587063 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Why?  Are they what's most important?
L587062 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
L587061 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
L587059 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ ... For the mermaids.
L587058 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Why?
L587028 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Then, it's very chic.  Avanti!
L587027 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ No.
L587022 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Get in the car!
L587021 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
L587020 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight.  We have a new world champion.
L587005 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ ... And his friend, Johana...
L587004 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Madame...
L586997 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Ahi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia! Where...?  God, she'll kill me...  ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.
L586996 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Your mother?
L586995 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ What?
L586994 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Enzo?
L586979 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ You're staying at the hotel?
L586978 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Not at all!
L586977 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ No, no!
L586966 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Forget it.  I was joking.
L586965 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ People say that?
L586964 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
L586963 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
L586962 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ So, not married.  Well, good for you.  You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?
L586961 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule!  I was engaged... for a week.  After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls.
L586960 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ No.
L586959 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ ... You married?
L586958 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ It's okay.
L586957 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ How do you make a living?  Your experiments, does it pay well?
L586956 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ That's good.
L586954 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.
L586953 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Well, what are they?
L586952 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.
L586951 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ ... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?
L586941 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Enzo drop it, I'll find something.
L586940 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
L586939 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else.
L586938 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ You don't have a room?  Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
L586937 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ I don't have one.
L586936 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ What room have you got?
L586935 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ I remember.  Hi Roberto!
L586890 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ That's too easy!  Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me:  "D'you know that French guy, Mayol?  He's supposed to be very good!  Too bad he doesn't compete." So, you're going to come with me to Taormina! First, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure.  ... I'll see you there...
L586889 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ You're the best, Enzo!
L586888 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ No.  All you need is to want to be the best.
L586887 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
L586886 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
L586885 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Why?
L586882 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ They say I'm like Lazarus.  You know, the guy who was raised from the dead?!
L586881 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Great!
L586880 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ I dove 315 feet!
L586879 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Yes, I know.
L586878 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ That's good.  You never would have recognized me, huh?  Check out the suit! Looking good, no?  You know I'm the world champion?
L586875 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Enzo...
L586874 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Jacques, my friend, how are you?
L586728 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ If you did mind, you'd tell me, wouldn't you?
L586727 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ No...
L586726 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ You don't mind if I go instead, do you?
L586725 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Fine!
L586724 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman!  How is the little Frenchman?
L586806 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ The guy in the Halloween suit!
L586805 +++$+++ u8260 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Who?
L586804 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
L586801 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ ... both.  Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
L586800 +++$+++ u8260 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Tea... or whiskey?
L586799 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
L586798 +++$+++ u8260 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ A drink to warm up?
L586796 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Does anybody live to make a second?
L586795 +++$+++ u8260 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
L586794 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Don't you have a heater?
L587564 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Promise you won't forget me.
L587563 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Anything.
L587562 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Promise me one thing.
L587560 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ You are the father.
L587559 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
L587558 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Jacques?  I'm pregnant.
L587554 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ I saw how it has to be.
L587553 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ You've got to tell me what happened?
L587523 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
L587522 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Why?
L587521 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ ... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
L587520 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ ... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
L587487 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ No, I'll be fine.  Can you just hand me a glass of water?
L587486 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ You want to lie down for a while?
L587485 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
L587484 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ What's wrong?
L587475 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ You go back, I'll walk.
L587474 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Jacques...?
L587467 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ I'm putting you on the coin... Your essence... That way you'll always be with me when I dive.
L587466 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ What are you doing?
L587443 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ ... Nothing.
L587442 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ What?
L587440 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ I don't know... it didn't feel right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired.
L587439 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ You'll try again tomorrow?
L587438 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ I didn't dive.

L587349 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
L587344 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Okay.  In that case... I'm at the airport in Nice.

L587337 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there...  and you decide that you will die for them... Only then do they start coming out.  They come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... If it's sincere.  If it's pure... They will be with you and take you away forever.
L587336 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ No... tell me.
L587335 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Do you know how it is?  Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
L587334 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Uh... Ah!  A story?
