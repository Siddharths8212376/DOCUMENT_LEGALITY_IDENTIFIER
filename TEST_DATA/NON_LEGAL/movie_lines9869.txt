L250354 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Let me tell you what I do know. Every day I come by to pick you up, and we go out drinkin' or whatever and we have a few laughs. But you know what the best part of my day is? The ten seconds before I knock on the door 'cause I let myself think I might get there, and you'd be gone. I'd knock on the door and you wouldn't be there. You just left.
L250353 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You don't know that.
L250352 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.
L250351 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
L250350 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
L250349 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
L250348 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
L250347 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
L250346 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ It's a way outta here.
L250345 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
L250344 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
L250343 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
L250342 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Are they hookin' you up with a job?
L250341 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Week after I'm twenty-one.
L250340 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal pussy.  So, when are you done with those meetin's?
L250337 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Some shows are worth the price of admission, partner.
L250336 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes.
L250335 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Sorry, brother.  I don't know what to tell ya. You know all the girls I been with. You been with 'em too, except for Cheryl McGovern which was a big mistake on your part brother...
L250334 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ She went to Medical school in California.
L250333 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ What?
L250332 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Gone.
L250331 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ How's the woman?
L250067 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.
L250066 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Thanks, Chuck.
L250063 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I was countin' on it.
L250062 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ What do I look like, Al Cowlins?  You want to take my car, drop her off?
L250061 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I don't know what the fuck you're doin'. You're givin' us a ride.
L249939 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ I don't know.
L249938 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Why not?
L249937 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ I didn't get on Cathy last night.
L249921 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No one. I didn't have the number.
L249920 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Who'd you call?
L249678 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ You're fuckin' good.
L249677 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Probation, counselin', few days a week.
L249676 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ What'd you get? You get leniency?
L249552 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Next week.
L249551 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ When's the arraignment?
L249546 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yeah, you're all invited over to Morgan's house for a complementary fish sandwhich.
L249545 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Hey, thanks for comin' out.
L249537 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I don't know yet.
L249536 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ What do we got?
L249531 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ No, and we got four of 'em.
L249530 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish?
L249527 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Jesus Christ. Not even close.
L249526 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ She didn't do it again did she?
L249512 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ We're not goin'.  I don't even like "Kelly's."
L249511 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ She's sharp as a marble.
L249487 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Fuck you.
L249486 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids.  You'd prob'ly fit right in.
L249485 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What are we gonna do up there?
L249484 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. We should go there sometime.
L249483 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Stop crowdin the plate!
L249482 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Stop brushin' me back!
L249473 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ --or a tail--
L249472 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Yeah, so he's like "Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"--
L249457 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Okay. He's driving along and this fuckin' cat jumps in front of his car, and so he hits this cat--
L249456 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Chuckie, what the fuck happened?
L250207 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Yeah, it is.
L250206 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Is that true?
L250203 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ I really don't know what to say. Look, I lie to women all the time. That's just my way.  Last week Morgan brought these girls down from Roslindale. I told them I was a cosmonaut. They believed me. But Will's not usually like that--
L250202 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me.
L250201 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Well, I don't have no trousers on...
L250200 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
L250199 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ You caught that, huh?
L250198 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ See, now this doesn't feel right.  When I made the decision to come over here it felt right. I had all these rationalizations... I just don't understand why Will never tells me anything, he won't let me get close to him, he tells me these weird lies--
L250197 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Let's take a walk. EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY
L250196 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Okay.
L250195 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
L250194 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Is this a bad time?
L250193 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
L250192 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ I guess so.
L250189 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ This is your house, right?
L250188 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Oh, right.
L250187 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
L250186 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ How'd you know where to find me?
L250185 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Good.
L250184 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ How you doin'?
L250183 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Hi.
L250072 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ I wanted to meet your brothers...
L250071 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Yeah, not tonight. Not any other night. He knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.
L250060 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ See ya' Chuckie. I had fun.
L250059 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ I'm glad you came by, changed my opinion of Harvard people.
L249585 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Yah, it's not a bad school...
L249584 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Oh...
L249583 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Ah, history I think.
L249582 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ What class?
L249579 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ So, you ladies ah, go to school here?
L249578 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Okay.
L250447 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Guy's been up my ass for two years about a fuckin' job. I had to let him help with the car.
L250446 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
L250445 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Me and Bill scraped together the parts, worked on it. Morgan was out panhandlin' every day.
L250437 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in.
L250436 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.
L250435 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Shut the fuck up.
L250434 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ What'd you say about me?
L250428 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Oh, Morgan.
L250427 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
L250426 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Oh my God, I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you.
L250282 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ I don't have a VCR at my house.
L250281 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Why don't you beat off at your house?
L250280 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ What's up guys?
L250065 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.
L250064 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ Chuck, let's go.
L250058 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ I'm Irish.
L250057 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ It's a good thing no one's Irish here.
L250055 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.
L250054 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ Did your Uncle get arrested?
L250051 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ So in the morning, there's a knock on the door it's the Statie. So my Uncle's like, "Is there a problem?" And the Statie's like "I pulled you over and you took off." And my Uncle's like "I never seen you before in my life, I been home all night with my kids." And Statie's like "Let me get in your garage!" So he's like "All right, fine." He takes around the garage and opens the door --and the Statie's cruiser is in my Uncle's garage.
L250050 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ Holy shit.
L250049 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Yeah, he was probably drunker than my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the cop goes "Stay here" And he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. So, my Uncle Marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck it." He gets in his car and drives home.
L250048 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ Some other guy?
L249572 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ I told you "no" yesterday!
L249571 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
L249570 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
L249565 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ Yah, that was different. Management was restructurin'--
L249564 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ You got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch.
L249542 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ I'm serious Chuckie, I ain't goin'.
L249541 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Morgan, Let's go.
L249540 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ No, why didn't you fight him at the park if you wanted to? I'm not goin' now, I'm eatin' my snack. WILL  So don't go.
L249539 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Shut up.
L249538 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ Come on, Will...
L249529 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!! IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!
L249528 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ Did she get my Double Burger?
L249525 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ I think you should establish a good line of credit.
L249524 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?
L249523 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
L249522 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ I told you, I just got change.
L249521 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ How much money you got?
L249520 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ Yah, all right...
L249519 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
L249518 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ So why don't you give me my sandwhich?
L249517 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Would you shut the fuck up! I know what you ordered, I was there!
L249510 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ She's not stupid.
L249509 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell you why we're not going to "Kelly's." It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once.
L249508 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Morgan, I'm not goin' to "Kelly's Roast Beef" just cause you like the take-out girl. It's fifteen minutes out of our way. MORGAN What else we gonna do we can't spare fifteen minutes?
L249505 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ Fuck her.
L249504 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
L249503 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ Fuck this, let's get something to eat...
L249497 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ You could put a pool in that backyard.
L249496 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ Yah, that is a nice ass.
L249475 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ And so they go around to the front of his truck...and there's another cat on the grille.
L249474 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ WILL!
L249468 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ And all the time he's apologizin' to the cat, goin' "I'm sorry." BANG, "I'm sorry." BANG!
L249467 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ Jesus.
L249459 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ --and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!" And he looks in his rearview and sees this cat-- I'm sorry--
L249458 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ --That isn't funny--
L250150 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Come now...what do you think I am, a juvinile? You don't got any money on you right now. You think I'm gonna take a check? EXECUTIVE It's fine, John, I can cover the rest.
L250149 +++$+++ u5609 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ EXECUTIVE +++$+++ Will you take a check?
L250148 +++$+++ u5609 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ EXECUTIVE +++$+++ I have about seventy-three...
L250147 +++$+++ u5609 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ EXECUTIVE +++$+++ I don't think I...Larry?
L250146 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Allegedly, what I am saying is your situation will be concurrently improved if I had two hundred sheets in my pocket right now.
L250145 +++$+++ u5609 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ EXECUTIVE +++$+++ You want us to give you cash right now?
L250144 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Retainer...
L250143 +++$+++ u5609 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ EXECUTIVE +++$+++ Will, our offer starts you at eighty- four thousand a year, plus benefits.
L250140 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ --These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated.
L250139 +++$+++ u5609 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ EXECUTIVE +++$+++ I'm not sure--
L249596 +++$+++ u5607 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ There's no problem. I was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies. My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian pre- capitalist and...
L249595 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ All right, are we gonna have a problem?
L249594 +++$+++ u5607 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.
L249593 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.
L249592 +++$+++ u5607 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.
L249591 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time.
L249590 +++$+++ u5607 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ History? Just "history?" It must have been a survey course then.
L249589 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ Good, it was all right.
L249588 +++$+++ u5607 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ How'd you like that course?
L249587 +++$+++ u5606 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CHUCKIE +++$+++ History.
L249586 +++$+++ u5607 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ What class did you say that was?
L250278 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Why shouldn't I work for the National Security Agency? That's a tough one.
L250277 +++$+++ u5608 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ DYTRESS +++$+++ That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't "why should you work for N.S.A." it's "why shouldn't you?"
L250276 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.
L250275 +++$+++ u5608 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ DYTRESS +++$+++ That's one aspect of what we do.
L250274 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Codebreaking.
L250273 +++$+++ u5608 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ DYTRESS +++$+++ Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms--
L250272 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency?
L249740 +++$+++ u5610 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ HYPNOTIST +++$+++ You don't have to be nervous, Will.
L249739 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Down there.  And I'm nervous.
L249738 +++$+++ u5610 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ HYPNOTIST +++$+++ Where is it touching you?
L249737 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ It's touching me.
L249736 +++$+++ u5610 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ HYPNOTIST +++$+++ You're in a safe place, Will.
L249735 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer.
L249734 +++$+++ u5610 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ HYPNOTIST +++$+++ What is it?
L249733 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Somethin's in my room.
L249732 +++$+++ u5610 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ HYPNOTIST +++$+++ And what do you see?
L249731 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Seven.
L249730 +++$+++ u5610 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ HYPNOTIST +++$+++ Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you?
L250022 +++$+++ u5613 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ PEKEC +++$+++ --But--
L250021 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ --Maker builds "K" to the "N." N is three to the K times--
L250018 +++$+++ u5613 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ PEKEC +++$+++ The limit is not found!  The limit is not found.
L250017 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ No, there's a limit.
L250016 +++$+++ u5613 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ PEKEC +++$+++ Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!
L250015 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ --But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--
L250014 +++$+++ u5613 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ PEKEC +++$+++ With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--
L250013 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing...
L249639 +++$+++ u5618 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Well, he didn't show up for work today...
L249638 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
L249637 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
L249636 +++$+++ u5618 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Well, if something was stolen, I should know about it.
L249635 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Building two.
L249634 +++$+++ u5618 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Which one's your building?
L249633 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--
