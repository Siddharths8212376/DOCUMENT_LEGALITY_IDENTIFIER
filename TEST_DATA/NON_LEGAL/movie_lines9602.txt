L83474 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
L83473 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ She was only-
L83472 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Leave off..

L83465 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't want to know.
L83464 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ I said I had two things to say to you. I only told you one. I have to tell you the other.
L83463 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ There was a rooster named Mister down at Sweet Home. Last time I saw Halle, with that butter all over his face and me with an iron bit in my mouth, I saw Mister - sitting on a tub. He loved that tub. Like king on a throne. He was a hateful thing. Bloody and evil..But he was better than me.  Mister was allowed to be and stay what he was. Even if you cooked him you'd be cooking a rooster named Mister. But wasn't no way I'd ever be Paul D. again..Schoolteacher changed me. Was never no beating under Mr. Garner. Schoolteacher changed that. Why wouldn't a man run from that? Why wouldn't a man not work, kill, starve, pull out his own heart to stop feeling 'stead of feeling that? And it strikes me, it's got to be cause we were something else. And that something was less than a chicken sitting in the sun on a tub.
L83462 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ I don't believe that. I won't.
L83461 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
L83460 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
L83459 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free?
L83458 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ No use thinking these things now.
L83457 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
L83456 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ Never found out.
L83455 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You remember your price, Stamp?
L83446 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Oh yeah. I got big plans.
L83445 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ You planning to do anything about it?
L83444 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Just me.
L83443 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.
L83442 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
L83441 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.
L83440 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ For what?
L83439 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
L83438 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
L83437 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
L83645 +++$+++ u4045 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ SETHE +++$+++ She was my best thing.
L83644 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
L83643 +++$+++ u4045 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ SETHE +++$+++ She left me. She's gone again.
L83642 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What, baby?

L83639 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!?
L83638 +++$+++ u4045 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ SETHE +++$+++ I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.

L85180 +++$+++ u4049 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ BLOND MAN +++$+++ And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
L85179 +++$+++ u4066 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WOO +++$+++ Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie Treehorn wants to see you.
L84448 +++$+++ u4066 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WOO +++$+++ He looks like a fuckin' loser.
L84447 +++$+++ u4049 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ BLOND MAN +++$+++ What do you think?
L84446 +++$+++ u4066 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WOO +++$+++ Fuck.
L84445 +++$+++ u4066 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WOO +++$+++ Uh?
L84444 +++$+++ u4049 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ BLOND MAN +++$+++ Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?
L84443 +++$+++ u4066 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WOO +++$+++ Yeah?
L85345 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ But I guess she told Dieter.
L85344 +++$+++ u4050 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ BRANDT +++$+++ Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
L85343 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ Where'd she been?
L84946 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ Well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for.  Speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax--
L84945 +++$+++ u4050 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ BRANDT +++$+++ That had not occurred to us, Dude.
L84936 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ No, man, nothing is fucked here--
L84935 +++$+++ u4050 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ BRANDT +++$+++ This is our concern, Dude.
L84731 +++$+++ u4050 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ BRANDT +++$+++ Her life is in your hands, Dude. And report back to us as soon as it's done.
L84730 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ Shit.
L84729 +++$+++ u4050 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ BRANDT +++$+++ Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
L84728 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ Oh, man, don't say that..
L84727 +++$+++ u4050 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ BRANDT +++$+++ Her life is in your hands.
L84726 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L84725 +++$+++ u4050 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ BRANDT +++$+++ Here's the money, and the phone. Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give.
L84724 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ Oh, nothin', you know.
L84723 +++$+++ u4050 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ BRANDT +++$+++ They called about eighty minutes ago.  They want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. One person only or I'd go with you. They were very clear on that: one person only.  What happened to your jaw?
L84673 +++$+++ u4050 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ BRANDT +++$+++ Well Dude, we just don't know.
L84672 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
L84671 +++$+++ u4050 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ BRANDT +++$+++ He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion.
L84670 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ Why me, man?
L84669 +++$+++ u4050 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ BRANDT +++$+++ Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
