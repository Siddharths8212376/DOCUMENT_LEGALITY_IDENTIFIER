L465988 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
L465987 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ What happened?
L465521 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ I'm going to die! I need a doctor! I'm begging you, take me to a doctor.
L465520 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Lie back down, and try to -
L465519 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
L465518 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ I can' take you to a hospital.
L465517 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
L465516 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ It's not good...
L465515 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
L465514 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ You're not gonna fucking die, all right?
L465513 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't give a fuck about jail, I just don't wanna die.
L465511 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
L465510 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
L465508 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Bet your sweet ass we are.
L465507 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ Joe.
L465506 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on, and wait for Joe. I can't do anything for you, but when Joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he'll be able to help you. We're just gonna sit here, and wait for Joe. Who are we waiting for?
L465505 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Correct.
L465504 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ I'm okay.
L465503 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna be okay!
L465501 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ No, I'm not!
L465500 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
L465499 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
L465498 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Hey, just cancel that shit right now! You're hurt. You're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.
L465471 +++$+++ u2619 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ NICE GUY EDDIE +++$+++ Ahh, now we're getting down to it. It's not just that he's a cheap bastard -
L465470 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ These ladies aren't starvin' to death. They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.
L465466 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
L465465 +++$+++ u2619 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ NICE GUY EDDIE +++$+++ I'd go over twelve percent for that.
L465461 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin' their job.
L465460 +++$+++ u2619 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ NICE GUY EDDIE +++$+++ I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
L465456 +++$+++ u2619 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ NICE GUY EDDIE +++$+++ You don't believe in tipping?
L465455 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ I don't believe in it.
L465454 +++$+++ u2619 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ NICE GUY EDDIE +++$+++ Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
L465453 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Uh-uh. I don't tip.
L465452 +++$+++ u2619 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ NICE GUY EDDIE +++$+++ C'mon, throw in a buck.
L465436 +++$+++ u2619 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ NICE GUY EDDIE +++$+++ When I was coming down here, I was playin' it. And "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on. Now I ain't heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, I heard it a million-trillion times. I'm listening to it this morning, and this was the first time I ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed Andy.
L465435 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
L465434 +++$+++ u2619 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ NICE GUY EDDIE +++$+++ Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
L465433 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
L465432 +++$+++ u2619 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ NICE GUY EDDIE +++$+++ Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?
L465962 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr. White. You gotta cool-sounding name. So tell me, Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink" is no big deal, you wanna trade?
L465961 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Who cares what your name is? Who cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...
L465930 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Yeah, those guys too.
L465929 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Not these guys.
L465928 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
L465927 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
L465924 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ There's a slight difference.
L465923 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ ...Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about, black women ain't the same as white women.
L465812 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ This is what he was doin'.
L465811 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store.
L465792 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ What are you gonna do about him?
L465791 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ I told ya he'd be pissed.
L465693 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Fuck sides! What we need is a little solidarity here. Somebody's stickin' a red hot poker up our asses and we gotta find out whose hand's on the handle. Now I know I'm no piece of shit...  And I'm pretty sure you're a good boy...  And I'm fuckin positive you're on the level. So let's figure out who's the bad guy.
L465692 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ You takin' his side?
L465691 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
L465690 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
L465689 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
L465688 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ So you wanna git bit, huh?
L465687 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down!
L465673 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ This place just ain't secure anymore. We're leaving, and you should go with us.
L465672 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ We don't think this place is safe.
L465671 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Is that supposed to be funny?
L465666 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Enough! You better start talkin' to us, asshole, cause we got shit we need to talk about. We're already freaked out, we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.
L465665 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ He got it in the belly. He's still alive, but won't be for long.
L465655 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Fuck you, White! I didn't create this situation, I'm just dealin' with it. You're acting like a first- year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a professional. They get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen. And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault. I didn't tell him my name. I didn't tell him where I was from. I didn't tell him what I knew better than to tell him. Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name. You, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created. So if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.
L465654 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ You wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit? Take a shot!
L465651 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ That fuckin did it!
L465650 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
L465649 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ If we don't, he'll die.
L465648 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ We ain't taking him to a hospital.
L465647 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ If I have to tell you again to back off, me an you are gonna go round and round.
L465646 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
L465645 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Of course.
L465644 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
L465643 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Don't fuckin' patronize me.
L465642 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
L465641 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ We had just gotten away from the cops. He just got shot. It was my fuckin' fault he got shot. He's a fuckin' bloody mess - he's screaming. I swear to god, I thought we was gonna die right then and there. I'm tryin' to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm gonna take care of him. And he asked me what my name was. I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms. What the fuck was I supposed to tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out that information, it's against the rules. I don't trust you enough."? Maybe I shoulda, but I couldn't.
L465640 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ He asked.
L465639 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
L465638 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
L465637 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Why!
L465636 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ I told him my first name, and where I'm from.
L465635 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
L465634 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Well, he knows a little about me.
L465633 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
L465632 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ I don't know anybody.
L465631 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.
L465630 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here.
L465629 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians... Jesus Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. If I was him, I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.
L465628 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Joe could help him. If we can get in touch with Joe, Joe could get him to a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to come and see him.
L465627 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ You gotta idea, spit it out.
L465626 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
L465625 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.
L465624 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
L465623 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ We can't take him to a hospital.
L465622 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ He will be dead fer sure, if we don't get him to a hospital.
L465621 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ He scared the fuckin' shit outta me. I thought he was dead fer sure.
L465620 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ I think he's just passed out.
L465619 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ So what is it?
L465618 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ He ain't dead.
L465617 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ So, is he dead or what?
L465597 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
L465596 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
L465595 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Look, asshole, I'm right! Somebody's a fuckin' rat. How many times do I hafta say it before it sinks in your skull?
L465594 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
L465593 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
L465592 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ For all I know, you're the rat.
L465591 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.
L465590 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
L465589 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.
L465588 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
L465587 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ No shit?
L465586 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
L465585 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ What?
L465584 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.
L465583 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute.
L465582 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ That was the plan, we meet here.
L465581 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
L465580 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Where? Are they out in the car?
L465579 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ I got 'em, all right?
L465578 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Where?
L465577 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ I got the diamonds.
L465576 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ How can you be so sure?
L465575 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Nope.
L465574 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
L465573 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
L465572 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
L465571 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
L465570 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ What do you think?
L465569 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.
L465568 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.
L465567 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
L465566 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
L465565 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
L465564 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
L465563 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
L465562 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
L465561 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
L465560 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Uh-uh, just cops.
L465559 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ No real people?
L465558 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ A few cops.
L465557 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?
L465554 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Shot my way out. Everybody was shooting, so I just blasted my way outta there.
L465553 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ You're right, this is bad.  How did you get out?
L465552 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
L465551 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit -
L465550 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off. I'm not sayin' they weren't there, I'm sayin' they were there. But they didn't move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman. That's how I know we were set up. You can see that, can't you, Mr. White?
L465549 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.
L465548 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
L465547 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ What's wrong with it?
L465546 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ That's not correct.
L465545 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Okay, let's go through what happened. We're in the place, everything's going fine. Then the alarm gets tripped. I turn around and all these cops are outside. You're right, it was like, bam! I blink my eyes are they're there. Everybody starts going apeshit. Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin' all the -
L465544 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Why not?
L465543 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Want a smoke?
L465541 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
L465540 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ I'm cool.
L465539 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ What's done is done, I need you cool. Are you cool?
L465538 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ What the fuck am I doing here? I felt funny about this job right off. As soon as I felt it I should said "No thank you", and walked. But I never fucking listen. Every time I ever got burned buying weed, I always knew the guy wasn't right. I just felt it. But I wanted to believe him. If he's not lyin' to me, and it really is Thai stick, then whoa baby. But it's never Thai stick. And I always said if I felt that way about a job, I'd walk. And I did, and I didn't, because of fuckin' money!
L465537 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Let's go in the other room...
L465536 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
L465535 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him.
L465534 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?
L465533 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ You really think we were set up?
L465532 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
L465531 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ As opposed to good?
L465530 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
L465529 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
L465528 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
L465527 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Dead.
L465526 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
L465525 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Gun shot.
L465482 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Fuck all that.
L465481 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country. It's the one job basically any woman can get, and make a living on. The reason is because of tips.
L465477 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ So's working at McDonald's, but you don't feel the need to tip them. They're servin' ya food, you should tip em. But no, society says tip these guys over here, but not those guys over there. That's bullshit.
L465476 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.
L465475 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Do you know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses.
L474666 +++$+++ u2625 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ GARDNER +++$+++ Yeah. Keep a closer eye on her --  And him. Shootin' going on, we'll never find Lednov.
L474665 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Look of things, she doesn't.
L474664 +++$+++ u2625 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ GARDNER +++$+++ All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.
L474663 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
L474662 +++$+++ u2625 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ GARDNER +++$+++ What's she doin' runnin' around the country at night.
L474660 +++$+++ u2625 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ GARDNER +++$+++ Nobody. The light was bad.
L474659 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Who shot who?
L474426 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
L474425 +++$+++ u2625 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ GARDNER +++$+++ And that's more important than finding Lednov?
L474424 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
L474423 +++$+++ u2625 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ GARDNER +++$+++ We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
L474422 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Maybe he did.
L474421 +++$+++ u2625 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ GARDNER +++$+++ You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
L474412 +++$+++ u2625 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ GARDNER +++$+++ Graham's got something to tell you might interest you.
L474411 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner.
L474769 +++$+++ u2631 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MRS. WYATT +++$+++ Why didn't you say so. Go right out and get her. Ed. build the fire up.
L474768 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ And one of 'em is sick.
L474767 +++$+++ u2631 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MRS. WYATT +++$+++ It doesn't matter who they are.
L474766 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
L474765 +++$+++ u2631 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MRS. WYATT +++$+++ Tell them to come on in.
L474763 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
L474762 +++$+++ u2631 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MRS. WYATT +++$+++ You don't know how good it is to see you.
L475232 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I haven't got the job yet.
L475231 +++$+++ u2621 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
L475230 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Why?
