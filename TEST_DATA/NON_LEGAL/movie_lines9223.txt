L348594 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.
L348593 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Crop duster.
L348592 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
L348591 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I don't see you coming up with any plans.
L348590 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.
L348589 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it.
L348588 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.
L348587 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ One of the new kids said they're farming those acres just north of the swamp. He said he saw a crop duster flying around the place.
L348584 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Make 'em throw strikes.
L348583 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ You show them Crawfords how to play ball.
L348578 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.
L348577 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Let it go, Claude.
L348571 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Let me see that.
L348570 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ It's a pardon from the governor.
L348534 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Whatever.
L348533 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Crawfords.
L348532 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
L348531 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it.
L348519 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
L348518 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ What about us? Don't forget to mention us.
L348516 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ So, Blocker, what do you think of our boy?
L348515 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ It's amazing what Ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses.
L348485 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the mound. All I know is when this season's over Camp 8's gonna have pork chops.
L348484 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Judge must have money riding on the championship.
L348478 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
L348477 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
L348476 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Him?
L348475 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You want to hit?  Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot.
L348473 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ I'm sick of watching Camp 12 win the championship. Every year they get to roast the victory pig and we get dick. This year I want that pig.
L348472 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What you're dealing with here is a complete lack of talent.
L348457 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Of course, he's in the lineup. There he goes right there. Hey, Babe...!
L348456 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
L348455 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
L348454 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ What am I gonna eat?
L348453 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself.
L348452 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ I can't eat it with mustard.
L348451 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
L348450 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ You get ketchup?
L348449 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
L348448 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ I know people.
L348447 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
L348446 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
L348445 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I don't know. Who do you want?
L348444 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
L348443 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers are playing a double-header against the Red Sox.
L348442 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Hundred and Sixty First Street? That's Yankee Stadium.
L348441 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ We're in the Bronx, my man. Hundred and Sixty First Street.
L348440 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ The hell you talking about? What train?
L348439 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.
L348438 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Say what?
L348437 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ We'll just get off at the next stop.
L348436 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ How the fuck are we gonna do that, Ray?!
L348435 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ All right, man, just settle down. We'll get outta here, Claude. We'll get outta here real soon.
L348434 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!
L348433 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.
L348414 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ I'm serious, man. Don't mention it. Ever.
L348413 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
L348412 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Don't mention it.
L348399 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'm stuck!
L348398 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Come on, Ray, time to go!
L348396 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ That gripes my soul, man. We're out here in the middle of nowhere. There is shit nibbling at my balls! Don't tell me you don't know where we're going!
L348395 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't have a map.
L348394 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ You drew this?!
L348393 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
L348392 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
L348391 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Let me take a look at that map.
L348390 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Absolutely. The map is very clear.
L348389 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ I know these trees all look the same, but I'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. You sure you know where we're going?
L348388 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?
L348387 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!
L348379 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Don't call me that. You know I hate it when you call me that.
L348378 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I said you're soft.
L348377 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ What'd you say?
L348376 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.
L348375 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Does that mean I'm in?
L348374 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.
L348373 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ No.
L348372 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me?
L348371 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
L348370 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard.
L348369 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
L348368 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ On your behalf. What happened to we?
L348367 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Look, my cousin Maynard is a lawyer. He filed an appeal on my behalf --
L348366 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
L348365 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.
L348364 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Yeah.
L348363 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ You still got that map?
L348362 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
L348361 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --
L348360 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet.
L348359 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
L348358 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What do you want, Claude?
L348357 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
L348356 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Claude.
L348355 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ What's up, Ray?
L348354 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'm sure it don't.
L348353 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
L348352 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.
L348312 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Getting a map from a chubby chef named Cookie? Dragging our asses through the swamps in search of some worm-eaten boat? That ain't a plan, that's a vacation for two in the hole. When you've got a map to New York City, you get back to me.
L348311 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'm not gonna forget it. What does that mean? If you've got a plan, I think I have a right to know about it. I told you my plan.
L348310 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Forget it.
L348309 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What does that mean?
L348308 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ No, I don't like it here. Look around. There's nothing but ass. Male ass! Balls and ass! Believe you me, I'm getting out of here.
L348307 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You want out of this place, don't you? Don't tell me you're starting to like it here.
L348306 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Why are you always talking about we? There is no we. There is a me, there is a you. But there is no we between us.
L348305 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What I know about boats is they take you to freedom. Come on, man. I think we can do this.
L348304 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim.
L348303 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
L348302 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
L348301 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You know what I'm saying.
L348300 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ So?
L348299 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Cookie drew me a map to Greenville.
L348220 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
L348219 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ No, man. I want you to have it.
L348205 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ He just blocked it out. Nigger's crazy. He's the one who did all the stabbing. He's capable of some heinous shit.  How 'bout him down there?
L348204 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
L348203 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...
L348192 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What about you, Radio?
L348191 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ What a second, you've been in here since you were thirteen?
L348184 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.
L348183 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ This fork is filthy.
L348173 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ He does it all by himself.
L348172 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ So?
L348171 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
L348170 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
L348126 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do you know, anyway?
L348125 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I wouldn't do that if I was you.
L348114 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!
L348113 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!
L348094 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ If it wasn't for me, you'd be washing up on the beach at Coney Island right now.  "I need all my thumbs and fingers for praying and doing good."
L348093 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
L348092 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Man, this is gonna delay everything. Spanky's gonna be pissed.
L348089 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Hell with him then. If he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck.
L348088 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Would you look at that, Ray. Winston up and died on us.
L348086 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Come on, Ray, better get Winston back to the truck.
L348085 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Winston. His name's Winston.
L348084 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Yeah, nobody puts 'em away like old what's-his-name.
L348080 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ My daddy's watch. This is the dude I was telling you about --
L348079 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ What ain't there?
L348078 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ It ain't here.
L348077 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ What do you think you're doing?! The man's been dead for two seconds! Don't you have any respect?
L348076 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Oh, man, I've never seen a dead body before!
L348075 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ He's dead.
L348074 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ I think he's hurt pretty bad.
L348071 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money.
L348070 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
L348069 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ He even got my daddy's watch.
L348068 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ You lost all our money in a card game?
L348067 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes.
L348066 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L348065 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
L348064 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
L348063 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ So you made a generous contribution.
L348062 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...
L348061 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That jelly you were talking to right here?
L348060 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
L348059 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Still got that ten dollars?
L348058 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Guess we better get going, huh?
L348057 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Here I am.
L348056 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.
L348023 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ There are people down there having fun. I want to be one of them. I want you to be one of them. On Monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and a fistful of cash.
L348022 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Reward?
L348021 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.
L348020 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
L348019 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Don't get all agitated on me. I bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes, I heard 'em talking...
L348018 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Oh, I don't know, maybe because our lives depend on it, I just sort of thought you knew what you were doing!
L348017 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What gave you that idea?
L348016 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you?
L348003 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Okay then, I'm gonna walk over to that counter and get us some fucking pie.
L348002 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Yeah, I want some pie.
L348001 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Alright. You want some pie?
L348000 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I call it like I see it, and what I see is definitely soft.
L347999 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
L347998 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I said you're soft.
L347997 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ What'd you say?
L347996 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You're soft.
L347995 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
L347994 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.
L347990 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way.
L347989 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ You mean this sign? The one that says "No Coloreds Allowed." That's a good question. Ray, how come we missed the sign?
L347983 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ I must have left my appetite outside, which is where I think we ought to be right now.
L347982 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
L347981 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Maybe we oughta find another place.
L347979 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I think I liked you better when you kept your trap shut.
L347978 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Oooh...
L347977 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ When there is, you can forget about it. And I swear to God, you ever talk about my daddy again I'm gonna kick your bank-telling, loan-denying ass, you got me?
L347976 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ There is no Boom-Boom Room.
L347975 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Ah, go chase yourself. I'll take my business elsewhere. And for future reference, you are no longer welcome at Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
L347974 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!
L347973 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
L347972 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
L347971 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ My daddy gave me this watch.
L347970 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
L347969 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Like this?
L347968 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ You need collateral.
L347967 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ How would I get a loan, anyway?
L347966 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L347965 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?
L347964 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ That's right, a loan officer.
L347963 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ A loan officer?
