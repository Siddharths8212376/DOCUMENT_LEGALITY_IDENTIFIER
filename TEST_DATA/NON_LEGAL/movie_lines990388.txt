L575237 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
L575236 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L575235 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Same.
L575234 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Not much -- you?
L575233 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What d'you say, Elaine?
L575275 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
L575274 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
L575270 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Poor baby.
L575269 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...
L575268 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Friends and <u>colleagues</u>.
L575231 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Bloke told me.
L575230 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ How do you know?
L575229 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ That's where Valentine's scarpered.
L575228 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What's in Big Sur?
L575227 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.
L575226 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
L575225 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Fancy it?
L575224 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
L575223 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ How far?
L575222 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Up the coast.
L575221 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Where's Big Sur?
L575172 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ I know that.  But as time went on ... well, it <u>wasn't</u> a joke, was it?  She had a feeling about it -- about the last job -- how long I'd get the hook for.  Said she wouldn't be there this time when I got out.
L575171 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
L575170 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ She used to tell me she'd turn me in.  Little kid.  Ten year old.  "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke.
L575169 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
L575168 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
L575167 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
L575166 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up --  in increments.
L575164 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ I fiddle it.  They got me down as an immigrant with five kids.
L575163 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
L575162 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.
L575158 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?
L575157 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Minor officials bother you, don't they?
L575156 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.
L575155 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Won't he be looking for you about now?
L575154 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ You sound like my fucking probation officer.
L575153 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I guess you're just habitual.
L575152 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Black market during the war.
L575151 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What'd your father do?
L575150 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.
L575149 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ He alive to see this?
L575148 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.
L575147 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What about your grandmother?
L575146 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Not that I recall.
L575145 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Stick with me, kid.  Looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes.
L575144 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
L575143 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
L575142 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ I've 'ardly ever left it.
L575141 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Only in the movies.
L575140 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ You ever been to London?
L575139 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ -- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck.  One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.
L575095 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Pushing the legal limit even then.
L575094 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
L575093 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I don't believe it.
L575092 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
L575091 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?
L575090 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Just now?  Overnight?
L575089 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Overnight.  What about just now?
L575088 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Get seven years, did you?
L575087 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Who remembers.
L575086 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Did you.  What was that in aid of?
L575085 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.
L575084 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
L575083 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ From pursuing your chosen profession.
L575082 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Hey?
L575081 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ It didn't discourage you, though.
L575080 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
L575079 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
L575078 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.
L575077 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you.
L575076 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ I can see the attraction.
L575075 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
L575074 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Oh, I was gonna say ...
L575073 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.  SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
L575072 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Tell us about it.
L575071 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
L575070 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ You don't seem bothered.
L575069 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide?
L575068 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.
L575067 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as "the early 70's."  Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me.
L575056 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ And how did you get it?
L575055 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.
L575054 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you.  Among her things.
L575053 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ She'd never called me like that before. She sounded more ... pissed off -- angry -- than upset or afraid.  But she never turned up.  I called the house but only got the answer machine.  When they found her ... she'd been going the wrong way. Not the direction she'd have gone if she'd been coming to see me.  Or coming <u>straight</u> to see me.  Who knows.  Maybe she just wanted to drive.
L575052 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
L575051 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night.  She called me, asked if she could come over.  She and Terry had been -- having some trouble.  Lately.  I don't know about what.  On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.
L574918 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ There's the phone.  You want his number.
L574917 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ I'll bloody well ask him.
L574916 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ On what.  What makes you so certain.
L574915 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Depends, don' it.
L574914 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.
L574913 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ What do you think.
L574912 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You don't believe it was a car accident.
L574911 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].
L574910 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You fuckin' guys and your dicks.
L574909 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Have you ever known me not to be.
L574908 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Are you serious.
L574907 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Why not.
L574906 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.
L574905 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ -- When he wants someone run down, you're willing to do it for him.
L574904 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.
L574903 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
L574902 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
L574901 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Right.
L574900 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
L574899 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
L574898 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Various enterprises, style of thing.
L574897 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I bet.
L574896 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Based in London, but with international concerns.
L574895 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I see.
L574894 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
L574893 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What line is he in.
L574892 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ My employer.
L574891 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Who's Mr. Lindgren?
L574890 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ -- Mr. Lindgren.
L574889 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ -- Your employer?
L574888 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
L574887 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
L574884 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.
L574883 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
L574880 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Eight hours difference between here and London.  Would've been, what, ten in the morning, my time.  I was just coming out on the yard.  Now, I was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then.  Bit of fresh air, stretch me legs -- well, stretch the day out, really, that's what you wanna do.  And I'll tell ya:  I couldn't open the paper.  Could not pry the pages apart -- it was like they was glued together.  That's how weak my hands went.  Thought I was having heart attack, only I knew I wasn't.  Bloke come up to me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone all white.  I said, fuck me, I've been in prison half my life, what d'ya expect. But he was dead on, 'cause I could feel the blood drain right out of me head. And I knew ...  Something had happened to Jen.
L574879 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ That's what was estimated.
L574878 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.
L574875 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Where you get your bank statements.
L574874 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Something like that, yeah.
L574873 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What's that, like a P.O. box.
L574872 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Nah, accommodation address.
L574871 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?
L574870 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.
L574869 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
L574868 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
L574867 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
L574866 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ He give me your address.
L574865 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I should really give him a call.  He's a character, isn't he.  Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.
L574864 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
L574863 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ And you've seen Eddie Rama.
L574862 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
L574861 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I might've been away for the weekend.
L574860 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...
L574859 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
L574858 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Yesterday.  Afternoon.
L574857 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ When did you get in?
L574855 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ She was happy here.  However the two of you might have parted.  Don't think she wasn't.
L574854 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Footloose and fancy free.
L574853 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ She was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... Straight from leaving you.
L574852 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
L574851 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You weren't disappointed in her, then.
L574850 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.
L574849 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Modelling.
L574848 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
L574847 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
L574846 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ How'd you manage that, then.
L574845 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
L574844 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ She never told Eddie, though.
L574843 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Disappointed.
L574842 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Not ashamed.
L574841 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Ashamed.
L574840 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Not embarrassed.
L574839 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ I can't believe Jenny told you all that. About me.  She was always so embarrassed.
L574837 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went.  It must've been the bars.
L574836 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
L574835 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Now who's being sarcastic?
L574834 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Oh, it just ended, then.
L574833 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
L574832 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Said it went on for donkey's years.
L574831 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?
L574830 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Weren't you on a television series?
L574829 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
L574828 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Here, are you always this sarky?
L574827 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Sounds like Beverly Hills.
L574826 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ ... No, I went in for more improving pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.
L574824 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Try calling me again.
L574823 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Here, aren't you gonna let me in.
L574822 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Well, that kind of security can't be bought.  Must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you.
L574821 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
L574820 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
L574819 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
L574818 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.
L574817 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ It was the bars, then.
L574816 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
L574815 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ What was that, then?
L574814 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ That's not what I heard.
L574813 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
L574812 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ It's been a while.
L574811 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ How d'you mean?
L574810 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Been busy, have you.
L574809 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Sort a few things out.
L574808 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ No, why did you come here?
L574807 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
L574806 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Why did you come here?
L574805 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ She used to pinch 'em off me.  Funny that.  One thing she never tried to get me to stop.
L574804 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Not her brand.
L574803 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Perhaps it was the smoke.
L574802 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You look alike.
L574801 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Had a feeling it was you.
L575198 +++$+++ u8132 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ FEATHER +++$+++ What am I doing?
L575197 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ And that is?
L575196 +++$+++ u8132 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ FEATHER +++$+++ In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
L575195 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.
L575194 +++$+++ u8132 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ FEATHER +++$+++ But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
