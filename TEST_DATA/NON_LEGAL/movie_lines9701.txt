L138280 +++$+++ u4573 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ RUBINSTEIN +++$+++ You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
L138279 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
L138278 +++$+++ u4573 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ RUBINSTEIN +++$+++ So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
L138277 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven.
L138276 +++$+++ u4573 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ RUBINSTEIN +++$+++ It's alright, thank you.
L138275 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
L138274 +++$+++ u4573 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ RUBINSTEIN +++$+++ The newspapers mentioned that in addition to your being conditioned against acts of sex and violence, you've inadvertently been conditioned against music.
L137806 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Tell me more, Georgie Boy.
L137805 +++$+++ u4566 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
L137804 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
L137803 +++$+++ u4566 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Not tonight - not this nochy.
L137792 +++$+++ u4566 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Oh, the old moloko-plus first, would you not say
L137791 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
L137790 +++$+++ u4566 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
L137789 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ And what will you do with the big, big, money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it.
L137783 +++$+++ u4566 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Well, we go round shop crasting and the like, coming out with a pitiful rookerful of money each.
L137782 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ New way? What's this about a new way? There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, and no error. Let me hear more.
L137781 +++$+++ u4566 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ All right, no more picking on Dim, brother. That's part of the new way.
L137778 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Appy polly loggies. I had something of a pain in the gulliver so had to sleep. I was not awakened when I gave orders for awakening.
L137777 +++$+++ u4566 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ We got worried. There we were waiting and drinking away at the old knify Moloko and you had not turned up and we thought you might have been like offended by something or other, so around we come to your abode.
L138378 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Thank you, Fred. Thank you. Minister turns and signals. Door opens and a crowd of cameramen and reporters rush in. Aides push two 6-foot loudspeakers and a Hi-Fi on a trolley.
L138377 +++$+++ u4569 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ MINISTER +++$+++ One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
L138376 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Surprise?
L138375 +++$+++ u4569 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ MINISTER +++$+++ Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.
L138374 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.
L138373 +++$+++ u4569 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ MINISTER +++$+++ My name is Frederick. As I was saying, Alex, you can be instrumental in changing the public verdict. Do you understand, Alex? Have I made myself clear?
L138372 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Certainly, sir. What do they call you at home?
L138371 +++$+++ u4569 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ MINISTER +++$+++ Mmmm, possibly. Yes. But public opinion has a way of changing and you, Alex, if I may call you, Alex?
L138370 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Well, who can blame them, sir?
L138369 +++$+++ u4569 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ MINISTER +++$+++ We always help our friends, don't we?  It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.
L138368 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Helping you, sir?
L138367 +++$+++ u4569 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ MINISTER +++$+++ You must have an interesting job at a salary which you would regard as adequate. Not only for the job which you are going to do and in compensation for what you believe you have suffered, but also because you are helping us.
L138366 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What job and how much?
L138365 +++$+++ u4569 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ MINISTER +++$+++ We put him away where he can do you no harm. You see we are looking after your interests. We are interested in you, and when you leave here you will have no further worries. We shall see to everything... a good job on a good salary.
L138364 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Where is he now, sir?
L138363 +++$+++ u4569 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ MINISTER +++$+++ I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right, you're the best of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man - a writer of subversive literature - who has been howling for your blood. He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you're safe from him now, we've put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h
L138362 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Thank you, sir.
L138361 +++$+++ u4569 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ MINISTER +++$+++ Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
L138360 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
L138359 +++$+++ u4569 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ MINISTER +++$+++ Yes... well good to see you on the mend. I've kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now I've come to see you personally to see how you're getting along.
L138358 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes, sir, and a very lovely place it is too, sir, when I wake up in the middle of the night with my pain.
L138351 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Hi, hi, hi there, my little droogies.
L138350 +++$+++ u4569 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ MINISTER +++$+++ Good evening, my boy.
L138120 +++$+++ u4569 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ MINISTER +++$+++ Fine. Absolutely fine. You see, Ladies and Gentlemen our subject is, you see, impelled towards good by paradoxically being impelled toward evil. The intention to act violently is accompanied by strong feelings of physical distress. To counter these, the subject has to switch to a diametrically opposed attitude. Any questions? Priest rises and moves to Alex.
L138119 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
L138118 +++$+++ u4569 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ MINISTER +++$+++ Good.
L138117 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No, sir, I feel really great.
L138116 +++$+++ u4569 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ MINISTER +++$+++ Not feeling too bad now are you?
L138115 +++$+++ u4569 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ MINISTER +++$+++ Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
L138114 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness, like a detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to make his arrest. Alex retching. Minister rises.
L138008 +++$+++ u4569 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ MINISTER +++$+++ Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.
L138007 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Thank you very much for this chance, sir.
L138002 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ The accidental killing of a person, sir.
L138001 +++$+++ u4569 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ MINISTER +++$+++ What crime did you commit.
L138000 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I did, sir.
L137999 +++$+++ u4569 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ MINISTER +++$+++ Who said that?
L138307 +++$+++ u4571 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PEE +++$+++ There, there mother, it's alright. He doesn't mean it. You were in the papers again, son. It said they had done great wrong to you. It said how the Government drove you to try and do yourself in... and when you think about it, son... maybe it was our fault too in a way... your home's your home when it's all said and done, son. Em sobs.
L138306 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What gives, O my Pee and Em, what makes you think you are welcome? Em sobs. Pee comforts her.
L138161 +++$+++ u4571 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PEE +++$+++ Well, all this needs thinking about, son. I mean we can't very well just kick Joe out... Not just like that, can we? I mean Joe is here doing a job. A contract it is, two years. Well, we made like an arrangement, didn't we Joe? You see, son, Joe's paid next month's rent already so, well, whatever we do in the future, we cant just say to Joe to get out, now can we?
L138160 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?
L138159 +++$+++ u4571 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PEE +++$+++ Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
L138158 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What about Basil? Where's my snake?
L138157 +++$+++ u4571 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PEE +++$+++ Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.
L138156 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No thanks, Mum. It'll pass in a minute...  ... What have you done with all my own personal things?
L138146 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ How do you do, Joe? Find the room comfortable, do you? No complaints?
L138145 +++$+++ u4571 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PEE +++$+++ Aye, that's Joe. He... ummmm, lives here now. The lodger. That's what he is... he... he rents your room. Alex confronts Joe.
L138144 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Hey, Dad, there's a strange fella sitting on the sofa there munchy- wunching lomticks of toast.
L138143 +++$+++ u4571 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PEE +++$+++ Oh, aye, aye.
L138142 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Well, still the same old place then, eh?
L138141 +++$+++ u4571 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PEE +++$+++ Aye.
L138140 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ That's right, Dad they did a great job on my gulliver, I'm completely reformed.
L138134 +++$+++ u4571 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PEE +++$+++ Aye. Glad to see you back, lad.
L138133 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Well - I'm back.
L138132 +++$+++ u4571 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PEE +++$+++ Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
L138131 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Well, how are you then?
L138130 +++$+++ u4571 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PEE +++$+++ Fine, fine.
L138129 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Keeping fit then?
L138128 +++$+++ u4571 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ PEE +++$+++ Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.
L138111 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ And, O my brothers, would you believe your faithful friend and long suffering narrator pushed out his red yahzik a mile and a half to lick the grahzny, vonny boots. The horrible killing sickness had wooshed up and turned the like joy of battle into a feeling I was going to snuff it. Minister rises.
L138110 +++$+++ u4568 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ LARDFACE +++$+++ ... And again... Go on!!! Again! There's a good boy.
L138109 +++$+++ u4568 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ LARDFACE +++$+++ You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
L138108 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Let me get up.
L138107 +++$+++ u4568 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ LARDFACE +++$+++ You wanna be sick?
L138106 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I wanna be sick.
L138105 +++$+++ u4568 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ LARDFACE +++$+++ You're gonna be sick are you?
L138104 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I'm gonna be sick.
L138103 +++$+++ u4568 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ LARDFACE +++$+++ ... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.
L138102 +++$+++ u4568 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ LARDFACE +++$+++ ... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.
L138101 +++$+++ u4568 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ LARDFACE +++$+++ ... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
L138100 +++$+++ u4568 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ LARDFACE +++$+++ You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
L138099 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.
L138098 +++$+++ u4568 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ LARDFACE +++$+++ Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.
L138097 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
L138096 +++$+++ u4568 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ LARDFACE +++$+++ What do I want?
L138095 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No, brother. What d'you want?
L138094 +++$+++ u4568 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ LARDFACE +++$+++ Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
L138093 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
L138092 +++$+++ u4568 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ LARDFACE +++$+++ Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.
L138027 +++$+++ u4558 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ CHIEF GUARD +++$+++ Right. Halt the prisoner. Good morning, sir, I'm Chief Officer Barnes. I've got 655321 on a transfer from Parkmoor to the Ludovico Centre, sir!
L138026 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ The next morning I was taken to the Ludovico Medical Facility, outside the town centre, and I felt a malenky bit sad having to say goodbye to the old Staja, as you always will when you leave a place you've like gotten used to. Chief Guard briskly leads the way for Alex and escort. They move into reception hall where the Doctor stands.
L137998 +++$+++ u4558 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ CHIEF GUARD +++$+++ Shut your bleedin' hole!!!
L137997 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You're absolutely right, sir.
L137931 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes, sir.

L137898 +++$+++ u4558 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ CHIEF GUARD +++$+++ Brown hair, is it?
L137897 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
L137896 +++$+++ u4558 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ CHIEF GUARD +++$+++ Do you mean Church of England?

L137887 +++$+++ u4558 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ CHIEF GUARD +++$+++ The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
L137886 +++$+++ u4558 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ CHIEF GUARD +++$+++ Right. Sign here for your valuable property. Alex signs.
L137885 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No, sir.

One pocket comb - black plastic. One address book - imitation red leather. One ten penny piece. One white metal wristlet watch, "Timawrist" on a white metal expanding bracelet. Anything else in your pockets?
L137883 +++$+++ u4558 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ CHIEF GUARD +++$+++ Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.
L137882 +++$+++ u4558 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ CHIEF GUARD +++$+++ Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
L137881 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes sir.
L137880 +++$+++ u4558 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ CHIEF GUARD +++$+++ Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!

L138075 +++$+++ u4562 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ DR. BRANOM +++$+++ Are you referring to the background score?
L138069 +++$+++ u4562 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ DR. BRANOM +++$+++ You felt ill this afternoon because you're getting better. You see, when we're healthy we respond to the presence of the hateful with fear and nausea. You're becoming healthy that's all. By this time tomorrow you'll be healthier still.
L138068 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.
L138067 +++$+++ u4562 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ DR. BRANOM +++$+++ Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.
L138066 +++$+++ u4555 +++$+++ m301 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ But it was horrible.
