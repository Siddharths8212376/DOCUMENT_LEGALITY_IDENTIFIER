L258938 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ You want to take a walk with me?
L258937 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I have so much to tell you.
L258934 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
L258933 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Was the trip okay?
L258926 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Tubab means white man.
L258925 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L258924 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ No. I am a "tubab."
L258923 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
L258922 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Yes?
L258881 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ And I have two choices. I can either fight the way things are, or accept them.  See, I always knew I loved you more. Didn't bother me. I always felt lucky... a little amazed... that such a vibrant, beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me... And I guess I thought as long as I did everything right -- if I was the best husband I could be, the best father... even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant for us... if I could do all that, it wouldn't make any difference if we loved each other the same or not... I wasn't asking for more. I told myself I didn't need more.  But you don't know how you feel about me. You don't know... if you want a life with me anymore...  And I don't want you to come home until you do know...  ... one way or the other.
L258880 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I don't understa-
L258879 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me.
L258877 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L258876 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Take your time.
L258875 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah, what?
L258874 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ May I have a suggestion?
L258873 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.
L258872 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
L258871 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
L258811 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Let's not talk about that now.
L258810 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ How are you feeling about work?
L258809 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.
L258808 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ You were right about coming here. I'm sorry for not thinking...
L258807 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I can see why you put your faith in him. He's a genuine... good guy... Good at what he does. That's rare.
L258806 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
L258805 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
L258804 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You're allergic to hay.
L258803 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
L258487 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Honey, I hope you're not endangering your position. Listen, if you need to come back and you want me to come take over, for a while, I'll work it out. I mean, the firm's got other lawyers, but the magazine's got only one of you.
L258486 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
L258485 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
L258484 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ About what?
L258483 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.
L258482 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I wish I did.
L258481 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
L258480 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Huh-huh. You?
L258479 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Everything all right.
L258478 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Oh well... branding will do that to you.
L258477 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
L258476 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I thought you guys were going to call me.
L258372 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Night.
L258371 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Good night.
L258370 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I know. We miss you too.
L258369 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I miss you, Annie.
L258368 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Okay.
L258367 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
L258366 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
L258365 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ When are you coming home?
L258364 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
L258363 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
L258362 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, it's good that you're there.
L258361 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.
L258360 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit?
L258152 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right.
L258151 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ And you think it's best if I don't come.
L258150 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ She will if you think she should.
L258149 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ What if she doesn't want to go?
L258148 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her.  I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it!
L258147 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I really wish I could understand why you think this is so necessary.
L258144 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I'm not pretending anything!
L258143 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
L258142 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
L258141 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
L258140 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
L258139 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Why?!
L258138 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
L258137 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer...
L258136 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
L258135 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
L258134 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --
L258133 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.
L258132 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
L258131 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No. I was just researching. Calm down.
L258130 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ You've already made arrangements!?
L258129 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
L258128 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?
L258127 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
L258126 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
L258125 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
L258124 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I don't understand. You just said he said no.
L258122 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses...
L258121 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ What was I saying?
L258118 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No.
L258117 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ What did he say?
L258116 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L258115 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
L258114 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ They're still our friends, Annie. It's nothing serious. You kid about them all the time... And I could tell Paul really appreciated me being there.
L258113 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Why did you go?
L258112 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.
L258111 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ How was the dinner?
L257997 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Helping all the time! Running to her every time she trips or falls... Anticipating her all the time.
L257996 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Doing what?
L257995 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You've got to stop doing that?
L257976 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Do you? Do you really?
L257975 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I love you.
L257974 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Aw... that's so sweet.
L257973 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
L257972 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early.
L257971 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ How's my pregnant chick!
L257970 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Sing it to me, Frankie!
L257969 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ "... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'...
L257966 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh. Right. I'll call him.
L257965 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ ... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria?
L257964 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ It's on the table by the phone. I didn't know what to tell him...  ... Whether or not we were...  ... if we still we're thinking of redoing the couch.
L257963 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Okay.
L257962 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...
L257961 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ The funeral's on Friday.
L257960 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ We're very lucky.
L257959 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I saw Judith's parents while you were at the apartment...  I wanted to say something...  But I... I was so relieved that Grace was still... that it wasn't our daughter.
L257958 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No, I'll go. You stay... In case she wakes up.
L257957 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ No, let me go.
L257956 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I should go get some of her things.
L257954 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
L257953 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What did he say?
L257930 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Tch. What are you --
L257929 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L257924 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Robert, you leave it up these people...!
L257923 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
L257922 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That bag's almost empty.
L257910 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging...
L257909 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What about Grace?
L257868 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah. Bye.
L257867 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Okay. We'll see you later then.
L257866 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I don't know. We'll figure it out.
L257865 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?
L257864 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.
L257863 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Riding with Judith.
L257862 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Sure... What's Grace up to?
L257861 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Okay. You want me to pick you up?
L257860 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I should be in by two.
L257859 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ So, what, uh, what train are you taking?
L257858 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Hi.
L257857 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Hi.
L257856 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It's me.
L258853 +++$+++ u5677 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Either fight the way things are or accept it.
L258852 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What choice!!?
L258851 +++$+++ u5677 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No. He had the choice.
L258850 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It's so cruel.
L258631 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
L258630 +++$+++ u5677 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
L258623 +++$+++ u5677 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We have a business manager. The best around.
L258622 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
L258350 +++$+++ u5677 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Well, I know Peterson's. Old place is as good as falling down around your ears.
L258349 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, I don't know...
L258348 +++$+++ u5677 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Nobody's using it. Silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well...
L258344 +++$+++ u5677 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow.  Would you mind passing that salad young lady?
L258343 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows...  I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to...  do their... work.
L258866 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You too, Diane.
L258865 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Good luck to you, Annie.
L258864 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Promise.
L258863 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Promise?
L258862 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks.
L258860 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for.  Between you and me, I could use the time alone.
L258859 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing.
L258799 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, how sweet.
L258798 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart.
L258780 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No, no, I'll go -- just give me a list.
L258779 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Well, I am going to go after lunch.
L258778 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
L258764 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
L258763 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
L258762 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
L258761 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What?
L258760 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Yes, it does.
L258759 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Sounds like something Tom would say.
L258758 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...
L258757 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Frank's a good man.
L258756 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
L258755 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
L258754 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Guess you don't have to figure it out until you go home.
L258753 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
L258752 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ You don't seem to upset?
L258751 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No, it's more like a leave of-  Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
L258750 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ They fired you?
L258749 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
L258748 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?
L258651 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.
L258650 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You and Frank ever take a vacation?
L258649 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I'd love to go there one time...
L258648 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.
L258647 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...
L258646 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ What was it like?
L258645 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I was there for that shot, actually.
L258644 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?
L258643 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ No reason you should, no reason you should.
L258642 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
L258641 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I'll help you with the coffee.
L258525 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Oh, it's... I wanted to tell you that, if you'd like, you being so busy, I could take Grace to her therapy exercises for you. I have to go in once a week for shopping anyway.
L258524 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Thank you. You're all doing too much.
L258445 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
L258444 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
L258443 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Always did. I think she favored him a little. You tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same.
L258442 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ She calls him Tommy...
L258441 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...
L258439 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.
L258438 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Where does this go, Diane?
L258346 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel.
L258345 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ How's Peterson's holding up for you?
L258332 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ No imposition. Plenty of food. Gonna get pretty dark soon. Hard to find a place.
L258331 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
