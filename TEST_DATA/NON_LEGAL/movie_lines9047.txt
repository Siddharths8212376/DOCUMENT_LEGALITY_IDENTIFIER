L194509 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I like to read what smart people say. So many beautiful, important things.
L194508 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Very cool. Trippy.
L194507 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ "The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
L194506 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Yeah. Cool.
L194505 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?
L194497 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Nah, I don't know.
L194496 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
L194485 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Hi, Mary. How's it going?
L194484 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Oh, hey, Patrick.
L195116 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Mary... please. This is hurting people.
L195115 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
L195114 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
L195113 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
L195112 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Mary, people come to him voluntarily.
L195111 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
L195110 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
L195109 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Then why did you ask me?
L195108 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ I know what it is.
L195107 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Nothing.
L195106 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ What's this?
L195105 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Can I... I brought some --
L195104 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What do you want, Stan?
L195103 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Hi.
L195102 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Oh.
L194970 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Thanks, Stan.
L194969 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.
L194968 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
L194967 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ I really like you, Mary. You know that.
L194966 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
L194965 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ And after that?
L194964 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Happy. Happy with a secret.
L194963 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ How did I look?
L194962 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.
L194961 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Once, maybe.
L194960 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
L194959 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ I swear.
L194958 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Do you swear you didn't know?
L194957 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Hey.
L194620 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Hell no.
L194619 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ You better go.
L194618 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ He's coming?
L194607 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.
L194606 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ No way. I can handle this.
L194604 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Shit!
L194603 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
L194602 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ I don't know! I just said that!
L194601 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Well, what should we do?
L194600 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...
L194599 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ I don't know. He's not on the map.
L194598 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Where?
L194597 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
L194596 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Listen, it's not erasing.
L194595 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What?
L194594 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ It's stopped.
L194545 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ You love him, don't you?
L194544 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
L194543 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Yeah.
L194542 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world.
L194533 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Go.
L194532 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Let him go, Stan. I can help.
L194512 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Yup.
L194511 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
L194510 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Yup.
L194502 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ It's a good one all right.
L194501 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
L194500 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ That's a good one.
L194499 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.
L194491 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Well, allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something.
L194490 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ We haven't checked.
L194489 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
L194488 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ You found us okay?
L194487 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It's freezing out.
L194074 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I better do this, Stan.
L194073 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
L194072 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ 'kay.
L194071 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ See you later, alligator.
L194070 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Anyway, I've got to do my tap dance here.
L194069 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ I know. Anyway --
L194068 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It's just... y'know... I mean...
L194067 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Sorry. I just --
L194066 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Stan... c'mon...
L194064 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Hi.
L194063 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Boo.
L194981 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.
L194980 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
L194979 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ It was a mutual decision.
L194978 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You made me have an abortion.
L194977 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ I have a family, Mary.
L194976 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
L194975 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
L194974 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what?
L194734 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
L194733 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What, Howard?
L194722 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
L194721 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ We can't do this.
L194720 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I wish I was your wife. I wish I had your kids.
L194719 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
L194718 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
L194716 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.  I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
L194715 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
L194714 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
L194713 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ That's lovely.
L194711 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You are such a sweetheart.
L194710 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ It's no big deal.
L194709 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
L194708 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ Alexander Pope?
L194707 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
L194706 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.
L194705 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
L194704 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ Is that Nietzsche?
L194703 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
L194702 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.
L194701 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
L194700 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ How do you mean?
L194699 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Do you like quotes, Howard?
L194656 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ Well, thank you, Mary.
L194655 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
L194654 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ Okay, we're back in.
L194062 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Welcome, Howard.
L194061 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ Thanks.
L194060 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Cole slaw, ice tea?
L194059 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ Order me a pastrami for after?
L194058 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yes?
L194057 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ Mary...
L194056 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
L194055 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Howard, your one o'clock.
L194617 +++$+++ u870 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN'S VOICE +++$+++ 1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center.
L194616 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ Jesus. All right, what's the address.
L194615 +++$+++ u870 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN'S VOICE +++$+++ He went home sick.
L194614 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ Well, where was Patrick?
L194613 +++$+++ u870 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN'S VOICE +++$+++ I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
L194612 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
L194611 +++$+++ u870 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN'S VOICE +++$+++ The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
L194610 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ Stan? What's going on?
L195082 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Jesus.
L195081 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
L195080 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
L195079 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --
L194953 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
L194952 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ So, I've got to drop the van off.
L194698 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ That's fine, Stan.
L194697 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
L194665 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ Oh dear.
L194664 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Howard, they've disappeared again.
L194658 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ Yeah, probably a good idea.
L194657 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.
L194648 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Yeah. Of course.
L194647 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ Did you try going through C-Gate?
L194646 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ I tried that already.
L194642 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ She came to help, Howard.
L194641 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ Mary. What are you doing here?
L194361 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.
L194360 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.
L194050 +++$+++ u868 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ Maybe after the holidays then.
L194049 +++$+++ u866 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ OLD WOMAN +++$+++ This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.
L194047 +++$+++ u868 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ Of course. Please have a seat.
L194046 +++$+++ u866 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ OLD WOMAN +++$+++ Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
L194045 +++$+++ u868 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
L194044 +++$+++ u866 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ OLD WOMAN +++$+++ Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
L194043 +++$+++ u868 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ Oh, hi.
L194561 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
L194560 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
L194531 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset.
L194530 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Patrick, we're in the middle of --
L194529 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --
L194504 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ It's a quote book.
L194503 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ What's your bartlett's?
L194494 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Okay, There's more, Stan --
L194493 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
L194492 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
L194445 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Jesus, Patrick!
L194444 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
L194443 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ She was unconscious, Patrick.
L194442 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night.
L194421 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Patrick, we need to focus.
L194420 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
L194419 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ This one's history. Moving on...
L194418 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
L194417 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ You can if you want.
L194416 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
L194415 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ She likes you okay.
L194414 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
L194413 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Just wanted to let you know.
L194412 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Yeah?
L194377 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Yeah.
L194376 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
L194375 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
L194374 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ It's an apartment.
L194359 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
L194358 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Does that help?
L194357 +++$+++ u869 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Then check the connections.

L195534 +++$+++ u872 +++$+++ m56 +++$+++ CHINK +++$+++ Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.
L195533 +++$+++ u872 +++$+++ m56 +++$+++ CHINK +++$+++ The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.
