L487575 +++$+++ u7477 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAUREEN +++$+++ I just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence.
L487574 +++$+++ u7481 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ You gotta go with it. Scary movies are great foreplay.
L487573 +++$+++ u7477 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAUREEN +++$+++ I get scared really easy, okay.
L487572 +++$+++ u7481 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Come on, baby. Lighten up a little, will ya?
L487571 +++$+++ u7477 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAUREEN +++$+++ You are so not funny.
L487570 +++$+++ u7481 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
L487569 +++$+++ u7477 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAUREEN +++$+++ You ass.

L487561 +++$+++ u7481 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Shush.
L487560 +++$+++ u7477 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAUREEN +++$+++ Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid..
L487549 +++$+++ u7481 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
L487548 +++$+++ u7477 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAUREEN +++$+++ Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?
L487545 +++$+++ u7477 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAUREEN +++$+++ Now.
L487544 +++$+++ u7481 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ But...

L487535 +++$+++ u7477 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAUREEN +++$+++ If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
L487534 +++$+++ u7481 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
L487533 +++$+++ u7477 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAUREEN +++$+++ I hate scary movies.
L488356 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Don't panic.
L488355 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What was that?
L488352 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Where you going?
L488351 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I'll be right back.
L488349 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ He's after me.
L488348 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L488347 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
L488346 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night.
L488119 +++$+++ u7482 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
L488118 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Thanks for the movie, Randy.
L488117 +++$+++ u7482 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ I gotta coupla of those buttons myself.
L488116 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.
L488115 +++$+++ u7482 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
L488114 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
L488113 +++$+++ u7482 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ If he's innocent he'll have an alibi.
L488017 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Me, too. Randy. Me too.
L488016 +++$+++ u7482 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
L488015 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Do you work for her now?
L488014 +++$+++ u7482 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
L488013 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ What do you want?
L488596 +++$+++ u7486 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ ANGELINA +++$+++ No, the other one. The one who played his wife.
L488595 +++$+++ u7499 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ TYSON +++$+++ Melinda McGraw?
L488594 +++$+++ u7486 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ ANGELINA +++$+++ There's always someone out there stalking actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.
L488589 +++$+++ u7499 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ TYSON +++$+++ And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
L488588 +++$+++ u7486 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ ANGELINA +++$+++ Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
L488587 +++$+++ u7499 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ TYSON +++$+++ Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
L488586 +++$+++ u7486 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ ANGELINA +++$+++ I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.
L488506 +++$+++ u7487 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . .
L488505 +++$+++ u7489 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
L488504 +++$+++ u7487 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
L488503 +++$+++ u7489 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
L488502 +++$+++ u7487 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.
L488501 +++$+++ u7489 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ CHRISTINE +++$+++ No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.
L488553 +++$+++ u7487 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Reaction to what?
L488552 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ To see your reaction.
L488551 +++$+++ u7487 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
L488550 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Closer than you think.
L488549 +++$+++ u7487 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Where are you?
L488548 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Very good. You follow directions well. Now for the final part of the game. Put down the bat and approach the sign, slowly.
L488547 +++$+++ u7487 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Yeah.
L488545 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out. Do you understand?
L488544 +++$+++ u7487 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
L488543 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live?
L488541 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Good bye Ben.
L488540 +++$+++ u7487 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ What?!
L488539 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
L488538 +++$+++ u7487 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ What?! But I did everything you said to do!
L488537 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
L488536 +++$+++ u7487 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie!
L488534 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?
L488533 +++$+++ u7487 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
L488532 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
L488531 +++$+++ u7487 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ What kind of a game?
L488530 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ More of a game really.
L488529 +++$+++ u7487 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?
L488528 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there.  She's all alone. Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start.  I've got my knife.
L488527 +++$+++ u7487 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ What do you mean?
L488526 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Now let's see you act your way out of this one.
L488525 +++$+++ u7487 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Thanks.
L488524 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Really? You're such a talented actor.
L488523 +++$+++ u7487 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
L488522 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben Damon.
L488520 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ But your voice sounds so familiar.
L488519 +++$+++ u7487 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Asshole, Can't talk.
L488518 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
L488517 +++$+++ u7487 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.
L488516 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Do I?
L488515 +++$+++ u7487 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
L488514 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ I don't know.
L488513 +++$+++ u7487 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Well what number are you trying to reach?
L488512 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Who is this?
L488511 +++$+++ u7487 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Who is this?
L488510 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Hello.
L488509 +++$+++ u7487 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Jesus.  Hello?
L488947 +++$+++ u7488 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
L488946 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
L488943 +++$+++ u7488 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Well you'll find neither. Rina Reynolds, however, You will.
L488942 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ It may be Maureen Reynolds --
L488941 +++$+++ u7488 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ I know every face in here, respect for the unknown actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking for Maureen Prescott --
L488936 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?
L488935 +++$+++ u7488 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?
L488934 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
L488933 +++$+++ u7488 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Nope.
L488932 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
L488931 +++$+++ u7488 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
L488930 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?
L488929 +++$+++ u7488 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Can I help you?
L489067 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ Alright, calm down. I'm going to radio in for backup right now.
L489066 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
L489065 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ Jesus Gale what happened?
L488853 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott!  And either Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her.  So, where is she?
L488852 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers later?  The issue is Maureen Prescott!
L488841 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too.
L488840 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ OK, look.  We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.
L488837 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.
L488836 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Four? There are five.
L488833 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ Yeah, but, if I'm not mistaken, you said in your book that Sidney got it wrong before. She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother, and he was sent away for it!  Maybe there is a third killer.  Sidney Might know something
L488832 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
L488831 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.
L488715 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
L488714 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Please, call me Gale.
L488713 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
L488712 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
L488711 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
L488710 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Who?
L488709 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ Yes well we have a suspect, so don't get that worried.
L488708 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
L488707 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
L488635 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.
L488634 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
L488633 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
L488632 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Alright Kincaid, no where to?
L488579 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ And who would that be?
L488578 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
L488577 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
L488576 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ There's more.
L488575 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
L488574 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ A note?
L488573 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.
L488572 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
L488571 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
L488570 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.
L488569 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
L488568 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
L489033 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ Catch him, or kill him.
L489032 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Oh yeah, how?
L489031 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.
L489030 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ How is that good news?
L489029 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.
L489028 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
L489027 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ What did you know about your mother?
L489026 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Hmm.
L489025 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.
L489024 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.
L489023 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
L489022 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ What do you mean?
L489021 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.
L489020 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Excuse me?
L489019 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ To me Hollywood is about death.
L489018 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
L489017 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
L489016 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Did you request this case?
L489015 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
L489014 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
L489013 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
L489012 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ You seem to like movies, Detective.
L489011 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ You mean like, movie trilogies?
L489010 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ What do you know about trilogies?
L488887 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Absolutely.
L488886 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ Are you sure?
L488883 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
L488882 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
L488980 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ Sid, get in my car. You're coming back to the station with me where it's safe.
L488979 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ And what made you think it was Sidney?
L488978 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.
L488876 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ No.
L488875 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
L488874 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
L488871 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ What?  When?
L488870 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ The killer called her.
L488869 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.
L488864 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ There's someone here who wants to help.
L488863 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ What Rielly?
L488862 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Detective Kincaid?
L488851 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Is that a threat?
L488850 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ When it's a threat, you'll know it.
L488849 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Is that a threat, Detective?
L488846 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
L488845 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
L488844 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ What does this have to do with Sid?
L488843 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.
L488839 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there.
L488838 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.
L488835 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ That is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley, she is a key element in this case.  I have a press conference in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead celebrities.
L488834 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ I told you, I don't know where Sidney is. And even if there was a third killer, Sidney doesn't know about it.
L488615 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Understood.  If you'll excuse me Detective.  Gale.
L488614 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.
L488608 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Yeah. A real tragedy.
L488607 +++$+++ u7490 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DETECTIVE KINCAID +++$+++ Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's Events?
L489166 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
L489165 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.
