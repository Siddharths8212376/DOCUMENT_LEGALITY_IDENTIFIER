L342176 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...
L342175 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very cold. I thought - if I can even save just one... but he got so heavy. So heavy...
L342174 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Where were you going?
L342173 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I took one lamb. And I ran away, as fast as I could...
L342172 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ But you could. You did.
L342171 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
L342170 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ So you ran away...
L342169 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Yes...! They were screaming.
L342168 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
L342164 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...
L342163 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ What did you do?
L342160 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ What was it?
L342159 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I heard a strange sound...
L342158 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Then something woke you. What? Did you dream...? What was it?
L342157 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Early. Still dark.
L342156 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Not "just," Clarice. What set you off? You started what time?
L342155 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ And - one morning I just - ran away...
L342154 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ?
L342153 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Later, listen, I'll -
L342152 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ We don't reckon time the same way, Clarice. This is all the time you'll ever have.
L342151 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
L342150 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?
L342149 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ All right, then tell me how -
L342148 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want?
L342147 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ No. We just -
L342146 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer.
L342145 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
L342144 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing?
L342143 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ No! That's incidental.
L342142 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ He kills w-
L342141 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ First principles, Clarice. Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each particular thing, ask: What is it, in itself, what is its nature...? What does he do, this man you seek?
L342140 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Then tell me how.
L342139 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
L342138 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
L342137 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
L342136 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this "William Rubin", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?
L342134 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Nobody sent me. I came on my own.
L342133 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?
L342132 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.
L342027 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Yes, Doctor. Please.
L342026 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. Oh, and Clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away. Shall I summarize?
L342025 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ How would he test?
L342024 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
L342023 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ On what basis would they reject him?
L342022 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.
L342021 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
L342020 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Billy's not a real transsexual, but he thinks he is. He tries to be. He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.
L342019 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
L342018 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Did he try to?
L342017 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ No.
L342016 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
L342015 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I - ran away...
L342014 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Why so briefly?
L342013 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Two months.
L342012 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ How long did you live there?
L342011 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Horses - and sheep...
L342010 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ A cattle ranch?
L342009 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
L342008 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
L342007 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ No. Tell me why.
L342006 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
L342005 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
L342004 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see. Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...
L342003 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Quid pro quo, Doctor.
L342002 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.
L342001 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
L342000 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Killed outright?
L341999 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ He was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore... They shot him.
L341998 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.
L341997 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ The death of my father.
L341996 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ What's your worst memory of childhood?  Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.
L341995 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Go, Doctor.
L341994 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Terns... If I help you, Clarice, it will be "turns" with us, too. Quid pro quo. I tell you things, you tell me things. Not about this case, though - about yourself. Yes or no?  Yes or no, Clarice. Catherine is waiting. Tick-tock, tick-tock...
L341993 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
L341992 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ "Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center." Sounds charming.
L341988 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.
L341987 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ A moth... How did you predict that?
L341986 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Was it a butterfly?
L341985 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.
L341984 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Mmm. And what else...?
L341983 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ They all were.
L341982 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Big through the hips. Roomy.
L341981 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Yes.
L341980 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Life's too slippery for books, Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God.  Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?
L341979 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ By the book, he's a sadist.
L341978 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?
L341977 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us.
L341810 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible.
L341809 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
L341808 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Who killed your patient?
L341807 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
L341806 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
L341805 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
L341804 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Or doesn't this all begin to suggest to you a kind of... negotiation? There's something Crawford can give me, and I want to trade for it. I even wrote to him, offering my help. But he hates me, so he won't deal directly.
L341803 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I don't know. Is it?
L341802 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Not anymore.  Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford dangles you before me. Then I give you a bit of help. Do you think it's because I like to look at you, and imagine how good you would taste...?
L341801 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.
L341800 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
L341799 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I never thought about it.
L341798 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him, too.
L341797 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
L341796 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?
L341795 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Because you weren't wasting my time.
L341794 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Ahhh... Why?
L341793 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
L341792 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?
L341791 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
L341790 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.
L341789 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ If you didn't kill him, then who did?
L341788 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.
L341787 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
L341786 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.
L341785 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Why? Do you know something about him?
L341784 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
L341783 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
L341782 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Your bleeding has stopped.
L341732 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Advancement, of course.  Go to Split City. See Miss Mofet, an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T... Now go. Go.  I don't think Miggs could manage again so soon, even if he is crazy - do you?
L341731 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ What's that, Dr. Lecter?
L341730 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.
L341729 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Then please - do this test for me.
L341728 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.
L341725 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling.
L341724 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ And the questionnaire...?
L341723 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ And you'd hate to think you were common. My, wouldn't that sting! Well you're far from common, Officer Starling. All you have is the fear of it.  Now please excuse me. Good day.
L341722 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Reasonably so. Yes.
L341721 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ You're a tough one, aren't you?
L341720 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. But are you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself? How about it...? Look at yourself and write down the truth.  Or maybe you're afraid to.
L341718 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ No. I only hoped that your knowledge -
L341717 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Oh, Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?
L341715 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ No. You ate yours.
L341714 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ I didn't.
L341713 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
L341712 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Witless and misleading. Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.
L341711 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
L341710 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
L341709 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
L341708 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ All flayed...?
L341707 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Five... so far.
L341706 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ How many women has he used, our Bill?
L341705 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ No, I came because we need -
L341704 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?
L341703 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
L341702 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ No, no, no. You were doing fine, you'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy, you'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire. It won't do. It's stupid and boring.
L341701 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -
L341700 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Memory, Officer Starling, is what I have instead of view.
L341699 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ All that detail, just from memory...?
L341698 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?
L341697 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
L341696 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ I have no doubt of it.
L341695 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Maybe they'll catch up.
L341694 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ It's much better than your shoes.
L341693 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Yes.
L341692 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
L341691 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ He said - "I can smell your cunt."
L341690 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Now then. What did Miggs say to you?  "Multiple Miggs," in the next cell. He hissed at you. What did he say?
L341689 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please.
L341688 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
L341687 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
L341686 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I'm - still in training at the Academy.
L341685 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you?
L341683 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ May I see your credentials?
L341682 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I am, yes.
L341681 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ "We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.
L341680 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire.
L342061 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Would you, Doctor? That would be so kind.
L342060 +++$+++ u6268 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. DANIELSON +++$+++ It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
L342059 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.
L342058 +++$+++ u6268 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. DANIELSON +++$+++ I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will out... And then what? Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose?
L342057 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Look... search your own records, if you prefer. You can do it a lot faster than us, anyway. If we find Buffalo Bill through your information, I'll suppress it. Nobody has to know this hospital cooperated.
L342054 +++$+++ u6268 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. DANIELSON +++$+++ That's a childish, bullying stunt, Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield surgeon, so you can put away your picture.
L342053 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, she was just ID'd. I met her on a slab in West Virginia. And sometime tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin.
L342052 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ You want to see a violation? This is a violation...
L342051 +++$+++ u6268 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. DANIELSON +++$+++ Examination and interview materials are confidential. We've never violated an applicant's trust, and we never will.
L342050 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Dr. Danielson, the man we want was never your patient. It would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence. Please, Doctor - time is eating us up. Just show me the ones you've turned away.
L342049 +++$+++ u6268 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. DANIELSON +++$+++ I'm not having a witch hunt here, Mr. Crawford! Our patients are decent, non-violent people with a real problem.
L342101 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Oh, and Senator...? Love you suit.
L342100 +++$+++ u6275 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ SEN. MARTIN +++$+++ Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
L342099 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Senator Martin...! You can't trust Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling. It's such a game with these people. They're determined to get the arrest for themselves. The "collar," I think they say.
L342098 +++$+++ u6275 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ SEN. MARTIN +++$+++ Let's go with it.
L342097 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?  Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied. That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know.
L342096 +++$+++ u6275 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ SEN. MARTIN +++$+++ Yes... I did.
L342094 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Did you breast-feed her?
L342093 +++$+++ u6275 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ SEN. MARTIN +++$+++ What...?
L342089 +++$+++ u6275 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ SEN. MARTIN +++$+++ You have my word. Paul?
L342088 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ I won't waste your time and Catherine's time bargaining for petty privileges. Clarice Starling and that awful Jack Crawford have wasted far too much already. I only pray they haven't doomed the poor girl... Let me help you now, and I'll trust you when it's all over.
L341953 +++$+++ u6273 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ PILCHER +++$+++ The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell. Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time. Didn't I read that?
L341952 +++$+++ u6274 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ RODEN +++$+++ Better known to his friends as the Death's-head Moth...
L341943 +++$+++ u6273 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ PILCHER +++$+++ Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.
L341942 +++$+++ u6274 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ RODEN +++$+++ I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now?  Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?
L341941 +++$+++ u6273 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ PILCHER +++$+++ Your West Virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble, but I finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy - studying the skin.
L341938 +++$+++ u6273 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ PILCHER +++$+++ Officer Starling. Welcome back.
L341937 +++$+++ u6274 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ RODEN +++$+++ Of course it counts. How do you play?
L341934 +++$+++ u6273 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ PILCHER +++$+++ No fair! You lured him with produce.
L341933 +++$+++ u6274 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ RODEN +++$+++ Time, Pilch! My move.
L342603 +++$+++ u6277 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.
L342602 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice...
L342504 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Absolutely.
L342503 +++$+++ u6277 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Can we rest soon?
L342502 +++$+++ u6280 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ HEYWARD +++$+++ Are you alright?
L342492 +++$+++ u6277 +++$+++ m420 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild!
