L338533 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ What is that awful looking place?
L338467 +++$+++ u1713 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ I am Quell.
L338466 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
L338465 +++$+++ u1713 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
L338464 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ You!
L338463 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ A <u>boar</u>? Those incompetent louts couldn't catch a piglet, much less a boar.
L338462 +++$+++ u1713 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ Would you settle for a boar?
L338461 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.
L338758 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ No, no. I'm with you, boy.
L338757 +++$+++ u1719 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TITCH +++$+++ Would you desert your friends?
L338756 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
L338634 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
L338633 +++$+++ u1719 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TITCH +++$+++ We meant only to please you.
L338629 +++$+++ u1719 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TITCH +++$+++ It's right behind you.
L338628 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
L338627 +++$+++ u1719 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TITCH +++$+++ I don't think it's working.
L338626 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
L338625 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend.
L338624 +++$+++ u1719 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TITCH +++$+++ Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
L338490 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ A foolish wish. And you, Quell?
L338489 +++$+++ u1719 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TITCH +++$+++ I only want one.
L338488 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
L338487 +++$+++ u1719 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TITCH +++$+++ I'd wish for a puppy.
L338486 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
L338469 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
L338468 +++$+++ u1719 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TITCH +++$+++ I'm hungry.
L338448 +++$+++ u1719 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TITCH +++$+++ I ...  ... am Titch.
L338447 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision.
L338446 +++$+++ u1719 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TITCH +++$+++ You can have half.
L338445 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ You do?
L338444 +++$+++ u1719 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TITCH +++$+++ I have a cinnamon bar.
L338443 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
L338442 +++$+++ u1719 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TITCH +++$+++ No.
L338441 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ Sugarballs?
L338440 +++$+++ u1719 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TITCH +++$+++ No.
L338439 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops?
L338637 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ No! Not yet! Let me hug it and kiss it a little.  Let me run my fingers over its lovely skin.  Let me climb to the top and sing to it.
L338636 +++$+++ u1720 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TORQUIL +++$+++ Look at its insides.
L338635 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
L338554 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ Hush!
L338553 +++$+++ u1720 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TORQUIL +++$+++ I can't hold the weight of both of you!
L338477 +++$+++ u1720 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TORQUIL +++$+++ Your boast is a bigger mouthful than your roast, Magnificence.
L338476 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
L338475 +++$+++ u1720 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TORQUIL +++$+++ Passable, pimple, very passable.
L338374 +++$+++ u1720 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TORQUIL +++$+++ Oh, my poor stomach.
L338373 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ Oh, my poor stew!
L338361 +++$+++ u1720 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TORQUIL +++$+++ I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.
L338360 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ I am being exploited! Where are you going?
L338359 +++$+++ u1720 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TORQUIL +++$+++ Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
L338358 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ Food for crows.
L338357 +++$+++ u1720 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TORQUIL +++$+++ We have plenty of hares.
L338356 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ And do you think I live on air?
L338355 +++$+++ u1720 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TORQUIL +++$+++ Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
L338354 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves!
L338342 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ I am Ergo the Magnificent, and I do not travel with thieves and robbers.
L338341 +++$+++ u1720 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TORQUIL +++$+++ You had better manners as a pig.
L338340 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ Put me down, you lout!
L338312 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ Get me down from here you louts or I'll turn you all into pigs!
L338311 +++$+++ u1720 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TORQUIL +++$+++ But also very young. Six to one is no odds, boy.
L338710 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ No. He will master the leader.
L338709 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ They'll trample him to death!
L338403 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ...  ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.
L338402 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ He is the King.
L338401 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
L338400 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ He didn't join them. They joined him.
L338365 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ If that were so, you'd be dead now. He was aiming at the Dark One, for there is ancient hatred between them. Once his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained with the Dark Ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future. But they were cheated, for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death.
L338364 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
L338363 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill.
L338362 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ One with red eyes, the other with one eye, both trying to kill me.
L338306 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ <u>Me</u>? Travel with <u>you</u>? I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision. And I do not travel with peasants and beggars. Goodbye!
L338305 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
L338304 +++$+++ u1714 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ERGO +++$+++ My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
L338697 +++$+++ u1723 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ VOICE OF THE BEAST +++$+++ He will not come. You will be my queen.
L338696 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ He will come for me.
L338679 +++$+++ u1723 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ VOICE OF THE BEAST +++$+++ Then he will die!
L338678 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ He will not!
L338677 +++$+++ u1723 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ VOICE OF THE BEAST +++$+++ These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
L338676 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ It's a lie!
L338675 +++$+++ u1723 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ VOICE OF THE BEAST +++$+++ Then look!
L338674 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
L338653 +++$+++ u1723 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ VOICE OF THE BEAST +++$+++ You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
L338652 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ I do not want your power. It is hideous.
L338208 +++$+++ u1716 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ They will have the life that you and I might have had.
L338207 +++$+++ u1721 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TUROLD +++$+++ A fine match.
L338206 +++$+++ u1716 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ A match for your son, I think.
L338205 +++$+++ u1721 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TUROLD +++$+++ A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
L338200 +++$+++ u1721 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TUROLD +++$+++ That I am, my lady.
L338199 +++$+++ u1716 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
L338198 +++$+++ u1721 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TUROLD +++$+++ I knew.
L338197 +++$+++ u1716 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise.
L338196 +++$+++ u1716 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ Yes.
L338195 +++$+++ u1721 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TUROLD +++$+++ It is important to assure the succession.
L338194 +++$+++ u1716 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
L338191 +++$+++ u1721 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TUROLD +++$+++ Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
L338190 +++$+++ u1716 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
L338166 +++$+++ u1721 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TUROLD +++$+++ We will hold. Their power is not unlimited.
L338165 +++$+++ u1716 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
L338164 +++$+++ u1721 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TUROLD +++$+++ The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
L338163 +++$+++ u1716 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
L338162 +++$+++ u1721 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TUROLD +++$+++ It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
L338161 +++$+++ u1716 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ Freylag's stronghold?
L338160 +++$+++ u1721 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TUROLD +++$+++ Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
L338159 +++$+++ u1716 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ What news from our friends?
L338193 +++$+++ u1721 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TUROLD +++$+++ He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner.
L338192 +++$+++ u1717 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Modred! Impossible!
L338151 +++$+++ u1721 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TUROLD +++$+++ We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
L338150 +++$+++ u1717 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
L338149 +++$+++ u1721 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TUROLD +++$+++ How many did you lose?
L338148 +++$+++ u1717 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
L338147 +++$+++ u1717 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You were lucky. I lost thirty there.
L338146 +++$+++ u1721 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TUROLD +++$+++ Yes. We lost five.
L338145 +++$+++ u1717 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You were attacked in the forest?
L338438 +++$+++ u1718 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ SEER +++$+++ They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.
L338437 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.
L338429 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
L338428 +++$+++ u1718 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ SEER +++$+++ Can you see?
L338427 +++$+++ u1718 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ SEER +++$+++ I will seek the Fortress for you.
L338426 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ It is the time.
L338425 +++$+++ u1718 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ SEER +++$+++ Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
L338424 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ You know the voice.
L338423 +++$+++ u1718 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ SEER +++$+++ With an old voice?
L338422 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ The new King.
L338421 +++$+++ u1718 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ SEER +++$+++ Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
L338420 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ We seek the Fortress of Krull.
L338808 +++$+++ u1720 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TORQUIL +++$+++ That is true.
L338807 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
L338764 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ It is too late. He has drunk.
L338763 +++$+++ u1720 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TORQUIL +++$+++ Kegan!
L338736 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.
L338735 +++$+++ u1720 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TORQUIL +++$+++ Look.
L338734 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ It is not necessary. They will not follow.
L338733 +++$+++ u1720 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TORQUIL +++$+++ I'll stay behind and keep them busy.
L338699 +++$+++ u1720 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TORQUIL +++$+++ It's a hundred leagues from here.
L338698 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
L338562 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
L338561 +++$+++ u1720 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TORQUIL +++$+++ Each to his fate, lad.
L338539 +++$+++ u1720 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TORQUIL +++$+++ Fewer will survive them.
L338538 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ Few have survived it.
L338513 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ She had another name once.
L338512 +++$+++ u1720 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TORQUIL +++$+++ Her name is Death.
L338511 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
L338510 +++$+++ u1720 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TORQUIL +++$+++ She has the power to kill.
L338509 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ She has the power of vision.
L338508 +++$+++ u1720 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TORQUIL +++$+++ That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
L338507 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ Yes.
L338506 +++$+++ u1720 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TORQUIL +++$+++ The Widow of the Web?
L338505 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.
L338452 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ Yes.  Like you, a King. A King of many worlds. All enslaved.
L338451 +++$+++ u1720 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TORQUIL +++$+++ The leader of the Dark Ones?
L338397 +++$+++ u1720 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TORQUIL +++$+++ No maze to me, my fried. It is where we take refuge when they hunt us.
L338396 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ Many have perished in that maze.
L338395 +++$+++ u1720 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TORQUIL +++$+++ We can save half a day by crossing the Stone Lake.
L338392 +++$+++ u1720 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TORQUIL +++$+++ There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her.
L338391 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
L338369 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen.
L338368 +++$+++ u1720 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TORQUIL +++$+++ Knowledge I wouldn't want.
L338622 +++$+++ u1724 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ WIDOW +++$+++ There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.
L338621 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ You will come with me.
L338620 +++$+++ u1724 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ WIDOW +++$+++ You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
L338619 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ I cannot stop the sand.
L338616 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.
L338615 +++$+++ u1724 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ WIDOW +++$+++ It will not help.
L338614 +++$+++ u1724 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ WIDOW +++$+++ Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.
L338613 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
L338612 +++$+++ u1724 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ WIDOW +++$+++ No.
L338611 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
L338610 +++$+++ u1724 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ WIDOW +++$+++ You lie!
L338609 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
L338608 +++$+++ u1724 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ WIDOW +++$+++ Why must you know?
L338607 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
L338606 +++$+++ u1724 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ WIDOW +++$+++ Of what?
L338605 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ Knowledge.
L338604 +++$+++ u1724 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ WIDOW +++$+++ Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
L338603 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
L338602 +++$+++ u1724 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ WIDOW +++$+++ Yes.
L338601 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ You see?
