L285615 +++$+++ u1379 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ CLIVE +++$+++ Fair enough.  The river.
L285614 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.
L285383 +++$+++ u1379 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ CLIVE +++$+++ Where to?
L285382 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
L285381 +++$+++ u1379 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ CLIVE +++$+++ I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
L285380 +++$+++ u1379 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ CLIVE +++$+++ Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
L285379 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ When do you think you'll get leave again?
L285370 +++$+++ u1379 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ CLIVE +++$+++ A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
L285369 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ What are you going to be then?
L285368 +++$+++ u1379 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ CLIVE +++$+++ I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
L285367 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Why didn't they say that before you started?
L285366 +++$+++ u1379 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ CLIVE +++$+++ That's it.
L285365 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
L285363 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You taste it.
L285362 +++$+++ u1379 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ CLIVE +++$+++ Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
L285358 +++$+++ u1379 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ CLIVE +++$+++ Jam is jam! It's just jam!
L285357 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ It looks....foreign.
L285356 +++$+++ u1379 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ CLIVE +++$+++ Well?
L285354 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ How do we know they didn't plant it there? They know we're mad on jam.  They could poison half the country.
L285353 +++$+++ u1379 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ CLIVE +++$+++ Well, it's off ration. We know that.
L285352 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ We don't know anything about it
L285347 +++$+++ u1379 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ CLIVE +++$+++ Jam.
L285346 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ And what's that?
L285107 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I wish you could have told me yourself.  Oh, Grace, it's not for long. They say it'll be over by Christmas.
L285106 +++$+++ u1379 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ CLIVE +++$+++ Oh, that.
L285105 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You joined up.
L285104 +++$+++ u1379 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ CLIVE +++$+++ What's that?
L285103 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Has Sue got it right?
L285054 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ And it was the last. Hasn't written a letter since. Not even a birthday card.
L285053 +++$+++ u1379 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ CLIVE +++$+++ We all had to write a last letter home.
L285051 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ They'd gone.
L285050 +++$+++ u1379 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ CLIVE +++$+++ We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
L285049 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ No Turks.
L285641 +++$+++ u1380 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
L285640 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Now take deep breaths, and push.
L285588 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
L285587 +++$+++ u1380 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ It looks a bit fishy to me.
L285525 +++$+++ u1380 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ It's not. It's happening to me.
L285524 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I don't believe this is happening to me.
L285478 +++$+++ u1380 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
L285477 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
L285476 +++$+++ u1380 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
L285475 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ What did he say?
L285467 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Don't leave it like that. Go after him. Swallow your pride.
L285466 +++$+++ u1380 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
L285465 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ What is it, pet?
L285312 +++$+++ u1380 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ Who said anything about love?
L285311 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You better bring him home, if you really love him. Don't kill love. You'll regret it for the rest of your life.
L285308 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ There, there, my baby.
L285307 +++$+++ u1380 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.
L285304 +++$+++ u1380 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ No, I won't.
L285303 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
L285302 +++$+++ u1380 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ Out.
L285301 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ And where do you think you're going?
L285257 +++$+++ u1380 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm fifteen. I'm still at school. I want to be a nun when I grow up.
L285256 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I won't have this vulgar talk in my house.
L285223 +++$+++ u1380 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ That's why you never liked me. I'm different from you. Well, everything's different now, so it doesn't matter. So there.
L285222 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ The ideas you get in your head.
L285221 +++$+++ u1380 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.
L285151 +++$+++ u1380 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ Well, why do you always bring the carving knife in here?
L285150 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Don't be silly, Dawn.
L285149 +++$+++ u1380 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ What would we do if a German came into the house?
L285145 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Half the time he's bluffing.
L285144 +++$+++ u1380 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ He always knows.
L285137 +++$+++ u1380 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ After this dance.
L285136 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
L285135 +++$+++ u1380 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ You know it? It must be an old one.
L285033 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Just ignore her, Mac.
L285032 +++$+++ u1380 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
L285031 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.
L285558 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Wasn't it lovely?
L285557 +++$+++ u1383 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRANDMA +++$+++ ...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.
L285545 +++$+++ u1383 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRANDMA +++$+++ How are we going to cope?
L285544 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Up to six weeks, I think.
L285543 +++$+++ u1383 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRANDMA +++$+++ Did they say how long it would take to get new ration books, Grace?
L285003 +++$+++ u1383 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRANDMA +++$+++ Or what?
L285002 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ No, Mother! It's War! War!
L285001 +++$+++ u1383 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRANDMA +++$+++ Is it peace in out time?
L285535 +++$+++ u1384 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Look after yourself, Grace.
L285534 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I wish it could all have been different.
L285533 +++$+++ u1384 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ You might still have a house.
L285532 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?
L285503 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ We did all the proper things, and we lost love. That's sad, Mac.
L285502 +++$+++ u1384 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
L285501 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
L285500 +++$+++ u1384 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ We did the decent thing.
L285499 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ He could always make me laugh.
L285498 +++$+++ u1384 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Clive had a job. I didn't. I couldn't.
L285497 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking.  And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
L285496 +++$+++ u1384 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ It's all better left unsaid, Grace.
L285495 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back.
L285494 +++$+++ u1384 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ She said, 'I know you love me, Mac, but you've never loved me enough.'
L285492 +++$+++ u1384 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
L285491 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
L285486 +++$+++ u1384 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
L285485 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
L285438 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ That's right. Not since then Not since I got married.
L285437 +++$+++ u1384 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ ...since I used to take you to the Proms?
L285436 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
L285250 +++$+++ u1384 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Play something, Grace.
L285249 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ It seems to have survived.
L285130 +++$+++ u1384 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Grace!
L285129 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.
L285122 +++$+++ u1384 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
L285121 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I can't do it. What's the point?
L285042 +++$+++ u1384 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.
L285041 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ It was the best time of his life.
L285608 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ And now we're glad you did.
L285607 +++$+++ u1382 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER GEORGE +++$+++ What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn.
L285529 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ How long?
L285528 +++$+++ u1382 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER GEORGE +++$+++ You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
L285527 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ What did I do to deserve this?
L285448 +++$+++ u1382 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER GEORGE +++$+++ And...and...Henry Chapman's girl, was it Thelma? No, I can see those cornflower eyes...I've lost your name, my sweetness.
L285447 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Father, that's enough now
L285446 +++$+++ u1382 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER GEORGE +++$+++ To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson...  ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.
L285603 +++$+++ u1385 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Happy as can be. In the old groove.
L285602 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
L285425 +++$+++ u1385 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Tipsy, topsy, turvy.
L285424 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
L285423 +++$+++ u1385 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Am I? Maybe I am.
L285422 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You're having me on, Molly.
L285421 +++$+++ u1385 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went on nights.
L285420 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Molly!
L285418 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
L285417 +++$+++ u1385 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own.
L285416 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I don't mind it. It was harder before the war. Trying to keep up appearances. Now it's patriotic to be poor.
L285415 +++$+++ u1385 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ God, how I hate all this scrimping and squalor.
L285021 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I know you mean well.
L285020 +++$+++ u1385 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
L285019 +++$+++ u1385 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
L285018 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
L285016 +++$+++ u1381 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ My aunt in Australia has offered..
L285015 +++$+++ u1385 +++$+++ m91 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ It's not fair on them. It's selfish to keep them with you.
L290853 +++$+++ u1388 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BABY +++$+++ Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
L290852 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
L290352 +++$+++ u1388 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BABY +++$+++ Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
L290351 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I agree.
L290299 +++$+++ u1388 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BABY +++$+++ Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think.
L290298 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ The lions were totally covered in this guy's blood... I think they ate his face off, tore open his rib cage, pulled his legs off... it was a wild scene.
L290274 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Cool.
L290273 +++$+++ u1388 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BABY +++$+++ Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute all bundled up like a cinnamon roll of Christmas love.
L290269 +++$+++ u1388 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BABY +++$+++ I know I hate Swiss cheese, the holes make me nervous.
L290268 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.
L290267 +++$+++ u1388 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BABY +++$+++ Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.
L290266 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Huh... what cone?
L290265 +++$+++ u1388 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BABY +++$+++ Cone.
L290264 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What?

L290262 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
L290261 +++$+++ u1388 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BABY +++$+++ Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
L290260 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.
L290259 +++$+++ u1388 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BABY +++$+++ Yeah, I know where that is, it's right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's tree. I can show ya.
L290250 +++$+++ u1388 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BABY +++$+++ Yeah, icky. This one guy stops and I look in and he's got his thing out waving it around like a drunk monkey.
L290249 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Yikes.
L290248 +++$+++ u1388 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BABY +++$+++ Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
L290247 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Really, that's a long time.
L290246 +++$+++ u1388 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BABY +++$+++ Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.
L290851 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting.
L290850 +++$+++ u1388 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BABY +++$+++ Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming.
