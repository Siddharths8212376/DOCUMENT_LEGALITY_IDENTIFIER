L478569 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Yes.  We have heaven.
L478568 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
L478567 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Fine.
L478566 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
L478565 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ See you in the next world.
L478564 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.
L478563 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Fine with me.
L478562 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
L478561 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Well we're not friends.
L478560 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
L478559 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I'm not used to having a partner.
L478558 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ It doesn't matter.
L478557 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Why did you help me?
L478556 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.
L478555 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Shhh, my head hurts.
L478554 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a thing for her.
L478553 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.
L478552 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ She saved our lives.
L478551 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.
L478550 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Are you okay?
L478503 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Snoopy is about six inches taller than you.  I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a chance.
L478502 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.
L478501 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
L478500 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ She never even looked at you.
L478499 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
L478498 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
L478497 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.
L478471 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ We can help you.  I'm a detective in Hong Kong.
L478470 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Let me see it again?
L478465 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ It's a bomb.
L478464 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I wouldn't do that!!!
L478462 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Take it!
L478461 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Get it out of here!
L478460 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ There's people up here!
L478459 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Wait!  There's people down there!
L478452 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I don't need a turn!
L478451 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ It's your turn!
L478450 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Pick it up!
L478444 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ She's walking back towards the door.
L478443 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I don't understand?
L478442 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a microphone.  Lee, she's wired...
L478441 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ What is it?
L478440 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
L478439 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ What?
L478438 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
L478435 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.
L478434 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
L478433 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
L478432 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I don't want to hear this.
L478431 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
L478430 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ What's she doing?
L478429 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.
L478428 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ No.  It's not right.
L478427 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Gimme the binoculars.
L478426 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ She's getting undressed.
L478425 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What's going on?
L478424 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice?
L478423 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
L478422 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Is it hot in here?
L478421 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Nothing.  I said nothing.
L478420 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What did you say?
L478419 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Slow down, baby.
L478418 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I'll try to stay awake.  It's so boring.
L478417 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
L478416 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ She's just standing around -- not doing much.
L478412 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ She hated my voice.  Said it drove her crazy.  I sang to her all the time - in bed - in the shower - I thought she liked it.  She finally told me it was driving her crazy.
L478411 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Excuse me?
L478410 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ No.  It was my singing.
L478409 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
L478408 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ It's a long story.
L478407 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?
L478406 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
L478405 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You pull a muscle or something?
L478404 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
L478403 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
L478402 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Carter, there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now.
L478401 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Look at her.  Now, wake me in an hour, I'll take over.
L478400 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ How do you know?
L478399 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ He'll be back soon.
L478398 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
L478397 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?
L478396 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ The same place you find all RichWhiteMen.  Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.
L478395 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
L478394 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
L478393 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
L478392 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
L478391 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ You sound like that all the time.
L478390 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
L478389 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ How do you know he's our man?
L478388 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
L478387 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Who?
L478386 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
L478385 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Follow the RichWhiteMan...
L478384 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
L478383 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Follow the Rich White Man?
L478382 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
L478381 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...
L478380 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one.
L478379 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Why LA?
L478378 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.
L478377 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ -- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, I'd go to hell to do it.
L478376 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ You said --
L478375 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ It sounds impossible --
L478374 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I cannot go to LA...
L478373 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.
L478372 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ What?
L478371 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ So are you getting on the plane or not?!
L478370 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I know.  I know.  I am sorry.
L478369 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ IT IS CRAZY!
L478368 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I thought you'd think it was crazy.
L478367 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...
L478366 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ No, no, that would be crazy --
L478365 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me...  This is about more than all that, isn't it?  This is about your Daddy's last case, right?
L478364 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
L478363 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ How the hell did Tan get away with it?
L478362 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along.  Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.
L478360 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Ask me if I give a shit.
L478359 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.
L478358 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Forget it.
L478357 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Good at what?
L478356 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You're not very good at this, are you?
L478355 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ No.  She's a school teacher.
L478354 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
L478353 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
L478352 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
L478351 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
L478350 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
L478327 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What the hell is going on here?
L478326 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
L478325 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
L478324 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I'm okay, you go.
L478323 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What, leave you alone so he can cap you?
L478314 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
L478313 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
L478312 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Who?
L478311 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Not Yu.  You!
L478310 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Detective Yu?  Never met him.
L478309 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ You.
L478308 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Who died?
L478307 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Carter?
L478233 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ And you ain't black!
L478232 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
L478231 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it?  Year of the rat?
L478230 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I have plenty of dates.
L478229 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
L478228 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ It's my job!
L478227 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
L478226 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!
L478225 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
L478224 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
L478223 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
L478222 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Where are you going?
L478213 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Don't look at my ass!
L478212 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Goddamn you got a small ass.
L478196 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I'm calling for back up!
L478195 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
L478194 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ This is a very dangerous man.
L478193 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
L478192 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
L478191 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What's wrong?
L478188 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
L478187 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Well, hurry up.
L478186 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ She said I could pick any girl I want.
L478185 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ What are you doing?
L478174 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time.
L478173 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ How you doin'?
L478172 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Hello.
L478170 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I am a tourist.
L478169 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.
L478168 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Carter...you ready to have some fun!?
L478167 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
L478143 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ This won't take long.
L478142 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner.
L478140 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ No time.  There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed.
L478139 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.
L478138 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L478137 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You lied to me.
L478135 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Try to land on your feet.

L478118 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.
