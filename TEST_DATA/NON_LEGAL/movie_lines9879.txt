L258269 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You can make it as complicated or as easy as you like. But she's the one who's gonna be riding him, am I right? So here's the deal. I'm not sure I can do anything, but I'm prepared to give it a go --  -- if you'll help.  You have a problem with that?
L258268 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, that'll be a little complicated --
L258267 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ When I work with a horse, it's no good just me doing it. It doesn't work that way. The owner needs to be involved too.
L258261 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?
L258260 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Doesn't matter.
L258259 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
L258258 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now.
L258244 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Look! Please! Don't do the "shucks, ma'am" thing again!  I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the...  -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal?
L258243 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I uh... ha, ha... I don't think I ever met a lady quite like yourself and I appreciate all the pains you've gone through to --
L258242 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ All by yourself?
L258241 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
L258240 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
L258239 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
L258238 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
L258237 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...
L258236 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!
L258235 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It's, uh... beautiful country. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. There are no signs.
L258093 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I am very sorry, ma'am. Goodbye now.
L258092 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
L258091 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them.
L258090 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City?
L258089 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
L258088 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
L258087 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
L258086 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing.
L258085 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, you know, however you want to put it -- I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister-in-law, I think, gave me this number.  I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly --
L258084 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Well, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses with people's problems.
L258083 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I went on the Internet and found this article about you... It says you're a Horse Whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized --
L258081 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called.
L258080 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ This is Annie MacLean.
L258936 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Go ahead...
L258935 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Great!
L258931 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Hi.
L258930 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Good.
L258929 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ How's everything?
L258928 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ So do you.
L258927 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.
L258885 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
L258884 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
L258883 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Tom's gone.
L258882 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What's the matter, honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim?
L258777 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
L258776 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Let's bring your bags inside.
L258721 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Sure.
L258720 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
L258719 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Who is it?
L258712 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ So special. Because I was the only one. You both wanted me to be so good at everything, so perfect and I wasn't. I was just me. And now I've completely ruined everything, anyway...
L258711 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What?
L258710 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I'm sorry... about what I said. It's just that -- all those times you and Daddy were trying for another kid, I... I used to pray at night that it would work. And not because of you guys or that I wanted a brother or sister... but... just so I wouldn't have to be...
L258709 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Because you are... one of the most... incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman I have ever met. The efforts you make. Your courage and your dignity.  I don't know where you got it? I honestly don't know how I would have handled all this if I were you.
L258708 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Why should they?
L258707 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That's not true.
L258706 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
L258705 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What?... Oh baby...
L258704 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Who's going to want me now?
L258703 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
L258702 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ When? Tonight?
L258701 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ My period.
L258700 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Started what?
L258699 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I said... I started.
L258698 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What did you say?
L258697 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ LEAVE ME ALONE!!
L258696 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, then I do apologize... But what I'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not.
L258695 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Yeah, well, you've done a great job.
L258694 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Listen, if... if there's a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well... if that's wrong, then I'm sorry.  But it wasn't my intention. I don't push for me. I do it for you... So you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know where you belong.
L258693 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
L258692 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.
L258691 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Well, now you know what it feels like.
L258690 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
L258689 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
L258688 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
L258687 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Yeah, you know everything!!
L258686 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Look, I just wanted to say, I think it's great you're riding again. And... and I think I know why you, you needed to do it alone... without anyone knowing...
L258685 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Tom?
L258684 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
L258683 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
L258682 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Grace, I don't hate your father.
L258681 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
L258680 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L258679 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ ... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
L258678 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
L258677 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
L258676 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well...  So you tried riding again?
L258675 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ About what?
L258674 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Grace? Is everything all right?  Can we talk?
L258666 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Did you go riding?
L258665 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Nothing.
L258606 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Thanks, honey.
L258605 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I'll take care of it.
L258604 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Does anybody out there want something to drink?
L258603 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You're right. Good.
L258602 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
L258601 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, one was for salad...
L258600 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I thought there were too many forks on the table.
L258393 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Uh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... I think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's way.
L258392 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I'll come.
L258389 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No. I just thought... forget it.
L258388 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Why? There's no food in the house?
L258387 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Honey, come on. Would you like to stay in town for dinner? Maybe see what movie's playing tonight?
L258386 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy.
L258385 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You got everything you need?
L258376 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
L258375 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Did he mention it?
L258374 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You already did.
L258373 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Did you ask him to come visit?
L258358 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Hi.
L258357 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you.  Dad wants to talk to you.
L258320 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I think they call it a pasture.
L258319 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ He's still sitting in that damn field.
L258220 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I didn't see it.
L258219 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
L258218 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
L258217 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Don't they believe in signs here?
L258216 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Gee, this looks like a fun place.
L258215 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Little.
L258214 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You buckled up?  You cold?
L258209 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ No, you just act like you do.
L258208 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
L258207 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Then why do you want to leave?
L258206 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That's not true!
L258205 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
L258204 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Did he tell you that?
L258203 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom!  You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
L258202 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
L258201 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
L258200 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I don't believe this!
L258199 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
L258198 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
L258197 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!
L258196 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you?
L258195 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You know what I mean?  Is this it now? Is this the way we're going to be from now on?
L258194 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ What?
L258193 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ How long is this going to go on?
L258191 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You were never thirteen, Mom.
L258190 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ This'll be nice. We haven't seen any of the sights yet. It's history. When I was thirteen I used to love seeing things like this.
L258189 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I don't care.
L258188 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I don't care.
L258187 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Would you like to see that?
L258182 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You don't.
L258181 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I didn't know I had to.
L258180 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh. You didn't tell me.
L258179 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
L258178 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You should call your dad before it gets too late.
L258175 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Fine.
L258174 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Fine!
L258173 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Whatever you want.
L258172 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?
L258164 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I don't care.
L258163 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.
L258162 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ -- enough time tomorrow. I know.
L258161 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --
L258160 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Fine -- I'll take my bath.
L258159 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You want to take your bath?  We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to --
L258110 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me?
L258109 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What?
L258108 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Maybe they should put me down too.
L258107 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah?
L258106 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Mom?
L258105 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
L258104 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
L258103 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
L258102 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ What about him?
L258101 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Have you decided about Pilgrim?
L258100 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Doesn't matter.
L258099 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Grace, I put it on the table near your --
L258098 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ No, you didn't.
L258097 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I brought it to you in the hospital.
L258096 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
L258015 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It's still early. What's your next class?
L258014 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Fine!
L258013 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
L258012 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Is that your version of a pep talk?
L258011 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
L258010 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
L258009 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --
L258008 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.
L258007 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, honey... What happened?
L258003 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Okay.
L258002 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Dad'll pick you up today, all right?
L257991 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough.
L257990 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Why don't you go lie down?
L257982 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!
L257981 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Liz is taking care of him.  The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --
L258523 +++$+++ u5675 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DAVID GOTTSCHALK +++$+++ All right. Speak to you then.
L258522 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Uh, yes... Sure, David.
L258520 +++$+++ u5675 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DAVID GOTTSCHALK +++$+++ If this magazine is so important to you Annie, why are you in Montana?
L258519 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What the hell does that mean? How much more do I have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me?
L258518 +++$+++ u5675 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DAVID GOTTSCHALK +++$+++ Lucy isn't you. We're losing something without you being here. Now, I know this is a rough time for you, but I think we should make another arrangement.
L258517 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything.
L257890 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Exactly...
L257889 +++$+++ u5675 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DAVID GOTTSCHALK +++$+++ Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud...
L257888 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ David, he signed an agreement that he wouldn't talk to the press and he's libeled me by saying I faked the figures. You're not going soft on me, are you?
L257887 +++$+++ u5675 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DAVID GOTTSCHALK +++$+++ Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
L257886 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yes. We're suing.
L257885 +++$+++ u5675 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DAVID GOTTSCHALK +++$+++ Did you speak to Farlow?
L257884 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
L257883 +++$+++ u5675 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DAVID GOTTSCHALK +++$+++ Who's there?
L257882 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ David?
L258940 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...
