L556429 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Do you want to come to Argo City?
L556428 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ She's right. They'll string her up.
L556426 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ I'll come back as soon as I can.
L556425 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs.
L556406 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Turn it against her.
L556405 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ How do I fight it?
L556404 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!
L556397 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ She has hostages.
L556396 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.
L556228 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Yes.
L556227 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ And you can see how you feel about me, right?
L556226 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Just one kiss. For old times' sake.
L556225 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ What?
L556224 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Before you go...
L556223 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source.
L556222 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Wait. Don't leave me.
L556221 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park.
L556220 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
L556219 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?
L556218 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
L556217 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
L556216 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ She'll forget about us eventually.
L556215 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
L556214 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
L556213 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Are you asking me for a "date"?
L556212 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think?
L556211 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
L556210 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ But what if---it wasn't real?
L556209 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ I don't see why not.
L556208 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You think so?
L556206 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
L556205 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ And now?
L556204 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more: something that made me feel really alive and aware of things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world around us--like we were a wonderful song...
L556203 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Miss what?
L556202 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
L556201 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ It seemed that way to me.
L556200 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I'm not mad at you.
L556199 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Hello. Are you still mad at me?
L556198 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Hi.
L556193 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ But I don't understand.
L556192 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ That makes it worse.
L556191 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ I sort of like what you said.
L556190 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
L556189 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ But why?
L556188 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Away. From you.
L556185 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Like turning off a light.
L556184 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Just like that?
L556183 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I don't love you any more.
L556182 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
L556181 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ She said it wouldn't last.
L556152 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
L556151 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
L556149 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You can't just abandon me.  Alone.
L556148 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
L556147 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
L556146 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
L556123 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Terrific.
L556122 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Is this how?
L556121 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Well...I guess one is all right.
L556120 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
L556119 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
L556118 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You're not afraid are you?
L556117 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ No.
L556116 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Let me kiss you.
L556115 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ What's that?
L556114 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ There's one sure way to find out how you feel.
L556112 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ What do you feel about me?
L556111 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.
L556110 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You don't like me? You hate me?
L556109 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ All this talk about love, it's silly.
L556108 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
L556107 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ We're from different worlds.
L556106 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Why not ?
L556105 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ We can't do that.
L556104 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
L556103 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her she'll try again. And maybe hurt you.
L556102 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news.
L556101 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Tell me where I can find her.
L556100 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Let's talk about us, not her.
L556099 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
L556098 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
L556097 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Come on, let's ride.
L556096 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
L556095 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I'm sorry, I don't understand.
L556094 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
L556093 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Where Superman's from? Krypton?
L556092 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Yes. It reminds me of home.
L556091 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Like it?
L556090 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.
L556089 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
L556088 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ This is my favourite place in the city.
L556083 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower.
L556082 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ We have to have a long talk about all this.
L556081 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
L556080 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ You love me?
L556079 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
L556078 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Who didn't?
L556077 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You're alive! She didn't kill you!
L555944 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
L555943 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ When can I see, you again ?
L555942 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ I have to.
L555941 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Don't leave me.
L555933 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Later.
L555932 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Let me out. I have to talk to you.
L555931 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ I'm taking you to the hospital.
L555930 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ What's happening?
L555929 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ It's for your own protection.
L555928 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Wait...don't leave me in here...
L556353 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Well thanks a pile, fella.
L556352 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I did.
L556351 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
L556322 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I'll mention it upstairs.
L556321 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
L556320 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ A little.
L556317 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Remember me? We were in a disaster together.
L556316 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Hmmm?
L556315 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Hey! Ethan!
L556366 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan.
L556365 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Why the empty cage?
L556363 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ I'm ready for her. I'll show you.
L556362 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Well...I guess I can't.
L556361 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?
L556358 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Supergirl?
L556357 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
L556356 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I don't know. You seem afraid.
L556355 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Guess! Go on.
L556299 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Yeah.
L556298 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
L556242 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry.
L556241 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You vicious--
L556240 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
L556239 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.
L556238 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.
L556237 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ I could force you.
L556236 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
L556037 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!
L556036 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ No!
L556035 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Come back to my house. My car's outside.
L556034 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I don't want your help.
L556033 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
L556026 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Nurse! Help !
L556025 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
L556024 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Nurse!
L556023 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
L556022 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Nurse! Nurse!
L556020 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.
L556019 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
L556018 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
L556016 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
L556015 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Why should I believe you?
L556014 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.
L556013 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I know it.
L556012 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ And you think you're in love.
L556011 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ They think I have a concussion.
L556010 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ What an adorable hat.
L556009 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Oh no, not you again.
L555882 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I'll drink to that.
L555881 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.
L555880 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Well, just one.
L555879 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ A passionfruit smoothee.
L555878 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ What is it?
L555871 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.
L555870 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
L555869 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ I bet they do.
L555868 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
L555867 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.
L555866 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Come in, have a drink, we'll talk.
L555865 +++$+++ u7970 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Well, there's several ways to go .
L555864 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Finished your estimate?
L555724 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.
L555723 +++$+++ u7971 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What about my proposal?
L555722 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ I've got things to do.
L555721 +++$+++ u7971 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Hey, where you going?
L555717 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ George---I thought you'd never ask.
L555716 +++$+++ u7971 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
L555715 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Why George, are you proposing?
L555714 +++$+++ u7971 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you.
L555713 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
L555712 +++$+++ u7971 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.
L556065 +++$+++ u7972 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ The scoop of the year!
L556064 +++$+++ u7974 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Yes.
L556063 +++$+++ u7972 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
