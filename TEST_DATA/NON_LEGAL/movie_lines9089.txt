L237023 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I make enough money to eat and buy old records... what more do I want?
L237022 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Yeah, but still...
L237021 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me...
L237020 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
L237019 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
L237018 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What are you, a fry cook or something?
L237017 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ For nineteen years...
L237016 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ You work at Cook's Chicken?
L237015 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them...
L237011 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named "The Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early painting of their first logo.
L237010 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ "Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!
L237009 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise?
L237008 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What, are you a klansman or something?
L237007 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
L237006 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
L237005 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I dunno... because I can't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you can't get a date...
L237004 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
L237003 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Wow, this is so cool...
L237002 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ "Yet."
L237001 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
L237000 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some --
L236999 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Hooray for me.
L236998 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
L236997 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
L236996 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
L236995 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
L236994 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ It's not hopeless...
L236993 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
L236992 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
L236991 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
L236990 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Jesus...
L236989 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
L236988 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ What did you tell that girl?
L236981 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Just wait here.
L236980 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...
L236979 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
L236978 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Yes, that would certainly do...
L236975 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Jesus, Seymour.
L236974 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!?
L236973 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I'm not holding my breath in that department.
L236972 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
L236971 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
L236970 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ So, why did you bring this along?
L236969 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...
L236968 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Relax, Seymour, relax...
L236874 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ C'mon, Seymour, please?
L236873 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Uh, I don't have much money with me right now.
L236868 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.
L236867 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?
L236864 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ OH MY GOD!
L236863 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Shh!
L236862 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Wow! Look at all these creeps!
L236861 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Fine, I'll go by myself then...
L236860 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I really don't think it's a good idea.
L236859 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ PLEASE? We have to!
L236858 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I don't think so...
L236857 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
L236856 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I - I'd really rather not...
L236855 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us...  Please?
L236854 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Yeah, sure... very funny....
L236853 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Oh my god! We have to go in here!
L236852 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Well are --
L236851 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
L236850 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ So is that your boyfriend?
L236842 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Let's just say "music" - that way you only use up one...  Wait, we have to go in here for a second...
L236841 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
L236840 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.
L236839 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?
L236838 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests.
L236835 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...
L236834 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Every guy has a type!
L236833 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
L236832 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
L236831 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Jesus!
L236830 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?
L236829 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I really didn't get a good look at her.
L236828 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
L236827 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
L236826 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What about her? Would you go out with her?
L236825 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really --
L236824 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
L236823 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
L236822 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
L236821 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Yeah, well...
L236820 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I'm totally serious!
L236819 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Good luck...
L236818 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
L236817 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Oh, right...
L236816 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
L236815 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
L236814 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
L236813 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff...  I'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers.
L236812 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
L236811 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
L236810 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
L236809 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
L236808 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
L236807 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just I don't want all these guys in there at once... you know...
L236806 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Really? Can I see it?
L236805 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
L236804 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
L236803 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
L236802 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?
L236738 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Hey, I was only kidding!
L236737 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ NO!!!
L236736 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Oops! I dropped it!
L236729 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Watch my stuff.
L236728 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Yeah, sure, I guess...
L236727 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
L236726 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Wow!
L236725 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
L236724 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
L236723 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
L236722 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --
L236631 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Okay.
L236630 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ A dollar seventy-five.
L236629 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ How much is it?
L236628 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Wow!
L236627 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78. She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived, and a great singer and songwriter as well. I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue.
L236626 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.
L236625 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Is this one any good?
L236624 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Well there's a few choice LPs in here that re-issue some really great old blues stuff.
L236623 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Sure, I guess.
L236622 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ There's some good stuff in here... do you like old music?
L236621 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records...
L236620 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Those are all 78s... Can you play 78s?
L236619 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign."
L236618 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
L236617 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Indian records?
L236616 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Do you have any old Indian records?
L236790 +++$+++ u1097 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Right.
L236789 +++$+++ u1095 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ GERROLD +++$+++ Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!
L236788 +++$+++ u1097 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
L236787 +++$+++ u1095 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ GERROLD +++$+++ Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
L236786 +++$+++ u1097 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ They're Seymour's.
L236785 +++$+++ u1095 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ GERROLD +++$+++ So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?
L237493 +++$+++ u1097 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No problem.
L237492 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
L237491 +++$+++ u1097 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
L237490 +++$+++ u1097 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy. Who knows? It could be a million things. It's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain, that's for sure.
L237489 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records?  She could at least have the decency to call me back.
L237488 +++$+++ u1097 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Still torturing yourself over that Enid, huh?
L237487 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
L237486 +++$+++ u1097 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Well, here's where the fun never stops!
L237570 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Call me sometime.
L237569 +++$+++ u1100 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Yeah.
L237568 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
L236563 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I wish I could see him.
L236562 +++$+++ u1100 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ I agree.
L236529 +++$+++ u1100 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!
L236528 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
L236525 +++$+++ u1100 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
L236524 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Please Josh?
L236964 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ROBERTA +++$+++ I think it's really a wonderful piece, Margaret!
L236963 +++$+++ u1103 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ MARGARET +++$+++ Right, exactly!
L236962 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ROBERTA +++$+++ This shocking image of repressed femininity!
L236961 +++$+++ u1103 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ MARGARET +++$+++ I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
L236960 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ROBERTA +++$+++ Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
L236959 +++$+++ u1103 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ MARGARET +++$+++ It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
L236958 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ROBERTA +++$+++ I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?
L236957 +++$+++ u1103 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ MARGARET +++$+++ It's a tampon in a teacup...
L236956 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ROBERTA +++$+++ What do we have here, Margaret?
L236753 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ROBERTA +++$+++ Isn't this a wonderful piece, class? This definitely falls into that higher category of art I was speaking of earlier.
L236752 +++$+++ u1103 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ MARGARET +++$+++ It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
L236751 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ROBERTA +++$+++ Talk to us about it...
L236750 +++$+++ u1103 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ MARGARET +++$+++ I am.
L236749 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ROBERTA +++$+++ I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance.
