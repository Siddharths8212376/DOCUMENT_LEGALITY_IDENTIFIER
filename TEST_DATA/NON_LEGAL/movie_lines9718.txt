L146013 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ You took bets on my diagnosis?
L146012 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Hey there. They're showing "Groundhog Day" if you...
L145937 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ That must be really difficult.
L145936 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ A while, I guess.
L145935 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.
L145934 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What if it's got a pattern?
L145933 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ By color.
L145932 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
L145931 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Sometimes my food, and my clothes, and my underwear.
L145930 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Yes?   Go right ahead.
L145928 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What about patterns? Do you find yourself checking and re-checking locks? Or washing your hands over and over again?
L145927 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ No.
L145926 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Let me shift gears here a minute...  Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
L145925 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Terrific.
L145924 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Chair, cup and ball.
L145923 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
L145922 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
L145918 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I know this can be a real drag, but the attending physician on day shift is required to do his own prelim exam when a patient is admitted during the night.
L145917 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I answered these questions last night.
L145916 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
L145915 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Letty.
L145914 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Do you mind if I call you Letitia?
L146602 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Sure, I understand.
L146601 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I've got a deposition that I really need to get cracking on, so if you don't mind...
L146600 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I'm really sorry.
L146599 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I think I've heard this speech before.
L146598 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
L146597 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Michael.   Yes.
L146596 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
L146595 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ What?
L146594 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I heard about your friend.
L146593 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Getting back.
L146592 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I start on Monday.
L146591 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ How's work going?    Are you back at school?
L146590 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Oh.
L146589 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
L146588 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
L146587 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'm glad you agreed to see me.
L146342 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No way. You keep the ring.     You'll come to your senses.
L146341 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Here's the ring.
L146340 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
L146339 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I love him.
L146338 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?
L146337 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ He's a patient here.
L146336 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
L146335 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ No.
L146334 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Have you been seeing another teacher?
L146333 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ It doesn't matter who.
L146332 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Who?
L146331 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I've met someone else.
L146330 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
L146329 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.
L146328 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You what?
L146327 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ That's a load off my mind.
L146326 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ No...
L146325 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You can tell me anything.  Do you want to postpone the wedding? Is it too much pressure?
L146324 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how.
L146323 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What's so urgent?   You've got me worried.
L146081 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
L146080 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ So will you?
L146079 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ No, no.
L146078 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.
L146077 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ So, what do you say, Let?
L146076 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ No, you've done a perfect job.
L146075 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ It's, it's really nice, Paul.
L146074 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?
L146073 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
L146072 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.
L146070 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I just wish we'd done it sooner.
L146069 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
L146068 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Exactly. It's time to make decisions.
L146067 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
L146066 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...
L146065 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ So, I've been thinking a lot...
L146064 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Especially now.
L146063 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Especially this last year.
L146062 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ No.
L146061 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ This has been really difficult, this whole thing. 
L146060 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Yes, I suppose so.
L146059 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I think we need to talk about some things.
L146058 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Of course not, no.  Is that why you're here?
L146057 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Something you did?
L146056 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I hope it wasn't something I did.
L146055 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ That's a big question.
L146054 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Are you all right?
L146053 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Yeah, I guess it's all right.
L146052 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
L145894 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I think you're overreacting.
L145893 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I'm going to the store.
L145892 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Sure. Why?
L145891 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Can you loan me a 20?
L145890 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What are you doing?
L145872 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yes.
L145871 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ You know what I think we need? Martinis. How about martinis to celebrate?
L145811 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You just need to get more organized. L
L145810 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Yeah.
L145809 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
L145808 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I don't think so.
L145807 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Come on, Letty.   It'll get done.
L145806 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
L145805 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You can get out of the dinner.
L145804 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ It's just I've got those parent conferences, and I'm supposed to set up the math program by next week. And shopping for Ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner.
L145803 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ No, it's not like that.
L145802 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
L145801 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
L145800 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Forget I asked.
L145799 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
L145798 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ But what about that math project?
L145797 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Won't it be hard for them to get a substitute this late?
L145796 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I don't feel like going to work today.
L145795 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You don't have a fever.
L145794 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I'm calling in sick.
L145793 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What are you doing?    You're going to be late.
L145756 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Sure. Of course.
L145755 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
L145754 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Oh, ok.   Maybe.
L145753 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?
L145752 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I mean tonight.
L145751 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I was thinking dinner on Friday with James and Meg at the Saint Mark.
L145750 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Huntley told me today that if I come through on the Benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate.
L145749 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Yeah?
L145748 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Good going. I knew you could do it.
L145747 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.
L145746 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ The receptionist said you called earlier about something.
L145745 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Believe me, I know your feelings on the matter.
L145744 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I really think if you're going to spend your life with someone you want to know them pretty damn well.
L145743 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
L145742 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Can I put these here for tonight?
L145741 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ She's only known the guy a few months.
L145740 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
L145739 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ So, another one bites the dust.
L146452 +++$+++ u4652 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL GAIL +++$+++ Or, of course, you could take a sabbatical the rest of the year.
L146451 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Office work?
L146450 +++$+++ u4652 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL GAIL +++$+++ I need someone to work on budget projections.
L146449 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ What does that mean?
L146448 +++$+++ u4652 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL GAIL +++$+++ It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
L146446 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I've already thought about how to tell the kids where I was.
L146445 +++$+++ u4652 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL GAIL +++$+++ I'm glad you're doing well.
L146444 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
L146443 +++$+++ u4652 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL GAIL +++$+++ I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children.  Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on...
L146442 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.
L146441 +++$+++ u4652 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL GAIL +++$+++ So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.
L146440 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Well, I understand.     I know my behavior was poor.
L145701 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I do apologize.    A student had a crisis.
L145700 +++$+++ u4652 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL GAIL +++$+++ The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
L146266 +++$+++ u4648 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. HALLSTROM +++$+++ That's so sweet, Michael. But, really, I've so many things to do.
L146265 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. You'll love my Grandma Rosa.
L146182 +++$+++ u4648 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. HALLSTROM +++$+++ Simulated sapphires. I bet my daughter would love those, too.
L146181 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I like those sapphire earrings myself.
L146180 +++$+++ u4648 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. HALLSTROM +++$+++ Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
L146179 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ How's it look?
L145967 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'll float you.
L145966 +++$+++ u4648 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. HALLSTROM +++$+++ All tapped out.
L147567 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
L147566 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ You didn't have to kill Sophie.
L147565 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
L147564 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
L147544 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ Hey, you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes?
L147543 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a deal?
L147394 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ And you're a dirty cop. At least I don't pretend to be something different than what I am.
L147393 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook.
L147392 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
L147391 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
L147390 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ You didn't have to kill Sophie.
L147389 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
L147388 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
L147386 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ No. I have it. The lamp? The one with your fingerprints and her blood on it?  Remember?
L147385 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ They don't have a murder weapon?
L147384 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
L147383 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
L147382 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ A pass.
L147381 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
L147380 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ Where are the tapes?
L147379 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
L147378 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
L147377 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
L147376 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
L147375 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ You killed her!
L147374 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.
L147373 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Wired?    I ain't wired.
L147372 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
L147371 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ What are you doing?
L147360 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ If you ever want to get those tapes, meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue.
L147359 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
L147358 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Do you know who this is?
L147357 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ Agent Hadley.
L147161 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ Yeah. He delivers the goods on Zammito. If we got what we wanted we'd let his brother go providing he tells us where the Van Gogh and the other paintings are.
L147160 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
L147159 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ We're talking Matisse, Renoir, Monet. We know for sure they replaced Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve sunflowers" last week with a copy. It was on loan from the London National Gallery and they're not going to be very happy when they find out about it.
L147185 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
L147184 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ Too many people know about my involvement in this.
L147183 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ What for? The minute I get him some other Gavone will take his place. I've been doing this for twenty years. When I retire it's not going to be to some trailer park in the suburbs.
L147182 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ I thought you wanted Zammito?
L147181 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
L147180 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
L147179 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
L147178 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
L147177 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ This is turning to shit. If word gets out of my involvement in this I'll go to prison.
L147166 +++$+++ u4654 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ AGENT HADLEY +++$+++ You'll never get out of the city.
L147165 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Zero.   That's all I know.
