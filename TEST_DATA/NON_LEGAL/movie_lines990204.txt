L446550 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Why certainly, baby.
L446549 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I think I'd like to dance.
L446546 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ How do you do?
L446545 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
L446446 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ If I change my mind.
L446445 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.
L446444 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Okay. You win.
L446443 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Would you mind?
L446442 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Don't I even get my face slapped?
L446441 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm trying very hard to be polite about it.
L446440 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ The brush-off, huh?
L446438 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Nobody I'd rather have on a leash.
L446437 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
L446436 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
L446435 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I haven't been invited.
L446434 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
L446433 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm sure you have.
L446432 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ We have some nice places around Vancouver.
L446431 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
L446430 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ What's the matter?
L446429 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Not tonight.
L446428 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Dine and dance tonight? I've got fifty bucks to throw away.
L446427 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Don't get me wrong, Betty. I'm not suggesting you murdered anybody, you know.
L446426 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ 
L446425 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.
L446424 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Yes?
L446423 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I have a darned good idea you're name isn't Betty Mayfield at all.
L446422 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I think you're a nice girl. I like you. But I can read signs if the print is large enough. It was your manner more than the wedding ring that bothered the inspector.  A sort of tenseness, as if you were afraid of something.
L446421 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm supposing.
L446420 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?
L446419 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Thank you.
L446418 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ No thanks?
L446417 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Very nice Mitchell turns.
L446416 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Nice room. Balcony and everything. Lovely view too.
L446350 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ You don't know.
L446349 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I don't know.
L446348 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Indefinitely?
L446347 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I really don't know.
L446346 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
L446345 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Well..
L446344 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I'll make one for you.  I live there.
L446343 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?
L446342 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal. It's pretty crowded you know.
L446341 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
L446340 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Or Reno?  They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard.
L446309 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell.
L446308 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Vancouver, B.C.
L446307 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ How far does this train go?
L446306 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ You could tell me your name. And where you're going.
L446305 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell.
L446304 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.
L446303 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
L446302 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
L446618 +++$+++ u7102 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ Possibly, Miss.
L446617 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ They might think I was running away from something.
L446616 +++$+++ u7102 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ Crossing the border this time of night they're a bit particular. You'd have to prove your identity, you know... unless you've got a passport. They might even want to know why you're in such a hurry.  Otherwise they might think...
L446615 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Immigration Officer?
L446614 +++$+++ u7102 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
L446613 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ How long would that take?
L446612 +++$+++ u7102 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
L446611 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
L446610 +++$+++ u7102 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ Good evening, Miss.
L446873 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm carrying quite a large sum in Travelers checks. How much of a deposit would you like?
L446872 +++$+++ u7098 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
L446871 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Bank?
L446870 +++$+++ u7098 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield.  Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank.
L446869 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here?
L446868 +++$+++ u7098 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ Good morning. Can I do something for you?
L447454 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ If I did-I don't-now.
L447453 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Do you think I was faking?
L447452 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I think you mean that.
L447447 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Yes.  You.  You're not really a murderer yet.
L447446 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Me?
L447445 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.
L447444 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ This is it, Betty.  They'll find us again, fog or no fog.
L447438 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Shut up!  Cut it out!  Even if I have to kill both of us--
L447437 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
L447436 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Would I want to?
L447435 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
L447434 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
L447433 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Magruder does.
L447432 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
L447431 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
L447430 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Mitchell was dead enough.
L447429 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
L447428 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Mine?
L447427 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
L447426 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note, baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.
L447424 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I'm still on course to Victoria. Nobody saw you get on board, nobody seen you since.
L447423 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You'll never make it.  You've out- smarted yourself.
L447376 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ So that I will never be found.
L447375 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.
L447374 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I guess I'm a little screwy.  Maybe I could believe it.  Should I try?
L447373 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
L447372 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You-killed-him?
L447371 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Not this one.  And not Mitchell.
L447370 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.
L447369 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ No.  I paid him off.
L447368 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  Was he really following me--or you?
L447367 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ It buys things, just like any other kind.
L447366 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ The money that makes you Mr. Clark Brandon.  Let's you live in a penthouse, on top of the Vancouver Royal.  Lets you own a cruiser. Lets you do as you please, go where you please.  You big, open-handed, generous guy.  That's the kind of money it takes, isn't it?
L447365 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
L447364 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What your father did doesn't condemn you.
L447363 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
L447362 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
L447361 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ In a way.
L447360 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Larry Mitchell found out.  So you killed him.
L447359 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.
L447358 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.
L447357 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Including Killaine.
L447356 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Funny, I never thought of you that way.  You were so close too.  We were all pretty stupid about you.
L447354 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ That's right.
L447353 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.
L447352 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ That, and the fun of it.
L447351 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ If you're doing all this just for me.
L447350 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Wonder what?
L447349 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I decided I didn't want a drink...I'm beginning to wonder.
L447347 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Go down into the cabin and get yourself a drink.  Careful how you go, we're hitting the swell now.
L447346 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Frozen.
L447345 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Cold?
L447344 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ There would be a moon tonight.
L447343 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
L447342 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ See anything?
L447283 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Killaine's wise to what?
L447282 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Killaine's wise.  We can't wait any longer.  Here, put this on.  But stay out of sight until we clear the harbor.  I'll tell you when. 
L447271 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You leave it.
L447270 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Well?
L447269 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ My father died in jail, and he was twice the man I am.
L447268 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
L447267 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.
L447266 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ It's the frame on the picture. But not if you say so.
L447265 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Do you have to leave the note?
L447264 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
L447263 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ This must have cost a fortune.
L447262 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ You'll be safe here.  I won't be long.  Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there.  You can make coffee if you like.
L447244 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ The best interference runner we've got.  He thinks he's in love with you--and he's a gentleman.  Come here, baby.
L447243 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Killaine...
L447242 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
L447241 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
L447240 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
L447239 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ And Betty Mayfield--
L447238 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I run over to Victoria.  Play some golf with some people I know.  Do it all the time.  That's why I have a cabin cruiser.  Custom- built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  Member of six golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.
L447237 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ They'll look for you.
L447236 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ This is the ace, Betty.  But not of spades.  They'll find out about the other.  They might know already. And when they get this--  What would they look for?  Where? Out there somewhere? 
L447235 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I was tried for murdering my husband.  Guilty.  The judge set the verdict aside.  There was one man on the jury--  --but he was afraid.  They were all afraid--of my father-in-law. That man followed me last night-- he came from him of course.  My father-in-law will never give up. Never.  He promised me that.  So I came to Vancouver, B.C. As far away as I can get from North Carolina.  And it happens all over again.  Almost the same thing. Almost the same way.  Do you wonder about this--
L447234 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
L447233 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
L447232 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Yes.  I've never been very far from it, for a long time.  Will you do something for me?
L447231 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ How bad is it?  Bad enough for-- 
L447230 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
L447229 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
L447228 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
L447227 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ If you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, Betty.  Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?
L447225 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I have my own warrant.  Stop a minute, please.
L447224 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
L447223 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ They're going to arrest me.
L447222 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ No percentage in that.
L447221 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I hated to go to that place.  I almost went to the police station instead.
L447192 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ You're probably mistaken about that.  Let's get together sand talk it over.  There's always a solution to these problems.  But it must be near the water.  Quite near--  Yes, if you don't mind waiting.
L447191 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
L447190 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Cant be too close for me.  Right across the street from it suits me.  Anything else listed?
L447189 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I don't think that's on the market anymore.  I'd like something much closer to the water.
L447188 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
L447187 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?
L446867 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ From you, I like it.
L446866 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ So have I.
L446865 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.
L446864 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ No use waiting, then.
L446863 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Nothing matters.
L446862 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?
L446861 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Try not talking.
L446860 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
L446859 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Anything I can do about it?
L446858 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
L446857 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Why?
L446856 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ All right--following me.
L446855 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Us?
L446854 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
L446853 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
L446852 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You don't know who he is?
L446851 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ He's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.
L446836 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ We'll find out.
L446835 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Absolutely sure.
L446834 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
L446832 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Then he's-- 
L446831 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Couldn't be.
L446830 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Then he's got to be a detective.
L446829 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
L446828 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ We walked right passed him. He's following us.
L446827 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I didn't notice him.
L446826 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
L446824 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I know everybody. I don't look at half of life, just the nice half, I look at all of it.
L446823 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ They know you here--know your name.
L446822 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Why not?
L446821 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Dance? Here?
L446820 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Want to dance?
L446810 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ At this time of night. It's not as bad as it looks.
L446809 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Is this the best you can do?
L446808 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Cold?
L446802 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I'm different. I like it fine.
