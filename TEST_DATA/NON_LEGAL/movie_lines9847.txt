L231671 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ Six one.
L231670 +++$+++ u5493 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?
L232150 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ I got the better end of the deal.  I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream.
L232149 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Thank you.
L232148 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ I'm travelling too.
L232147 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Where are you going?
L232146 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ In case you get back before I do.
L232145 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Why have you done this?
L232142 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ No, but you might need them when you get back.
L232141 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
L232140 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ I have your samples ready.
L232080 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ I could always walk.  I've been faking it.
L232079 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ How the hell did you get here.
L232078 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ Not bad, Jerome.
L232077 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ How are you, Jerome?
L232054 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ I was never very good at it, remember?
L232053 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ How would you like to be yourself for the day?
L232052 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ Hello?
L231989 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
L231988 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?"
L231987 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ How long?
L231986 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer.
L231985 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
L231984 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Will you be okay?
L231983 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ You may as well invite her here.
L231982 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Everybody goes there.
L231981 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Michael's.
L231980 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ Where are you taking her?
L231979 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ I'm sure you'll be very convincing.
L231978 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ She's already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothing's wrong.
L231977 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ Again?
L231976 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
L231975 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ Where are we going?
L231926 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ She doesn't <i>have</i> to know.  She doesn't <i>want</i> to know.
L231925 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
L231924 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
L231923 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
L231922 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ You <i>are</i> a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up".  What's wrong with her?
L231921 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
L231920 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ How was your evening?
L231874 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ If I were you I'd worry about myself.  Haven't you forgotten something?
L231873 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
L231872 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.
L231871 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Not thirsty?  We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.
L231870 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Good choice.
L231869 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ If you say so.  The stripe.
L231868 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ I've got enough on my mind without that.
L231867 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ Is that all?
L231866 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
L231865 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
L231863 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ I'm sure I could have.
L231862 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ You really had other offers?
L231860 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I think I was crying.
L231859 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong.  How could you be so careless?
L231858 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ How could they recognize you?  <i>I</i> don't recognize you.  Anyway, you don't have a choice.  You run, you may as well sign a confession, turn us both in right now.  No, we stick this out-- find out what we can but change nothing.  This is a minor inconvenience is all it is.  We've taken worse heat than this.  Jesus, if I'd known you were going to go belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, I wouldn't have bothered.  You can't quit on me now.  I've put too much into this.  Besides, this stuff is <i>mine</i>.  I had other offers, you know.  I could have rented myself out to somebody with a spine.  You want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself?  We'll take off all right, from pad 18 just like we planned.
L231857 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ They'll recognize me.
L231856 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
L231855 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ --You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
L231854 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
L231853 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Come on--we're taking off.
L231852 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ Could be worse.  They could have found it in your eye.
L231851 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ In a corridor.
L231850 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ Where?
L231849 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ They found my eyelash.
L231848 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ What makes them think that?
L231847 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ They think I offed the Director.
L231846 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L231845 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ We can't stay here.
L231844 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ Any particular reason?
L231843 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Call German.
L231785 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ I'm proud of you, Vincent.
L231784 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ It's all right.
L231783 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ --I walked right in front of it.  I was never more sober in my life.
L231782 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ --What car?--Go to sleep.
L231781 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--
L231780 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ It's okay, Eugene.
L231779 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
L231771 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ You know I'm scared of heights.
L231770 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
L231768 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ I still can't believe they're sending you to the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life.
L231767 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ A day or so.
L231766 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ How long do you stay up there before you go?
L231765 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ 11.15 to the port.  A maintenance crew.
L231764 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ What <i>is</i> that one?
L231763 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
L231762 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ At least up there your piss will be worth something.  You'll all be showering in it, right?
L231760 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Keep going!!  Keep going!!
L231759 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!
L231757 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going.
L231756 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Let's get out of here.
L231744 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ You're going to have to earn your supper.  I've got my final physical tomorrow.
L231743 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week--  you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.  Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.
L231742 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ That's not the point.
L231741 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ So what?  You didn't kill him, did you?
L231740 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ The place is crawling with Hoovers.
L231739 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
L231738 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ He was still warm when they confirmed.
L231737 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ What an act of benevolence--a service to the community.  So that's it.  Now there's nothing between you and ignition.
L231736 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
L231735 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ You wish.
L231734 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ The Mission Director.
L231733 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ Who died?
L231703 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may as well pay my rent.
L231702 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?
L231701 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ You don't know what a relief it is not to be me.  Are you sure <i>you</i> want the job?
L231700 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ It's not too late to back out.
L231699 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ God, you're serious, aren't you?
L231698 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.
L231697 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
L231696 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ <i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
L231695 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ You really need that much?
L231693 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ Noone orders southpaws anymore.
L231692 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ You had to be a right-hander.
L231691 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ It needs work.
L231690 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ Wrong color.  It's silver.  It's not easy living up to this.
L231689 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ What about this?
L231688 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you.  You are a disappointment, Jerome.
L231687 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ I have to know where you come from.
L231630 +++$+++ u5484 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ GENETICIST +++$+++ They are not babies, Maria, merely "human possibilities".
L231629 +++$+++ u5491 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ What will happen to the others?
L231624 +++$+++ u5484 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ GENETICIST +++$+++ I have to caution you it's not fool-proof. With multi-gene traits there can be no guarantees.
L231623 +++$+++ u5491 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ Antonio, the choir...
L231622 +++$+++ u5484 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ GENETICIST +++$+++ I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
L231621 +++$+++ u5491 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
L231620 +++$+++ u5484 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ GENETICIST +++$+++ Anything I've forgotten?
L231611 +++$+++ u5491 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ --We didn't want--<i>diseases</i>, yes.
L231610 +++$+++ u5484 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ GENETICIST +++$+++ You've already specified blue eyes, dark hair and fair skin.  I have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness, myopia, alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence and obesity--
L231609 +++$+++ u5491 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ We would like Vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with.
L231608 +++$+++ u5484 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ GENETICIST +++$+++ First, we may as well decide on gender. Have you given it any thought?
L231675 +++$+++ u5485 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ GERMAN +++$+++ There's a way.
L231674 +++$+++ u5493 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
L231673 +++$+++ u5485 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ GERMAN +++$+++ You can wear lifts.
L231668 +++$+++ u5493 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ How tall are you?
L231667 +++$+++ u5485 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ GERMAN +++$+++ Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee.
L231666 +++$+++ u5493 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ I'd have to bleach my hair.
L231665 +++$+++ u5485 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ GERMAN +++$+++ Yeah.
L231664 +++$+++ u5493 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ That's the hair color in his profile?
L231663 +++$+++ u5485 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ GERMAN +++$+++ 
L231661 +++$+++ u5485 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ GERMAN +++$+++ It happened in Australasia.  He checked in yesterday.  No family complications, no record he ever broke his neck.  As far as anybody's concerned, he's still a walking, talking, fully-productive member of society. You just have to get him off the pipe and fill in the last two years of his life.  Excuse me, <i>your</i> life.
L231660 +++$+++ u5493 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ How do I square the accident?
L231659 +++$+++ u5485 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ GERMAN +++$+++ No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--
L231658 +++$+++ u5493 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ I hope he's not just a body.
L231657 +++$+++ u5485 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ GERMAN +++$+++ He has the heart of an ox.  He could run through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run. Actually, he was a big college swimming star.
L231656 +++$+++ u5485 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ GERMAN +++$+++ Vincent, come down.  I've found him.
L231655 +++$+++ u5493 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ German, is that you?
L231654 +++$+++ u5485 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ GERMAN +++$+++ Vincent...Vincent...
L231651 +++$+++ u5485 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ GERMAN +++$+++ I think I could do something  provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.
L231650 +++$+++ u5493 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ What do you think?
L232090 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ A fingerprint.  There's something to be said for nostalgia.  What did you find?
L232089 +++$+++ u5486 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ I've found him too.
L232088 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ Hugo!  I've found him!
L232035 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ They said the same thing about myopia and obesity.  You think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful?  Maybe they'd be <i>more</i> human.  From where I sit the world could stand a little improving.
L232034 +++$+++ u5486 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ Not that.
L232033 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ You worried about the cost?
L232032 +++$+++ u5486 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
L232031 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ Why not?
L232030 +++$+++ u5486 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
L232139 +++$+++ u5488 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ Not so long--just once around the sun.
L232138 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ A year is a long time.
L232045 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ We could go together one day.
L232044 +++$+++ u5488 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ --when you go away.
L232042 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
L232041 +++$+++ u5488 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ What is it?
L232029 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.
L232028 +++$+++ u5488 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
L232027 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  How perfect does your child have to be?
L232026 +++$+++ u5488 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
L232025 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
L232024 +++$+++ u5488 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ What happened?
L232006 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
L232005 +++$+++ u5488 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ My medication.  I left it back there.
L232004 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Come on.
L232003 +++$+++ u5488 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ I can't.
L232002 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.
L232001 +++$+++ u5488 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ Who are they?
L232000 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Let's walk.
L231999 +++$+++ u5488 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ What about the car?
L231997 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Those checks take forever.
L231996 +++$+++ u5488 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ Why are we leaving?
L231991 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ You've never been here?  Let me order for you.
L231990 +++$+++ u5488 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ What <i>is</i> this place?
L231959 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ I guess somebody beat me to it.
L231958 +++$+++ u5488 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ So you didn't do it after all.
L231919 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Of course.
L231918 +++$+++ u5488 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ Of course I think about it every day.
L231917 +++$+++ u5488 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ Nothing yet.  I'll start experiencing symptoms in my late-fifties.  But unless they come up with something between now and then, I won't live much past 67.
L231916 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ What exactly is wrong?
L231915 +++$+++ u5488 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
L231913 +++$+++ u5488 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ I don't think so.  The only trip I'll make in space is around the sun--  --on this satellite right here.
L231912 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ You'll be next.
L231911 +++$+++ u5488 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ I envy you, Jerome.
L231893 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Why would I be angry?  It was beautiful.
L231892 +++$+++ u5488 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ You're angry--
L231891 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Yes...<i>yes</i>...
L231890 +++$+++ u5488 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ You didn't know?
L231841 +++$+++ u5488 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ You celebrate, Jerome?
L231840 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
L231839 +++$+++ u5488 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
L231838 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Does it have a name?
L231837 +++$+++ u5488 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ In the South Wing.
