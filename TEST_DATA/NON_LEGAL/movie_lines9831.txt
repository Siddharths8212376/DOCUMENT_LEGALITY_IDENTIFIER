L220009 +++$+++ u5358 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ VELMA +++$+++ Cute young thing, too.
L220181 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?
L220180 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.'
L220158 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ I want to hear this.
L220157 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ You shouldn't be here.
L220156 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Don't worry, I can take it.
L220071 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Come here.
L220070 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ I'm terrified.
L220067 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ They're trying to kill me!
L220066 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Don't tell me I can't --
L220065 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ You can't do that.
L220064 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ I'm calling the police. Right now.
L220063 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
L220062 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Bastard.
L220061 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.
L220060 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
L220059 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
L220058 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I checked. There was no divorce.
L220057 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ What is this....
L220055 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Gail, please.
L220054 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
L220053 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I think you better sit down.
L220052 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'
L220050 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking.
L220049 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ No.
L220048 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
L220047 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ What's wrong, Gail?
L219914 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ If you need me, call the paper. Hand me that extra bottle okay?
L219913 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ I was afraid you'd say that.
L219912 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Act natural.
L219911 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
L219910 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
L219909 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L219908 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I'll take you to a game.
L219907 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...
L219906 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Just give me twenty-four hours. Please. Someone almost killed me today. People are not being nice lately, and I don't want you getting hurt. I think you're terrific. Are you a Laker fan?
L219905 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
L219904 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me.
L219900 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I don't know. All I know is that he told me a lot of things and so far not one of them has been true.
L219899 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
L219898 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...
L219895 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ You saw a forgery.
L219894 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ But I've seen the deed.
L219893 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
L219892 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
L219891 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
L219890 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ What does all this mean?
L219889 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
L219888 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ How do you know about that?
L219887 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true.
L219884 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ That's what I want to know.
L219883 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L219882 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
L219881 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ So?
L219880 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
L219879 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Who.
L219878 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.
L219877 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
L219876 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Yeah.
L219875 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ A four hundred dollar lunch tab!
L219874 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Why did you do it?
L219873 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
L219872 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ I think you should call me Gail, now.
L219871 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
L219863 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Long story.
L219862 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ What is this?
L219861 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Thanks for the great time.
L219858 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ How come?
L219857 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ He never sees them and I never met them.
L219856 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ What about his parents?
L219855 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.
L219854 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Good point.
L219853 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
L219852 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
L219851 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
L219850 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Why'd you let me in?
L219849 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
L219848 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Are you still in love with Alan?
L219847 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Depends on the question.
L219846 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Can I ask you a question?
L219845 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Just like Alan. It's freaky.
L219844 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ 'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
L219843 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
L219842 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ 'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'
L219841 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ It's amazing.
L219840 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ 'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'
L219829 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ No. He was. I got him out.
L219828 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ You were in the war?
L219827 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I saved his life during the war.
L219826 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ All this goes on Underhill's bill?
L219820 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ God...
L219819 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Lunch...
L219818 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Yes.
L219817 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?
L219815 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Here, take mine.
L219814 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ I mean put clothes on.
L219813 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
L219812 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ I really should change.
L219811 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Down boy.
L219810 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
L219809 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ You ordered it here?
L219808 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I ordered lunch.
L219807 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
L219806 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Can I borrow your towel for a minute?
L219805 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Uh... I'm just out of the shower.
L219804 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I was hoping you'd say that.
L219803 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Hi.
L219802 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Hi.
L219801 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ John Ultramalensky?
L219800 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
L219799 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Who is it?
L219631 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.
L219630 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ What's he doing in Utah?
L219629 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ See what I mean?
L219628 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ You are a rich woman.
L219627 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
L219626 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
L219625 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
L219624 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
L219623 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Alan's in Utah.
L219622 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
L219621 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ I bet you do.
L219620 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I have this effect on lots of women.
L219619 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Stay!  I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player.
L219616 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ I love the outfits.
L219615 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Why do you keep doing this?
L219613 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one!
L219612 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Preoccupied with what?
L219611 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.
L219610 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
L219609 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Damn, I thought I had that one.
L219601 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Please.
L219600 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little.
L219599 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ So were my parents.
L219598 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ That's a strange combination.
L219597 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ It's Scotch-Rumanian.
L219596 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
L219595 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ John Ultrarelamensky.
L219594 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ John who?
L219593 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ John! You used to fly together!
L219592 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ We used to fly together. I'm... John.
L219591 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
L219590 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.
L219589 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
L219588 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.
L220199 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Far out.  Larry? It's Fletch.  Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.
L220198 +++$+++ u5359 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Your call is come through.
L219825 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Sierra del fuego.
L219824 +++$+++ u5359 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Muchas gracias.
L219823 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
L219822 +++$+++ u5359 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ You want I set up?
L219797 +++$+++ u5359 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Very good, sir.
L219796 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
L219795 +++$+++ u5359 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ I recommend it.
L219794 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
L219793 +++$+++ u5359 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
L219792 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
L219791 +++$+++ u5359 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Charged to the Underhills, sir?
L219790 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I would, actually.
L219789 +++$+++ u5359 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
L219788 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ One.
L219787 +++$+++ u5359 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Cabana one.
L219786 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
L219785 +++$+++ u5359 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ In her cabana, sir.
L219784 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
L219608 +++$+++ u5359 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Very good sir.
L219607 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
L219606 +++$+++ u5359 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
L219605 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
L219604 +++$+++ u5359 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ They just left, sir.
L219603 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
L219602 +++$+++ u5359 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?
L219977 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first.
L219976 +++$+++ u5350 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Tell the cops.
L219975 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I'm her cousin.
L219974 +++$+++ u5350 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.
