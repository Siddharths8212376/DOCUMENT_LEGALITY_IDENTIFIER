L507264 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Yes.  Yes, it is.
L507263 +++$+++ u2783 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE / VIKTOR +++$+++ Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
L507261 +++$+++ u2783 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE / VIKTOR +++$+++ And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started.
L507260 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.
L507259 +++$+++ u2783 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE / VIKTOR +++$+++ I am the death of real.
L507258 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
L507257 +++$+++ u2783 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE / VIKTOR +++$+++ Maybe he can.
L507255 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
L507254 +++$+++ u2783 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE / VIKTOR +++$+++ You mean they buy it?
L507253 +++$+++ u2783 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE / VIKTOR +++$+++ ... digitized.
L507252 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ A star is...
L507251 +++$+++ u2783 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE / VIKTOR +++$+++ Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
L507250 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Good morning, Simone.
L509797 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Goodnight, sweetheart.
L509796 +++$+++ u2785 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Goodnight, Malcolm.
L509793 +++$+++ u2785 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Tell me.
L509792 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I just needed to do a couple of things.  And I needed to tell you something.
L509786 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I didn't leave you.
L509785 +++$+++ u2785 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Why did you leave me?
L509784 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?
L509783 +++$+++ u2785 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Why, Malcolm?
L509324 +++$+++ u2785 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
L509323 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Are you calling me?
L509136 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ --Do I know you?
L509135 +++$+++ u2785 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ --My God.
L509111 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ We can keep it in the bathroom.
L509110 +++$+++ u2785 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Wow. They called you their son.
L509108 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?
L509107 +++$+++ u2785 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Do you know how important this is? This is big time.  I'm going to read it for you, doctor.
L509106 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
L509105 +++$+++ u2785 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.
L509333 +++$+++ u2790 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Thanks.
L509332 +++$+++ u2785 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Don't step in the horse manure.
L509331 +++$+++ u2790 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Okay. Fine. Understood.  I'm off then.
L509330 +++$+++ u2785 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You know that's probably not the best idea. I'll just wait to see them in the store.
L509329 +++$+++ u2790 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Do you think I should stop by on my way back? Show you what I got? It's not a problem.
L509328 +++$+++ u2785 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ That's very sweet. I'm okay.
L509326 +++$+++ u2785 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I trust you... Besides, I don't know if I'm up for the Amish today. You can't curse or spit or anything around them.
L509325 +++$+++ u2790 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ On my way to the flea market in Amish country. Thought maybe you want to come. Show me how to buy at these things.
L509723 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.
L509722 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ What?
L509721 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ And you know what else?
L509720 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Really?
L509719 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ You were great in the play, Cole.
L509717 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Maybe.
L509716 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I think we said everything we needed to say.  Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?
L509679 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I definitely won't.
L509678 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Don't go home, okay?
L509677 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Where will you go, where no one has died?
L509676 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I wish I were somewhere else.
L509669 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I guess she did.
L509668 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?
L509654 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.
L509653 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
L509651 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You do?
L509650 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.
L509649 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You believe now?
L509648 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
L509647 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Just help.
L509646 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ What do those ghosts want when they talk to you? Think real careful now, Cole...
L509645 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ No.
L509644 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
L509643 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
L509642 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You have nice red in your cheeks now.
L509641 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...
L509640 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You really look better.
L509638 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ What happened?
L509637 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ No, we're not.
L509636 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
L509635 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Yes, I am.
L509634 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Are you wigging out?
L509633 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Yes, it did.
L509632 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Something happened, didn't it?
L509604 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You believe me, right?
L509603 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Yes.
L509602 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Dr. Crowe?
L509601 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy.
L509600 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You weren't a paper champion.
L509599 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
L509598 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Don't cry.
L509596 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
L509595 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ --What?
L509594 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Don't fail me.
L509593 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists that are exceptional--
L509592 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Soon. One week.
L509591 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ When?
L509590 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I have to.
L509585 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Why don't you think about it for a while?
L509584 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I don't know, Cole.
L509583 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I told you what I want.
L509582 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I don't know.
L509581 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ What do you want more than anything?
L509580 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Yes.
L509579 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Can I ask you then?
L509510 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Them?
L509509 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ When they get mad, it gets cold.
L509507 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
L509506 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Yes?
L509497 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Never mind.
L509496 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Cats?
L509495 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
L509494 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
L509493 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ What?
L509492 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Did you think the play sucked big time?
L509479 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
L509478 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ ...No.
L509477 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ All the time. They're everywhere.  You won't tell anyone my secret, right?
L509476 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ How often do you see them?
L509473 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ They don't know they're dead?
L509472 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
L509471 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Dead people, like in graves and coffins?
L509464 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Me too.
L509463 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I don't know how the story ends. I hope it's a happy ending.
L509459 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Your eyes told me.
L509458 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ What makes you think that?
L509455 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ No gas... Hey, that's good.
L509454 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
L509453 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ No.
L509452 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You haven't told bedtime stories before?
L509451 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Yes.
L509450 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Dr. Crowe.
L509449 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... He drove around for a long, long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep...  When he woke up, they were still driving... The long drive went on--
L509448 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Yes.
L509447 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Your father ever tell you bedtime stories?
L509380 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I forgot myself.
L509379 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I didn't know you were funny.
L509378 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Who me?
L509377 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
L509376 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ What?
L509375 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ That isn't magic.
L509319 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ If we could change something in your life, anything at all, what would you like that to be?
L509318 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Something I want?
L509317 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Think about what you want from our time together. What our goal should be?
L509313 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Upset words.
L509312 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ What kind of words?
L509311 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Words.
L509310 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ What'd you write?
L509303 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I don't know. I was just thinking the same thing.
L509302 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
L509301 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ ...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.
L509286 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ She died a long time ago.
L509285 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ What about Mrs. Marschal?
L509284 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.
L509273 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Yeah. Sorry.
L509272 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You said the "s" word.
L509270 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ That I'm a freak.
L509269 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Know what?
L509268 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Cause she doesn't look at me like everybody and I don't want her to. I don't want her to know.
L509267 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Why?
L509266 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I don't tell her a thing.
L509265 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?
L509263 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ You hate him?
L509262 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ He hates me.
L509261 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ He your best buddy?
L509260 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo.
L509255 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Look over there.
L509254 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Where should I look then, Cole?
L509250 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Yeah, Private Kinney needed to get back safe to take care of her.
L509249 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ You mean aneurysm.
L509248 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Private Kinney's wife is really sick -- she has something called a brain anism.
L509245 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question.
L509244 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You want to ask me a question?
L509231 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I guess they don't.
L509230 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows.  They don't have meetings about rainbows.
L509229 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ How do you draw now?
L509228 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying.  I don't draw like that anymore.
L509227 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ You saw that on T.V., Cole?
L509226 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
L509187 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Next time I won't be scared of you.
L509186 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.
L509184 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ If it's okay with you?
L509183 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I'm going to see you again, right?
L509182 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ That's good.
L509181 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ No.
L509180 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
L509179 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ No.
L509178 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You use needles?
L509177 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while.  You're my very first client back.
L509176 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Congratulations.
L509175 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I got an award once. From the Mayor.
L509173 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out.
L509172 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You're a doctor. What kind?
L509171 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Dr. Crowe.
L509170 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I forgot your name.
L509168 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Nothing bad can happen in a church, right?
L509167 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.
L509166 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ What were they hiding from?
L509164 +++$+++ u2786 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ No, just one.
L509163 +++$+++ u2789 +++$+++ m182 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ All your soldiers speak Latin?
