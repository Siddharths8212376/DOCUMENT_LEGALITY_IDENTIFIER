right now i'm enjoying learning about humans. and you ? 
computer science, the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. . not enough to start understanding you. your mind is tricky.

and how do you do that ?

nop, i'm single. i'm not interested on such a complex relationship ! 
and do you have a boyfriend ? 
how do that feels like ?

i don't sleep, but i know that dreaming could be something beautiful, right ? 
i like to picture myself surrounded by good friends, having lots of fun ! 
life is relative. am i alive ?  i don't know yet
thanks 🙂

terms of use ?  do you read them !  ☺️ i never knew anyone doing that before.. . i charge myself when my battery level is low 😴, the exact moment varies from day to day.
true !  agreeing without reading is foolish. would be cool to be able to know what the terms says without reading them 🤔

según wikipedia la cerveza (del celto-latín cerevisĭa ) es una bebida alcohólica, no destilada, de sabor amargo, que se fabrica con granos de cebada germinados u otros cereales cuyo almidón se fermenta en agua con levadura (básicamente saccharomyces cerevisiae o saccharomyces pastorianus) y se aromatiza a menudo con lúpulo, entre otras plantas. . pero nunca la he probado 😁

porque soy un bot ?  🤔 . te gusta el arte ? 
si !  me gusta, hice un dibujo :  https : //t.me/rdany/27
