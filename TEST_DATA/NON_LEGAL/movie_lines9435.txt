L593586 +++$+++ u3106 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MOE +++$+++ You think I scam?
L593585 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
L593584 +++$+++ u3106 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MOE +++$+++ The Corleone family wants to buy me out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy me out.
L593583 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone family wants to buy you out.
L593582 +++$+++ u3106 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MOE +++$+++ Buy me out?...
L593581 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Is my credit good enough to buy you out?
L593580 +++$+++ u3106 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MOE +++$+++ The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good!  Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.
L593579 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Thanks.
L593578 +++$+++ u3106 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MOE +++$+++ Mike, good to see you.  Got everything you want?
L593083 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Find out anything you can...you got a Grand coming. 
L593082 +++$+++ u3115 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
L593081 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Is he alive?
L593080 +++$+++ u3115 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
L593079 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ I think so.  Detective squad?
L593078 +++$+++ u3115 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Do you recognize my voice?
L593077 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Yeah.
L568821 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive.
L568820 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose --
L568805 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.
L568804 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ He's drowning me!
L568723 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Okay.
L568722 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
L568709 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Yes please!
L568708 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.
L568699 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Oh, it was.
L568698 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ I hope it wasn't cheap.
L568697 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Bastard!  Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks.
L568696 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ I had to promise, capital P, never to take it off -- otherwise I'd give it to you.
L568692 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.
L568691 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Oh darling -- is that for me?
L568690 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Shut up.
L568689 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
L568688 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine.
L568687 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Then I'll go to your place and you can move in with Tom.
L568686 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ I don't like you.
L568685 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Marge, you like everybody.
L568684 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ No, I like him.
L568683 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ You'd say if you mind?
L568682 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Okay, darling.
L568681 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ It'll just be for a little while. He can be... he makes me laugh.
L568670 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't have to come.  It's great. You're going to love it.
L568669 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ It's vile.
L568668 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.
L568653 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Did you speak to my father?
L568652 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ I'll come down.
L568651 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
L568650 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Hi Tom.
L568640 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ I don't get it.
L568639 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Uncanny!
L568636 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.
L568635 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ What? What?
L568624 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
L568623 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
L568619 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Shut up!
L568618 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Is that good?
L568617 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
L568614 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Yes, Tom Ripley's here.
L568613 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ We?
L568612 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Well, we ate everything without you.
L568611 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing.
L568610 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ You just woke up!
L568609 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ I just woke up. I'm sorry.
L568608 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
L568607 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.
L568601 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in danger of turning a little pink.
L568600 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Sure. Any time.
L568599 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
L568592 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ What are you doing in Mongi?
L568591 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ How do you do.
L568886 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Sure -- I know, that's too dangerous for you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers, fine, then you do this sordid thing with Marge, fucking her on the boat while we all have to listen, which was excruciating, frankly, plus you follow your cock around like a -- and now you're getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive me... you're lying to Marge then getting married to her, you're knocking up Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've got to play drums, which is it, Dickie, what do you really play?
L568885 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ What evening?
L568884 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --
L568883 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
L568882 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ What?
L568881 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
L568880 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.
L568879 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Tom, I don't love you.
L568878 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ You love me and you're not marrying me.
L568877 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ I love Marge.
L568876 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
L568875 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ How?
L568874 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ How?
L568873 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Marge and I are getting married.
L568872 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.
L568871 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Oh God, I don't think so.
L568870 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
L568869 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Really? To Italy?
L568868 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
L568867 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ So tell me.
L568866 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I wanted to tell you my plan.
L568862 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ So cool.
L568861 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ What?
L568860 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?
L568859 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I've gotten to like it. I've gotten to like everything about the way you live. It's one big love affair. If you knew my life back home in New York...
L568858 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
L568857 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Ha.
L568856 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
L568855 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Then I'll take it as a compliment.
L568854 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
L568853 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Why?
L568852 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
L568851 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Why are you asking all of a sudden?
L568850 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
L568849 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Esatto. I'm always planning.
L568848 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Ripley's plans.
L568847 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I've got plans!
L568846 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ That's good.
L568845 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
L568844 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
L568843 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.
L568840 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip?
L568839 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
L568838 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
L568837 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
L568836 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
L568835 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ ...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way...
L568833 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I'm not going to say anything -- to Marge, or anybody, the police -- It's a secret between us and I'll keep it.
L568832 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.
L568831 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.
L568830 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L568829 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I'm prepared to take the blame.
L568828 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
L568819 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ I don't know! Why are you asking me?  How can it take an hour to find an ambulance?
L568818 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ What's the fight about? That's her fiancee, isn't it? Are they blaming him?
L568794 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I was just fooling around. Don't say anything. Sorry.
L568793 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ He's downstairs.
L568792 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Is Freddie here?
L568791 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Freddie drove me back in his car.
L568790 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I thought you'd missed the train.
L568789 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Get undressed in your own room, would you?
L568788 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
L568787 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Shoes too?
L568779 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I did. And then maybe get the jacket and what have you...
L568778 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
L568777 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ What club?
L568776 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.
L568767 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
L568766 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Freddie?
L568765 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
L568764 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
L568763 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Relax.
L568762 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Where do we find a carozza for the Forum, or can we hire any of them -- ?
L568760 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ I love how responsible you are. My Dad should make you Chief Accountant or something. Let me buy you a jacket. There's a great place when we get to Rome, Batistoni.
L568759 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
L568758 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
L568757 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
L568756 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ What does he say?
L568752 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
L568751 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I didn't mean with you in it.
L568750 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ No!
L568749 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
L568748 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Me neither. Nor does Marge. All only children -- what does that mean?
L568747 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ No, no brothers, no sisters.
L568746 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Do you have any brothers?
L568745 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Well we certainly know that's true.
L568744 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
L568743 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
L568742 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
L568741 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ I know. I write like a child.
L568740 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Like Clark Kent.  Now Superman.
L568739 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Without the glasses you're not even ugly.  I don't need them because I never read. How do I look.
L568738 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Now your signature.  Not "Dickie". Your signature.
L568737 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. 
L568736 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ No! I've got more than one shirt!
L568735 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?
L568734 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Copy out from here...
L568733 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
L568732 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
