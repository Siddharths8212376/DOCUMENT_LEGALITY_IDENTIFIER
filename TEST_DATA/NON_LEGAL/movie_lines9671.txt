L126331 +++$+++ u4423 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SCOBIE +++$+++ And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
L126330 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
L126329 +++$+++ u4423 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SCOBIE +++$+++ I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
L126328 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Very pretty. Now what?
L126327 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ The view had better be worth it.
L126326 +++$+++ u4423 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SCOBIE +++$+++ Keep going.
L126325 +++$+++ u4423 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SCOBIE +++$+++ Open it.
L126324 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Do I knock or something?
L126323 +++$+++ u4423 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SCOBIE +++$+++ Okay -- up there.
L126322 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Sorry about that.
L126321 +++$+++ u4423 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SCOBIE +++$+++ I said with the mouth shut.
L126320 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ How long do you intend -- ?
L126319 +++$+++ u4423 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SCOBIE +++$+++ We wait -- with our mouths shut.
L126318 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ What now?
L126314 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ You'll wreck your raincoat.
L126313 +++$+++ u4423 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SCOBIE +++$+++ If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?
L126628 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ No -- he's not the same. Alexander Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death. Adam Canfield is a crook. And with all the advantages you've got -- brains, charm, education, a handsome face --
L126627 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ The man's the same, even if the name isn't.
L126626 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
L126625 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
L126624 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
L126623 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
L126622 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I don't believe it.
L126621 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
L126620 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ You mean, you're a thief?
L126619 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.
L126618 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L126617 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
L126616 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
L126615 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
L126614 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Go on.
L126613 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Are you going to listen?
L126612 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Well!
L126611 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Why don't you shut up!
L126610 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Fiction or non-fiction?
L126609 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
L126608 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
L126607 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
L126606 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Carson Dyle didn't have a brother.
L126605 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ I don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.
L126604 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ It's a start, anyway.
L126603 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ What do I have to do to satisfy you -- become the next victim?
L126602 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Are you trying to say that I might have killed Charles and Scobie?
L126601 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
L126600 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ No -- not yet.
L126599 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ How can I believe it when you don't even know who the killer is? I've got that right, haven't I? You don't know who did it.
L126598 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.
L126597 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
L126596 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes.
L126583 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I don't believe it.
L126582 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
L126581 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ How often do you go through this little ritual?
L126580 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.
L126577 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ I don't think I know that one.
L126576 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Shut the door!
L126575 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
L126574 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on?  What a nut.
L126573 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ What are you doing?
L126572 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I dare you.
L126571 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Then I suggest you call one of them.
L126570 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
L126569 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Reggie -- open the door.
L126568 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ The shower's in there.
L126567 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
L126566 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Got you.
L126555 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches.
L126554 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
L126552 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ No --
L126551 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ What? Assassinate somebody?
L126550 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
L126549 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Yes, I know.
L126548 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
L126547 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
L126546 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed.
L126545 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you.
L126544 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I'm scared.
L126543 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Hm?
L126542 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Alex --
L126541 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ No sense messing up the streets.
L126540 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L126539 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ I'd love some, thanks.
L126538 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ No -- Gene Kelly. Remember the way he danced down there next to the river in 'American in Paris' -- without a care in the world? This is good, want some?
L126537 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ What -- like Scobie?
L126536 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
L126535 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Who?
L126534 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
L126533 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon.
L126532 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ What's so illogical about that?
L126531 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
L126530 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
L126529 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Why?
L126528 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I think Tex did it.
L126526 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ You're a big help. Can I have one of those?
L126525 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Maybe.
L126524 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Or Tex?
L126523 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Maybe.
L126522 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Who do you think did it -- Gideon?
L126495 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ No.
L126494 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
L126457 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to have a treasure hunt.
L126456 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
L126455 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
L126454 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote?
L126427 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
L126426 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.
L126415 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ I don't know -- it depends on whether or not they've already eaten.
L126414 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
L126413 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Tuesday.
L126412 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ What day is it?
L126410 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I'll be right there.
L126409 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ That sounds like their problem.
L126408 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ They've got Jean-Louis!
L126403 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Whoever it is won't give up -- and neither will I.
L126402 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ The phone's ringing --
L126401 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I think I love you, Alex --
L126400 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
L126399 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Oh. 
L126398 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ But I'm not through complaining yet.
L126397 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ You did.
L126396 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Who told you to do that?
L126395 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Cutting it out.
L126394 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ What are you doing?
L126393 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Okay.
L126392 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
L126391 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll just sit around all day long being frivolous -- how about that?
L126390 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
L126389 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Said what?
L126388 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ There, you said it.
L126387 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Why can't you be serious?
L126386 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
L126385 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I'm not fifteen.
L126384 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
L126383 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
L126382 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Reggie -- listen to me --
L126381 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
L126379 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Come here.
L126378 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Whitefoot, of course.
L126377 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Which one are you?
L126376 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Why not a lying Blackfoot?
L126375 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
L126374 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Because he's wearing moccasins.
L126373 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
L126372 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
L126371 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ There must be some way.
L126370 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ You can't.
L126369 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
L126368 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the truth, but I had to find out your part in all this.
L126367 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ There -- you're a new man.
L126366 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ I'm no easier to live with than he was.
L126365 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I thought that was Peter Joshua.
L126364 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Yes, but we're divorced.
L126363 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
L126362 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Alexander.
L126361 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
L126360 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
L126359 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Sure.
L126358 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
L126357 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
L126356 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Would you like to see my passport?
L126355 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
L126354 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
L126353 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Does it hurt?
L126352 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ It's not so bad. You may not be able to lie on your back for a few days -- but, then, you can lie from any position, can't you?
L126351 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Listen -- all I really want is an estimate.
L126349 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Come on -- I've got something that stings like crazy.
L126348 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ I left him hanging around the American Express.
L126347 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Scobie?
L126346 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ I met a man with sharp nails.
L126345 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?
L126312 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ How can I? You lied to me -- the way Charles did -- and after promising you wouldn't. Oh, I want to believe you, Peter... oh, but I can't call you that anymore, can I? It will take me a while to get used to your new name -- which I don't even know yet. What is it?  Aren't you going to tell me?  Hello -- ?
L126311 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
L126310 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Your --
L126309 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Yes, he is. He was my brother.
L126308 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Carson Dyle is dead.

L126306 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
L126305 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
L126304 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Why you lied to me.
L126303 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
L126302 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ It's the only name I've got. How about you?

L126300 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Good morning, Mr. Dyle.
L126830 +++$+++ u4416 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ FÉLIX +++$+++ No. For a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough.
L126829 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I'm -- I'm sorry.
L126828 +++$+++ u4416 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ FÉLIX +++$+++ I am a tradesman, Madame, not a doorman. And don't forget these.

L126826 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Here's ten.
L126825 +++$+++ u4416 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ FÉLIX +++$+++ Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.

L126823 +++$+++ u4416 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ FÉLIX +++$+++ The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.

L126821 +++$+++ u4416 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ FÉLIX +++$+++ A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.

L126816 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ What's its value today?
L126815 +++$+++ u4416 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ FÉLIX +++$+++ It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
L126814 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one?
