L234485 +++$+++ u5497 +++$+++ m366 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ You do what he says, Harold.
L234483 +++$+++ u5500 +++$+++ m366 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ That's good. That's very good. Now Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford, check the oil and tires, we don't want any problems on the road. One more thing... If anybody but you comes back...

L234473 +++$+++ u5500 +++$+++ m366 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ What's the damage?
L235482 +++$+++ u5504 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
L235481 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You knew what I'd do.
L235477 +++$+++ u5504 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ 'Good.'
L235476 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What did he say?
L235475 +++$+++ u5504 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ Yes. I told him.
L235474 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
L235473 +++$+++ u5504 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ Nothing. What could I do?
L235472 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What did you do?  Albert?
L235471 +++$+++ u5504 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
L235470 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Do you want to be dead, Albert?
L235468 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ And you told Brumby?
L235467 +++$+++ u5504 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
L235466 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Who?
L235465 +++$+++ u5504 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
L235464 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ How?
L235463 +++$+++ u5504 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ A couple of weeks back.
L235462 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ When did you find out?
L235461 +++$+++ u5504 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
L235460 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ How?
L235459 +++$+++ u5504 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ Yes.
L235458 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Did Eric Pake pull her?
L235457 +++$+++ u5504 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird.
L235455 +++$+++ u5504 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ I know.
L235454 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You can't get away from me, Albert.
L235451 +++$+++ u5504 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ I know. I know.
L235450 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
L235449 +++$+++ u5504 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ Hello, Jack,  I don't know anything, Jack.
L235101 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Was he?
L235100 +++$+++ u5505 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
L235099 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ How'd it happen, then?
L235098 +++$+++ u5505 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
L235097 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What about the brakes?
L235096 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Was the steering faulty?
L235095 +++$+++ u5505 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Well, he drove it into the river.
L235094 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Yeah.
L235093 +++$+++ u5505 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Oh ay?
L235092 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ This is my brother's car.
L235091 +++$+++ u5505 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ What's it got to do with you?
L235090 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What happened to this car?
L235089 +++$+++ u5505 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ What do you want?
L235504 +++$+++ u5506 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ BRUMBY +++$+++ I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.
L235503 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
L235402 +++$+++ u5506 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ BRUMBY +++$+++ Jack...
L235401 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
L235400 +++$+++ u5506 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ BRUMBY +++$+++ Jack, you're wrong.
L235399 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
L235398 +++$+++ u5506 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ BRUMBY +++$+++ Christ, what...
L235397 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ That's not good enough.
L235396 +++$+++ u5506 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ BRUMBY +++$+++ I don't know. That's all I was told.
L235395 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Why?
L235394 +++$+++ u5506 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ BRUMBY +++$+++ I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
L235393 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Why?
L235392 +++$+++ u5506 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ BRUMBY +++$+++ Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.  Kinnear did it.
L235391 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What name?
L235390 +++$+++ u5506 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ BRUMBY +++$+++ Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you.
L235389 +++$+++ u5506 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ BRUMBY +++$+++ Last night, after you'd gone, I did a little bit of asking around. Seeing as you weren't very forthcoming,  It seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother?  I got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke I wanted off my back,  You know my life. Machines. The arcades. Nice business. Looks after itself. People put money in. I take it out. Not much rough stuff. It's a business that makes me very happy. But recently, I've had a spot of bother,  One of my lads gets a bit over- anxious and flogs some machines in a club that's already got some. The upshot is I've had to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs.  So far as I'm concerned, that's it. Apparently not. These people I've offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit,  So I'm worried. I can't fight them — I haven't that kind of set-up. But I've got to fix them before they fix me. Trouble is, if I try and they find out, I'm dead.
L235388 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Yes.
L235387 +++$+++ u5506 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ BRUMBY +++$+++ A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant.  Do you like it?
L235251 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full- time job. Now behave yourself.
L235250 +++$+++ u5506 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ BRUMBY +++$+++ Bloody well tell me who sent you.
L235246 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Never mind.
L235245 +++$+++ u5506 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ BRUMBY +++$+++ What about?
L235244 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I made a mistake.
L235243 +++$+++ u5506 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ BRUMBY +++$+++ What?
L235242 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I made a mistake.
L235238 +++$+++ u5506 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ BRUMBY +++$+++ Well?
L235237 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I know.
L235236 +++$+++ u5506 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ BRUMBY +++$+++ You know what the bloody time is!  It's two o'clock in the bloody morning!
L235210 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You must be joking,  Keep him away from the telephone. I'm going out for a bit.
L235209 +++$+++ u5521 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ THORPE +++$+++ Can I go now?
L235205 +++$+++ u5521 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ THORPE +++$+++ On the Durham Road. The Pantiles.
L235204 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Address?
L235203 +++$+++ u5521 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ THORPE +++$+++ He's got a new place at Burnham.
L235202 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Where's he living these days?
L235194 +++$+++ u5521 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ THORPE +++$+++ Brumby!
L235193 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Who sent you, Thorpey?
L235192 +++$+++ u5521 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ THORPE +++$+++ No, don't Jack, don't.
L235191 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Yes you can.
L235190 +++$+++ u5521 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ THORPE +++$+++ I can't Jack. How can I?
L235189 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Who paid you to see me off?
L235160 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Oh, really. You're getting very optimistic in your old age, aren't you, Thorpey?
L235159 +++$+++ u5521 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ THORPE +++$+++ I've been asked to make sure you don't.
L235158 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
L235157 +++$+++ u5521 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ THORPE +++$+++ Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time.
L235155 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You stay in the car. I'll come and listen.  What you want to tell me, Thorpey?
L235154 +++$+++ u5521 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ THORPE +++$+++ Confidential, like.
L235153 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ That's nice.
L235152 +++$+++ u5521 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ THORPE +++$+++ I'd like a word with you, Jack.
L235151 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Good evening.
L235150 +++$+++ u5521 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ THORPE +++$+++ Jack?
L235365 +++$+++ u5518 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ MARGARET +++$+++ I don't know nothing.
L235364 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?
L235363 +++$+++ u5518 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ MARGARET +++$+++ It is. Honestly.
L235362 +++$+++ u5518 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ MARGARET +++$+++ It's the truth.
L235361 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?
L235360 +++$+++ u5518 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ MARGARET +++$+++ He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both!  He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street,  I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday.  He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do.
L235359 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What was bugging Frank?
L235358 +++$+++ u5518 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ MARGARET +++$+++ Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
L235357 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Once a week you like a gentleman?
L235356 +++$+++ u5518 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ MARGARET +++$+++ He was gentlemanly. I like that.
L235355 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I call that regular.
L235354 +++$+++ u5518 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ MARGARET +++$+++ Once a week?
L235353 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Why'd you see him so regular?
L235352 +++$+++ u5518 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ MARGARET +++$+++ Yes. I can't help the way I am.
L235351 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Though nicer than most?
L235350 +++$+++ u5518 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ MARGARET +++$+++ Yes.
L235349 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
L235348 +++$+++ u5518 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ MARGARET +++$+++ Nicer than most.
L235347 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Nothing more? Just another feller?
L235346 +++$+++ u5518 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ MARGARET +++$+++ He was all right to me.
L235345 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ How were things between you and Frank?
L234932 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Tomorrow morning, then?
L234931 +++$+++ u5518 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ MARGARET +++$+++ I can't.
L234930 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I want to talk to you later.
L234929 +++$+++ u5518 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ MARGARET +++$+++ I must go. I'm in a hurry.
L234928 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Really.
L234927 +++$+++ u5518 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ MARGARET +++$+++ Killed?  I don't know anything about it.
L234926 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Hold it!   Hold it!  Who killed Frank, Margaret?
L234925 +++$+++ u5518 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ MARGARET +++$+++ No. No. It's not like that. I've got a husband, you know.
L234924 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
L234923 +++$+++ u5518 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ MARGARET +++$+++ She's nothing to do with me.
L234922 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Doreen.
L234921 +++$+++ u5518 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ MARGARET +++$+++ What about?
L234920 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Fine...  I want to talk to you.
L234919 +++$+++ u5518 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ MARGARET +++$+++ Everyhing go off all right?
L235442 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Well, it's Carter. That's my name,  And her father was my brother. And he was murdered last Sunday. Now get up and get dressed.
L235441 +++$+++ u5514 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ GLENDA +++$+++ No.
L235440 +++$+++ u5507 +++$+++ m367 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ And you didn't know her last name?
