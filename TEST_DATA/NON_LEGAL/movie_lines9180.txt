L313844 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
L313843 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
L313842 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What if he checks it?
L313841 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ In the bag underneath.
L313840 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Where's the rest of it?
L313839 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
L313838 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
L313837 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
L313836 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ It'll be more than that.
L313834 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ All he needed was a reasonable explanation.
L313833 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
L313832 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
L313831 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Do you think they bought it?
L313830 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
L313677 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.
L313676 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You're rationalizing.
L313654 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money.
L313653 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ The feds. It's evidence.
L313627 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ What if I've figured a way?
L313626 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...
L313625 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I believe I said I'd be tempted.
L313624 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
L313623 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Which one?
L313622 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I'm not sure you answered my question.
L313621 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ More or less.
L313620 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ And is that it?
L313619 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
L313618 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Did you do it that night?
L313617 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ That's my job.
L313616 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You do that?
L313615 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
L313614 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ What do you do when he comes home?
L313613 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
L313612 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Got another gun and a stun gun...
L313609 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L313608 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
L313607 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
L313606 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ The day you got me out of jail?
L313605 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman.
L313604 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ It's been a long time coming. I finally made up my mind -- I guess it was Thursday.
L313603 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ When did you decide?
L313602 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
L313601 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Why?
L313600 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.
L313599 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
L313598 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You're avoiding the question.
L313597 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
L313596 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
L313595 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
L313594 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
L313593 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
L313592 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ What about you Max?
L313591 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
L313590 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ He tries to act cool.
L313589 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?
L313588 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
L313587 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You know some interesting people.
L313586 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
L313585 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Has he hinted around?
L313584 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
L313583 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I see.
L313582 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ He's setting me up to make a proposition.
L313581 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?
L313580 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
L313579 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You think he's got a thing for you?
L313578 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
L313577 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I called you last night.
L313576 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
L313575 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ He was here?
L313574 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
L313573 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Will Ordell go for that?
L313572 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Sit down, leave the bag under the table?
L313571 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Right around here, in the food court.
L313570 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
L313569 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
L313568 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You don't actually do it that way?
L313567 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
L313566 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Bring the money in and they follow it?
L313565 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ They seem to like the idea.
L313564 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You talk them into it?
L313563 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I go back to work tomorrow.
L313562 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What're you, a bag lady?
L313561 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I don't care.
L313560 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ How old's Annette?
L313559 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm old enough to be her father.
L313558 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Why?
L313557 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ She's adorable. But I had to end it.
L313556 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
L313555 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Sandra Bullock. You know her?
L313554 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Who was your girl before Annette?
L313552 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ For now. These relationships never last too long.
L313551 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ And Annette's it for you?
L313550 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
L313549 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Does it happen to all men?
L313546 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ No...  ...I don't believe she's ever heard of me. But that doesn't mean we're not going steady.
L313545 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Oh, are you? Does she know that?
L313544 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
L313543 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ How was it?
L313542 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ "American President"
L313541 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ What'd ya see?
L313540 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Catching a movie.
L313539 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
L313538 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I walked right past you.
L313537 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Surprise.
L313536 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Well, hello.
L313326 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.
L313325 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Fifteen thousand.
L313324 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
L313323 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Does something else worry you?
L313321 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L313320 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Bigger?
L313319 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ My ass ain't the same.
L313317 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.
L313316 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ It's different with men.
L313315 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
L313314 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ How'd you feel about it?
L313313 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.
L313312 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Really?
L313311 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ It's not really something I think about.
L313310 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
L313309 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You're not old. You look great.
L313308 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ How do you feel about getting old?
L313307 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.
L313306 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
L313305 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
L313304 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You're gonna offer to set him up?
L313303 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
L313302 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ How do you get it out?
L313300 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
L313299 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
L313298 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Why?
L313297 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
L313296 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ We talked.
L313295 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What?... What'd you do?
L313294 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ He came by.
L313293 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ He called you?
L313292 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ He told me last night.
L313291 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ How'd you find that out?
L313290 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
L313289 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
L313288 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
L313287 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
L313286 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
L313285 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Are you?
L313284 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
L313283 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ It's nice.
L313282 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ '74, I think.
L313281 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ '76?
L313280 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ The Delfonics.
L313279 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Who is this?
L313278 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L313277 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ This is pretty.
L313274 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records.
L313273 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You never got into the whole CD revolution?
L313272 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ It looks nice.
L313271 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.
L313270 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Sure.
L313269 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Want to hear some music?
L313268 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L313267 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Somebody loan it to you?
L313265 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You went out this morning and bought a gun.
L313264 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ What, I couldn't hear you?
L313263 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You went out this morning and bought a gun?
L313262 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Thanks, but I have my own now.
L313260 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Black's fine.
L313259 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
L313258 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You get a chance to use it?
L313257 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I am. Have a seat.
L313256 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ If you're having some.
L313185 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
L313184 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What'dya think?
L313183 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?
L313182 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
L313181 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
L313180 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Yeah, if I cooperate.
L313179 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
L313178 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer.
L313177 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?
L313176 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
L313175 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Cash poor?
L313174 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
L313173 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ He's got that kinda money?
L313172 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ With ten thousand? Nine.
L313171 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ How many trips did you make?
L313170 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.
L313169 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.
L313168 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ 'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
L313167 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ It was the other guy who busted me.
L313166 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ He's the one who wants you.
L313165 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
L313164 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ No, you didn't. What branch?
L313163 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I didn't?
L313162 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.
L313161 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
L313160 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Same as you. Ten thousand.
L313159 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Ordell pick up his bond?
L313158 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
L313157 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ That's him. How do you know 'em?
L313156 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ That would be Beaumont Livingston.
L313153 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.
