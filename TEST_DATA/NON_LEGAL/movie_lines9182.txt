L313777 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ How long you been with Ordell?
L313775 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Gimme one anyway.
L313774 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Uh-uh.
L313773 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
L313772 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Killian's.
L313766 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Great...  ...Wanda!
L313765 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Sure.
L313763 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Well, I guess I better look for another one, then. Thanks, anyway.
L313762 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
L313761 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I'm waiting for the phone.
L313760 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Buy ya a beer?
L313759 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Oh, hi.
L313753 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.
L313752 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
L313751 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
L313750 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you.
L313749 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
L313748 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Well, I've been trusting you all this time, haven't I? We agreed on ten percent of what you bring in and that's what you gonna get.
L313747 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
L313746 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
L313745 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
L313744 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Who's paging you?
L313742 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ I'm gonna be sittin' at the titty bar In downtown L.A. till my man over here calls me and gives me the O.K. sign.
L313741 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Where you gonna be during all this?
L313740 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ So you come out with her Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda. Simone peeks out, waits for my man Louis here to give her a signal nobody's watchin'. She leaves the store, gets in her car -- mission accomplished.
L313737 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.
L313736 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
L313735 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Designer clothes.
L313734 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
L313733 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
L313732 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ No, you gonna give her a Robinson's/May bag this time?
L313729 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ I told her this is a game us rich folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a scavenger hunt. She didn't know what that was neither.  No answer?
L313728 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ What does she think she's gettin?
L313727 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ She don't know shit about the money.
L313726 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Are you sure she don't know about the money?
L313725 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
L313724 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
L313723 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Man, I don't like that part.
L313722 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.
L313718 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Not when it's my ass on the line you don't. We do this my way or fuck it.
L313717 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
L313716 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
L313715 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
L313714 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I was there, I saw her do it.
L313713 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ How do you know she did that?
L313712 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
L313711 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ What the hell you talkin' bout?
L313710 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
L313709 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I need to talk to you alone.
L313708 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Drink?
L313533 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool, I promise.
L313532 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
L313531 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ What'd you care?
L313530 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Who?
L313529 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L313528 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
L313523 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ I can do that.
L313522 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Plus the same deal as before.
L313521 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ I'll give ya ten.
L313520 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
L313519 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Managers get ten percent.
L313518 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
L313517 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
L313516 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
L313515 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
L313514 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
L313513 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
L313512 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Can you cover that?
L313511 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ So we need two people, two women.
L313510 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ That's the idea.
L313509 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
L313508 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ No, I give it to someone else first.
L313507 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ But you don't?
L313506 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...
L313505 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Yeah, I think a woman.
L313504 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ If you want.
L313503 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ A woman.
L313502 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I don't know. One of your friends.
L313501 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Who?
L313500 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.
L313499 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ That's a good idea.
L313498 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is.
L313497 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
L313496 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ ...I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill.
L313472 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ What did they say?
L313471 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
L313470 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ What the fuck's that got to do with it?
L313469 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ It's true, isn't it?
L313468 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ You told them that?
L313467 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
L313466 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Didja tell 'em anything else?
L313465 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
L313464 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
L313463 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ They already know it's you.
L313462 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ You told em? You told em it's me?
L313458 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I told them.
L313457 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ How the fuck they know that?
L313456 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you.
L313455 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?
L313454 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I do okay.
L313453 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ I bet you come here on a Saturday night, you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass.
L313390 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ It's a cockatoo.
L313389 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
L313388 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
L313387 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
L313386 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ The Cockatoo Inn.
L313253 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Talk to you tomorrow.
L313252 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
L313251 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea.
L313250 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Yeah.
L313249 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ All your money's in Mexico.
L313248 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ I got a problem...
L313247 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.
L313246 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Yeah?
L313245 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ It's okay. I forgive you. Now, let's say if I tell on you, I walk. And if I don't, I go to jail.
L313244 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Baby, I didn't --
L313243 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.
L313241 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Way I see it, me and you only got one thing to talk about. What you willing to do for me?
L313240 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ I just came here to talk.
L313236 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.
L313235 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how they do.
L313234 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Go sit over in that chair.
L313233 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ I understand woman, damn!
L313232 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I said, you understand what I'm saying
L313231 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
L313230 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
L313229 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
L313228 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
L313227 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much.
L313226 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
L313225 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ What the hell you doin'?
L313224 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You thought right... Now take your hands from around my throat, nigga.
L313223 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
L313222 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ What do you think it is?
L313216 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ They told me.
L313215 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ This fella Beaumont, they say what happened to him?
L313211 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I didn't tell 'em anything.
L313210 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Yeah?
L313209 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.
L313208 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ I knew it.
L313207 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Beaumont Livingston.
L313205 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ You positive about that? You weren't nervous and let something slip by mistake? If you did, I ain't mad, I just gotta know.
L313204 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
L313203 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ And what was your answer?
L313202 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ They asked.
L313201 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too.
L313198 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
L313197 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
L313196 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Who you think got your ass outta jail?
L313195 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ For what?
L313193 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Sure.
L313192 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?
L313191 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L313190 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Got some o.j.?
L313189 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I got some vodka in the freezer.
L313187 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I was expecting you. Come in.
