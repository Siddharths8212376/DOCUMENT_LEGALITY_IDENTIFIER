L516978 +++$+++ u7695 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You don't believe in God anymore.
L516874 +++$+++ u7700 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MAPLES +++$+++ Oh, in a heartbeat.
L516873 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ And your evaluation of the defendant?  Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?
L516872 +++$+++ u7700 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MAPLES +++$+++ What else?  I had the boy teach me kendo.  Including...the importance of the bow.
L516871 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Well, what then, sergeant?
L516860 +++$+++ u7700 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MAPLES +++$+++ More than eager.  He was out to make a point.
L516859 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
L516858 +++$+++ u7700 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MAPLES +++$+++ It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
L516857 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
L516856 +++$+++ u7700 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MAPLES +++$+++ They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir.
L516796 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Pretty darn clear.
L516795 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
L516794 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
L516793 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  With that last one.  Would those cleats have lined up?
L516792 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Found on Carl's boat, too.  Starboard side, second cleat from the stern. But it doesn't match Carl's lines. It matches Miyamoto's.  perfect.
L516791 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ And the last...?
L516790 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
L516789 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ And the next one...?
L516788 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ ...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side.  And it's brand new.  Unlike the rest.
L516361 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ These are fishermen, Alvin.  They don't talk at all to each other and less to me.  Specially gossip.
L516360 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ So, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two.
L516349 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.
L516348 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.
L516429 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ Japanese stick-fighting.  They're trained as kids, y'know.  To kill with sticks.
L516428 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
L516427 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war.  I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times.  Looked exactly like this one.
L516426 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ And why.  Is that?
L516425 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun- butt.  A right-handed fella, to be precise.
L516424 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Did you say more?
L516423 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ He said, 'Could it be somebody hit him?'  And I said, 'You want to play Sherlock Holmes, here?'
L516422 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ ...so when the sheriff returned, you showed him the injury to the deceased's head.
L517286 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Tht was summation, Your H...
L517285 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Your Honor, <u>all</u> of this is speculation.  Including Mr. Hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call.
L517154 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Objection!
L517153 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ You're a hard man to trust, sir. You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f...
L516592 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ All right.  What did your son <u>say</u> to that effect?
L516591 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Objection.  Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.
L516384 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ My gosh, Alvin, was I supposed to object every time you did that?
L516383 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Objection, asking the witness to speculate.
L516382 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a <u>single</u> overturned <u>cup</u> in its wake?
L517353 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ No, sir, I can't.  Not beyond a reasonable doubt.
L517352 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ <u>Were</u> you, sir?  Can you <u>prove</u> one word of all your fancy story?
L517351 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
L517350 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
L517340 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ That's how journalists.  Answer questions.
L517339 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...
L517337 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ He didn't want to lose any more.
L517336 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Greedy.
L517332 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Like you couldn't believe.
L517331 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Your line of work.  You must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth.
L517328 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Oh, yes.
L517327 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
L517326 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed.
L517324 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
L517323 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
L517321 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Twelve.
L517320 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Well, the freighter.  The twine. The blood.  The knife.  The cup. The watch.  The second battery. The phantom lantern.  The fishing gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's <u>eleven</u> things...
L517319 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
L517318 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ <u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
L517284 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Objection!  Speculation.
L517283 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Maybe it went.  Where Carl went. Over the side.
L516612 +++$+++ u7703 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ OLE +++$+++ He said he didn't want that life no more.  He'd been saving to buy a farm.  He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place.
L516611 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ But Carl was a fisherman.  And successful at it.
L516610 +++$+++ u7703 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ OLE +++$+++ Carl Heine came.
L516609 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
L516608 +++$+++ u7703 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ OLE +++$+++ Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
L516607 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Mr. Jurgensen.  Did he offer to <u>buy</u> the seven acres from you?
L516606 +++$+++ u7703 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ OLE +++$+++ Oh, yeh.  He said someday he would get his land back.
L516605 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Robbed.  He was angry.
L517150 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ I had a spare battery in my shed. I brought it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up.
L517149 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Well, the sheriff found <u>two</u> batteries in your well.  If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible?
L517148 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ Yes.
L517147 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
L517146 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
L517145 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.
L517144 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ You mean, this morning.  The new story, the battery story. That one is the truth?  That's a question, sir.
L517143 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ I have told the truth.
L517142 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth?
L517140 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the <u>truth</u>.
L517139 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ I should have told everything right away.  I know that now, and I regret it.
L517138 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir.  You'd <u>been</u> arrested, you <u>had</u> a lawyer, and you <u>still</u> claimed ignorance!
L517137 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ Yes.  Initially.
L517136 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ But even <u>after</u> you had an attorney.  You still claimed to know <u>nothing</u>.  Claimed <u>not</u> to have seen Carl. Am I correct?
L517135 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ Sheriff said right off, I was under suspicion.  I didn't have a lawyer...
L517131 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Actually, she said you had decided. Decided <u>not</u> not come forward.
L517130 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ As my wife testified, we were considering it.
L516952 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  No one knows.
L516951 +++$+++ u7699 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ LEVANT +++$+++ They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery.
L516950 +++$+++ u7699 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ LEVANT +++$+++ No, night of the 16th, morning the 17th.  We replaced two guys named Miller and Milholland.
L516949 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ You mean, early morning the 16th?
L516948 +++$+++ u7699 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ LEVANT +++$+++ Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.
L516947 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ How long you have this detail?
L516932 +++$+++ u7699 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ LEVANT +++$+++ Shorthard the radio transmis- sions, write 'em up, file 'em in a cabinet.  Nobody ever looks. Just take up space.
L516931 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ And you keep the records, or contribute to 'em.
L516930 +++$+++ u7699 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ LEVANT +++$+++ Since September.  Last guys got transferred.
L516929 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ You have the night watch?  On the radio.
L517240 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
L517239 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...
L517235 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ You're right.  I better use two.
L517234 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ You gonna climb that with one arm?
L517232 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Have a look.  At nothing.
L517231 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Here now, what are you fixin' to do?
L517223 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ It's public record.  If the public cares enough to read it.
L517222 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place.
L517206 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Won't take two.
L517205 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ You said three minutes.
L516367 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Three kids.  What's she going to do?
L516366 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ I did.  Boy.
L517377 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point.
L517376 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ We don't let go, you s...
L517368 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Naw, I've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes.
L517367 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ You ever been strangled by a single hand?
L517366 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ If I whistle.  Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'.  <u>You're</u> the story today.
L517364 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ I'll take two.  One for later.
L517363 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Cigarette?
L517312 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Well, anything coulda caused that.
L517311 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
L517310 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ You think so?
L517309 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ He hit his head.  On the way in.
L517308 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Still and all.  Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
L517307 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ The freighter started through at 1:42.  The sea water seeped into Carl's watch and stopped it. At 1:47.
L517306 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Still a coincidence.  Timing and all.
L517299 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ The knife.  What knife?
L517298 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
L517297 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
L517296 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
L517295 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Maybe...?
L517294 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
L517293 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
L517292 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
L517291 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Still lashed to the mast.
L517290 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.  Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing.  But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...
L517289 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Fell.
L517288 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ That's when he fell.
L517281 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Because the second lantern, the one on the mast.  Was never found.  So we have to ask...
L517280 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Well, why does it?
L517279 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
L517278 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Now you believe there were <u>two</u> lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand.  The second lashed to the mast.
L517277 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Well.  It shows the prosecutor was wrong.  It was <u>Carl's</u> boat that was dead in the water.  Or he'd never have put up the lantern.
L517276 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Tell us why that lantern would be so significant.
L517271 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ To my father.  Everything counts.
L517270 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ He's looking down.  And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday.  He's proud of the man you are tonight.  That's what counts.
L517269 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Yes, he was.
L517268 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.
L517267 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ I'm wondering how the judge is gonna like my waking up his old bones.  in the middle of the night.
L517266 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ You're wondering why I held it.
L517265 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ This tastes horrible, hmmn?
L517262 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ No, you don't.
L517261 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ It's the way it happened, I know it is.
L516819 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Look, no way I'm lettin' you out there.  In a half hour you could be in Canada.
L516818 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ Sheriff, I can't afford not to fish toni...
L516816 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ Sure.  Blood gets all <u>over</u> your hand, Sheriff, ask any fisherman.
L516815 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ You gaff with the <u>hook</u> end. Blood's on the butt.  Where your hand goes.
L516810 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Sure you did.  Help me with this hold cover, willya?
L516809 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ Naw, I had that around for a while.
L516808 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.
L516805 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ I was checking the cables.
L516804 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ You always run with the well open?
L516800 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ We have a warrant.  To search your boat.
L516799 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ What for, Sheriff?
L517103 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ And what do you believe?
L517102 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.
L517101 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ You think that <u>is</u> the truth.
L517100 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ I want you.  To tell the truth.
L517099 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ You want me to say that.
L517096 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
L517095 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.
L517092 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said.
L517091 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ And what's that?
L516660 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ I should show them an American?
L516659 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ So every time you think about showing that jury strength.  Or honor or composure.  Or dignity.
L516657 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ Mr. Gudmundsson, we <u>know</u> what that jury is looking at.
L516656 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth...
L516643 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ You're wonderin'...how come I never ask.  If you did it.
L516642 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ You wouldn't even see it move.
L516641 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ Sure.  I could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. Right above your left ear.
L516640 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Bet there's a few things you could teach me.  Kendo, for one.
L516638 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ I think you like learning.
L516637 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ You must think I like losing.
L516635 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ You mean, do I like to take the offensive?  Or hang back and wait.
L516634 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ White or black?
L516632 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Your daddy played.  I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?
L516631 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ What makes you think I play?
L516831 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ <u>You</u> said that.  That was <u>your</u> testimony.
L516830 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
L516829 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ What else could it be?
L516828 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
L516827 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
L516825 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ The damage was considerable. But she's insured.  Thanks, again.
L516824 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ And her farmhouse...?
L516823 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
L516822 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ How <u>is</u> your mother-in-law?
L516421 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Possible.  But not darn likely.
L516420 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>.  Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible?
L516419 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ You don't.  <u>Remember</u>.
L516418 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
L516417 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
L516416 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ I don't think so.
L516415 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?
L516414 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
