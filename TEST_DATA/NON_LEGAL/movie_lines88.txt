L97687 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
L97686 +++$+++ u572 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ F.B.I. MAN +++$+++ We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
L97685 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
L97684 +++$+++ u572 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ F.B.I. MAN +++$+++ You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
L97683 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
L97682 +++$+++ u572 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ F.B.I. MAN +++$+++ We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
L97512 +++$+++ u573 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!
L97511 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yes.
L97510 +++$+++ u573 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. Straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
L97495 +++$+++ u573 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.  You like me?
L97494 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Nothing.
L97493 +++$+++ u573 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What are you lookin' at?
L97485 +++$+++ u573 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back. 
L97484 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ What?
L97483 +++$+++ u573 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Hey? You like to walk.
L97470 +++$+++ u573 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Do you see, Ben? I can make him do anything I fuckin' please.
L97469 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Here's to Ben.
L97468 +++$+++ u573 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.

L97431 +++$+++ u573 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Go where?
L97430 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I don't want to go.
L97429 +++$+++ u573 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No thanks. What does that mean?
L97428 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ No thanks.

L97144 +++$+++ u577 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ MRS. BEAUMONT +++$+++ You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
L97143 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Nothing. I'm fine.
L97142 +++$+++ u577 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ MRS. BEAUMONT +++$+++ Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
L97141 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ God, you scared me.
L96985 +++$+++ u577 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ MRS. BEAUMONT +++$+++ Of course, Jeffrey.
L96984 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Can I use the car tonight?
L96825 +++$+++ u577 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ MRS. BEAUMONT +++$+++ Alright.
L96824 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ No, I'm just gonna walk around.
L96823 +++$+++ u577 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ MRS. BEAUMONT +++$+++ Do you want the car?
L96822 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I'm going out for awhile.
L96786 +++$+++ u577 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ MRS. BEAUMONT +++$+++ Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
L96785 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Thanks a lot, Mom.
L96784 +++$+++ u577 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ MRS. BEAUMONT +++$+++ It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
L96783 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ What?
L96782 +++$+++ u577 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ MRS. BEAUMONT +++$+++ He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
L96781 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yeah?
L96780 +++$+++ u577 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ MRS. BEAUMONT +++$+++ Jeffrey, when you see your father.
L96779 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Well. Okay.
L96778 +++$+++ u577 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ MRS. BEAUMONT +++$+++ I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
L96777 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ What time are visiting hours?
L96774 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Be right down.
L96773 +++$+++ u577 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ MRS. BEAUMONT +++$+++ Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
L96764 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ This is it.
L96763 +++$+++ u577 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ MRS. BEAUMONT +++$+++ Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
L96756 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Mom.
L96755 +++$+++ u577 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ MRS. BEAUMONT +++$+++ Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
L96754 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
L96753 +++$+++ u577 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ MRS. BEAUMONT +++$+++ I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
L97630 +++$+++ u578 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ MRS. WILLIAMS +++$+++ I'll get a coat for her.
L97629 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Sandy?... Sandy, please.
L97251 +++$+++ u578 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ MRS. WILLIAMS +++$+++ Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. Just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.
L97250 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
L97249 +++$+++ u578 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ MRS. WILLIAMS +++$+++ Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
L97237 +++$+++ u578 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ MRS. WILLIAMS +++$+++ Anyone else? Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.
L97236 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ That sounds great!
L97235 +++$+++ u578 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ MRS. WILLIAMS +++$+++ Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
L96860 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Say "goodnight" to Sandy.
L96859 +++$+++ u578 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ MRS. WILLIAMS +++$+++ Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
L96858 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.

L96835 +++$+++ u578 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ MRS. WILLIAMS +++$+++ Would you like a piece of cake?
L96834 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yeah, I know.
L96833 +++$+++ u578 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ MRS. WILLIAMS +++$+++ I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
L96832 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Alright.
L96831 +++$+++ u578 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ MRS. WILLIAMS +++$+++ Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
L96830 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
L96829 +++$+++ u578 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ MRS. WILLIAMS +++$+++ Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
L96828 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
L97606 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
L97605 +++$+++ u575 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
L97221 +++$+++ u575 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
L97220 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
L97219 +++$+++ u575 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
L97218 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ No, you're right.
L97217 +++$+++ u575 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.
L97216 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Well.
L97215 +++$+++ u575 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Looks like you'd make a good runner.
L97214 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ No.

L96795 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Hi Dad.
L97694 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.

L97648 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
L97640 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Go ahead!
L97639 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Sandy?

L97613 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
L97612 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Probably not. No. Why?
L97611 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
L97610 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
L97604 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yes.
L97603 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Dorothy Vallens?
L97602 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Dorothy!... Dorothy!
L97595 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Sandy, this guy is a killer!! I promise you.
L97594 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ No.
L97593 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ My father has a gun at home.
L97590 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Frank!!!
L97589 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Oh my God. What's wrong?
L97586 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Okay.
L97585 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ You want to dance?
L97583 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Just a minute.
L97582 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Let's wait for some slow one.
L97581 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ NO.
L97580 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Really. You want to dance with someone else?
L97579 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Really?
L97578 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I can't dance fast.
L97577 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ You want to dance?
L97576 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
L97575 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
L97574 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ You look beautiful.
L97573 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ It's okay.
L97572 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
L97571 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
L97570 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Where to?
L97569 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ It's good to see you.
L97568 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
L97567 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ What was that all about?
L97563 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Just some fatherly advice.
L97562 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ What is it?
L97561 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Okay.
L97554 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Okay. Great!
L97553 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
L97552 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ No.
L97551 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ You didn't tell him about me?
L97550 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
L97549 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Everything okay?
L97525 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Okay, but I promise I won't mention you. Okay? I'll see him at the police station, okay? See you Friday night, if not before.
L97524 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
L97523 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
L97348 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.
L97347 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ You worry about me really?
L97344 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.
L97343 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ You like mysteries that much?
L97342 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
L97341 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Jeffrey? Why?
L97340 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yeah.
L97339 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
L97338 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
L97337 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Jeffrey!!
L97336 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
L97335 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Oh yeah?
L97334 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
L97333 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
L97332 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
L97331 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Shoot.
L97330 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
L97329 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
L97328 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Yeah, but I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
L97327 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ You want to go talk to him?
L97326 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ What am I going to do?
L97325 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I'm really sorry.
L97324 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ You were late.
L97307 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ See ya tomorrow.
L97306 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Goodnight.
L97305 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Okay, okay.
L97304 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ You better not, Jeffrey.
L97303 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Can I give you a kiss good night?
L97302 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Okay, Sandy.
L97301 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Okay, be careful.
L97300 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
L97299 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
L97298 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.
L97297 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
L97296 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
L97295 +++$+++ u580 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.
