L283713 +++$+++ u1361 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ ENDICOTT +++$+++ Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
L283707 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
L283706 +++$+++ u1361 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ ENDICOTT +++$+++ Well, that about covers everything.
L284793 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ I'll have it in a minute.
L284792 +++$+++ u1361 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ ENDICOTT +++$+++ Hold the phone!
L284687 +++$+++ u1361 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ ENDICOTT +++$+++ Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
L284686 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
L284394 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Where is he, before we beat it out of you?
L284393 +++$+++ u1361 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ ENDICOTT +++$+++ Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
L284392 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Come on, you! Before we slap you down.
L284360 +++$+++ u1361 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ ENDICOTT +++$+++ I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both.
L284359 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.
L284354 +++$+++ u1361 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ ENDICOTT +++$+++ Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun.  Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie?
L284353 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are you trying to scoop us or something?
L284107 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Who engineered this getaway?
L284106 +++$+++ u1361 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ ENDICOTT +++$+++ What's the dope, Sheriff?
L284105 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ So have we!
L284043 +++$+++ u1361 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ ENDICOTT +++$+++ Call you back.
L284042 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
L284041 +++$+++ u1361 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ ENDICOTT +++$+++ No, I tell you! Nobody knows where he got it.
L283923 +++$+++ u1361 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ ENDICOTT +++$+++ Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
L283922 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Boy, did you see her go?
L283911 +++$+++ u1361 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ ENDICOTT +++$+++ What's the use? I can't win a pot.
L283910 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ You guys wanna play some more poker?
L283875 +++$+++ u1361 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ ENDICOTT +++$+++ Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
L283874 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ She says she's gonna write fiction.
L283869 +++$+++ u1361 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ ENDICOTT +++$+++ Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
L283868 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.
L283760 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ What have you got, Hildy?
L283759 +++$+++ u1361 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ ENDICOTT +++$+++ Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows up the Sheriff will still be crying 'Wolf!'
L283752 +++$+++ u1361 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ ENDICOTT +++$+++ Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!
L283751 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
L283750 +++$+++ u1361 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ ENDICOTT +++$+++ This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
L283749 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.
L284672 +++$+++ u1361 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ ENDICOTT +++$+++ Probably goin' out to get Williams.
L284671 +++$+++ u1369 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MCCUE +++$+++ We know what you're up to.
L284389 +++$+++ u1361 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ ENDICOTT +++$+++ Now, where is he?
L284388 +++$+++ u1369 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MCCUE +++$+++ You ain't gettin' out o' here!
L284336 +++$+++ u1361 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ ENDICOTT +++$+++ No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back.
L284335 +++$+++ u1369 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MCCUE +++$+++ What a chase!
L284008 +++$+++ u1369 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MCCUE +++$+++ So long, Hildy.
L284007 +++$+++ u1361 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ ENDICOTT +++$+++ Goodbye, Yonson.
L283702 +++$+++ u1361 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ ENDICOTT +++$+++ Three sixes. Is that any good?
L283701 +++$+++ u1369 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MCCUE +++$+++ I'll call.
L283611 +++$+++ u1362 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Good coffee, isn't it?
L283610 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Gus, this --
L283606 +++$+++ u1362 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ That's all right.
L283605 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must have slipped.
L283575 +++$+++ u1362 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Just coffee.  And you, sir?
L283574 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ No -- just coffee, Gus.
L283573 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ I guess so.
L283572 +++$+++ u1362 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Little rum in yours, too?
L283571 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
L283567 +++$+++ u1362 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ I can't complain.
L283566 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ How's everything, Gus?
L284788 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ All right! Carl! Frank! One of you get on each side of the desk. Take hold of the cover.
L284787 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ That's murder!
L284768 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ He can't hurt anybody. You've got his gun.
L284767 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
L284766 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ He's harmless.
L284712 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ With a bag of marshmallows.
L284711 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ What?
L284710 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
L284699 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Not this gun!
L284698 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
L284697 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Where'd you get this?
L284690 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ All right, boys. Take her along. I got ways of making her talk.
L284689 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ What do I know about Williams?
L284688 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?
L284679 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Nobody's trying to put anything over on you. I'm getting out of here and you can't stop me!
L284678 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
L284677 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
L284676 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
L284675 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
L284670 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
L284669 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
L284666 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Hold her, boys!
L284665 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Take your paws off me!
L284662 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Let go o' me. What's the idea?
L284661 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Just a minute, Johnson!
L283865 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ That's awful kind of you, Sheriff. I've got to get started on my interview. See you later.
L283864 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
L283863 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.
L283858 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too.  'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?
L283857 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
L283856 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
L283855 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
L283854 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
L283853 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Same way you did.  Through that gate.
L284111 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.
L284110 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Where is he?
L284054 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --
L284053 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ After all I've done for you --
L284052 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
L284051 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ A fine fair-weather friend you are!
L284050 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
L284049 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ What went off?
L284048 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
L284047 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
L284220 +++$+++ u1373 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ PINKUS +++$+++ That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
L284219 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Just one second --
L284197 +++$+++ u1373 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ PINKUS +++$+++ No, I couldn't do that.
L284196 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.
L284167 +++$+++ u1373 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ PINKUS +++$+++ Yeah. But I --
L284166 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
L284158 +++$+++ u1373 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ PINKUS +++$+++ Earl Williams. The reprieve.
L284157 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ For who?
L284152 +++$+++ u1373 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ PINKUS +++$+++ You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.
L284151 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
L284887 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ So do you what, you hoodoo!  And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.
L284886 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ And so do I!
L284870 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ I was only doing my duty. Nothing personal in it.
L284869 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Walter, I can't tell you how badly I feel about this. There was no excuse for Hartwell to fly off the handle.
L284868 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ I was just going to!
L284867 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
L284853 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ I never saw him before!
L284852 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ That's a lie!!
L284848 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ It's a frame-up! Some imposter!
L284847 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
L284841 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Throw him out, Frank.
L284840 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Who is this man?
L284821 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Well! Looks like about ten years apiece for you birds!
L284820 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
L284819 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ A sight for sore eyes!
L284818 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
L284817 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you.
L284230 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.
L284229 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
L284228 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
L284227 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
L284226 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
L284225 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Shoot to kill, I said.
L284224 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ What?
L284223 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.
L284222 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Just -- one -- second!
L284221 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ We'll fix that, too. 
L284207 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Now what do you say?
L284206 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
L284188 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
L284187 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ No -- don't out me off.
L284180 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Cover up that transmitter!
L284179 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ I did.  Hold the wire.
L284178 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Tell 'em to hold the wire.
L284177 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
L284176 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ What is it?
L284175 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
L284174 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
L284173 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
L284172 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
L284171 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
L284170 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
L284169 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ An attempt to ruin us!
L284168 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Pure politics!
L284161 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you.  Who else knows about this?
L284160 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!
L284146 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away.
L284145 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
L284144 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
L284143 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
L284142 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ We're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'Reform the Reds With a Rope'.
L284141 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ That gives you an idea of what I'm up against!
L284139 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ If there was any way out...
L284138 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
L284137 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
L284136 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
L284135 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
L284134 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Fred!
L284133 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.
L284132 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ What do you mean -- through?
L284131 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Pete, you're through!
L284130 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ If you're talking about my brother- in-law, he's worked for the city fifteen years.
L284129 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic uncles of yours?  Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it?
L284128 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
L284127 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
L284126 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. I'll get results. I'm doing everything humanly possible. I've just sworn in four hundred deputies.
L284116 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Pete, I've got a mighty unpleasant task to perf --
L284115 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
L284114 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Did you actually give Williams that gun?
L284113 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
L284112 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Pete, I want to talk to you!
L284798 +++$+++ u1375 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILLIAMS +++$+++ Go on -- shoot me!
L284797 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Got you, Williams!
L283995 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
L283994 +++$+++ u1375 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILLIAMS +++$+++ I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.
L283862 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
L283861 +++$+++ u1375 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILLIAMS +++$+++ I won't.
L283860 +++$+++ u1363 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HARTMAN +++$+++ That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
L283859 +++$+++ u1375 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILLIAMS +++$+++ Fine, thanks, Sheriff.
L283959 +++$+++ u1365 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ Well, all right. But I'm liable to get into a jam.
L283958 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ You'll take fifty and like it!
L283957 +++$+++ u1365 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ Five hundred dollars.
L283956 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ You can let him out on bail, can't you?
L283955 +++$+++ u1365 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
L283954 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
L283953 +++$+++ u1365 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ I can't.
L283952 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
L283951 +++$+++ u1365 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ Now, Hildy --
L283950 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
L283949 +++$+++ u1365 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
L283948 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Let him out of here, Lieutenant.
