L311027 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Got a couple of kids, huh?
L311026 +++$+++ u1552 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SHAPELEY +++$+++ Orange, New Jersey.
L311025 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Where do you live?
L311022 +++$+++ u1552 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SHAPELEY +++$+++ You can trust me, Mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.
L311021 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah ?—How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
L311020 +++$+++ u1552 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SHAPELEY +++$+++ I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
L311019 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Sh-sh-sh—! Soft pedal, you mug!—before I— What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thing—and you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
L311018 +++$+++ u1552 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SHAPELEY +++$+++ But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with—
L311017 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
L311016 +++$+++ u1552 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SHAPELEY +++$+++ Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, see—and—
L311015 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
L311014 +++$+++ u1552 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SHAPELEY +++$+++ You're not kidnapping her, are you?
L311013 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah—the "big boy"—the Boss of the outfit.
L311010 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ That's all right. I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll let you have one of them.
L311009 +++$+++ u1552 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SHAPELEY +++$+++ Why—no—
L311008 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
L311007 +++$+++ u1552 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SHAPELEY +++$+++ Huh?
L311006 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
L311005 +++$+++ u1552 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SHAPELEY +++$+++ Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to—
L311004 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I can use a smart guy like you.
L311003 +++$+++ u1552 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SHAPELEY +++$+++ You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
L311002 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
L311001 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You're a pretty shrewd baby.  We better get away from this gang. Talk this thing over privately.
L311000 +++$+++ u1552 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SHAPELEY +++$+++ Five G's—or I crab the works.
L310999 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What's on your mind?
L310998 +++$+++ u1552 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SHAPELEY +++$+++ Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see?  A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what I always say.
L310997 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Why?
L310996 +++$+++ u1552 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SHAPELEY +++$+++ I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
L310995 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What?
L310994 +++$+++ u1552 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SHAPELEY +++$+++ It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
L310993 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah—wouldn't it?
L310992 +++$+++ u1552 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SHAPELEY +++$+++ Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
L310991 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ That's right.
L310990 +++$+++ u1552 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SHAPELEY +++$+++ If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
L310989 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Thanks. 
L310988 +++$+++ u1552 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SHAPELEY +++$+++ Travelin' like this, you kinda lose track of what's goin' on in the world.
L310986 +++$+++ u1552 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SHAPELEY +++$+++ Say, Buddy–
L310985 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time. 
L310984 +++$+++ u1552 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SHAPELEY +++$+++ What's up?
L310688 +++$+++ u1552 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SHAPELEY +++$+++ Oh, excuse me.  I was just tryin'—you know—to make things pleasant.
L310687 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah. Come on—come on!
L310686 +++$+++ u1552 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SHAPELEY +++$+++ Wife?
L310685 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'd like to sit with my—uh—wife—if you don't mind. 
L310684 +++$+++ u1552 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SHAPELEY +++$+++ What's the idea?
L310683 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ There's a seat over there for you.
L310682 +++$+++ u1552 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SHAPELEY +++$+++ Huh?
L310681 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Hey, you!
L310680 +++$+++ u1552 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SHAPELEY +++$+++ Well, you're two up on me now. 
L328490 +++$+++ u1555 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.
L328489 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.
L328460 +++$+++ u1555 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ "Threat to assassinate President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, November 22-23.  Information received by the Bureau has determined that a militant revolutionary group may attempt to assassinate President Kennedy on his proposed trip to Dallas, Texas, etc, etc..."
L328459 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ William Walter, the night clerk on duty here in the FBI office, gave me a copy of this.  It went all over the country.  Nothing was done, and the motorcade went ahead on schedule - and this wasn't even mentioned in the Warren Report!  Read it, Al.
L328435 +++$+++ u1555 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ Without them, it's going to be near impossible, chief, to prove Shaw's connection to the CIA.  We got the same problem with the governors. All of them.  Reagan in California won't give us Brading, Ohio refuses Orville Townsend, Texas on Arcacha, and Nebraska on Sandra Moffet.
L328434 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
L328433 +++$+++ u1555 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ The U.S. Attorney in Washington "declines" to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard Helms, or any FBI agent we named.
L328316 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Not one word.  That's an order.
L328315 +++$+++ u1555 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
L328314 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I don't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo, Numa, it's none of our business.  Let's keep this side of it quiet, shall we?
L328228 +++$+++ u1555 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ My instinct is that Ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating, and we'll end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks.  If we call him now, he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot we've ever had.
L328227 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Susie, watch the language, would you please.
L327970 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...
L327969 +++$+++ u1555 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.
L327839 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Al, you can't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close.  Goddamn, Sam!  If we don't start reading between the lines here! Y'all gotta start thinking on a different level - like the CIA does. We're through the looking glass. Here white is black and black is white.
L327838 +++$+++ u1555 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ Boss, Oswald impersonators?  Sounds like James Bond now.
L327895 +++$+++ u1556 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ I don't know how they got to me. Maybe cause I repped him here.  The Feebees run background checks.  On my mama's breasts, man, that's all I got.  There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim.  If there were, why the hell didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General, he was his brother for Chrissake.  How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, I don't know.  It was Oswald.  He was a nut job.  Faggot, y'know, hated this country.
L327894 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
L327893 +++$+++ u1556 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ There were no phone records.
L327892 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
L327891 +++$+++ u1556 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.
L327890 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?
L327889 +++$+++ u1556 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes.  Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.
L327888 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Recall any names?
L327887 +++$+++ u1556 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Three, four.  He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...
L327886 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ So you saw Oswald how many times?
L327885 +++$+++ u1556 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
L327884 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ And Oswald?
L327883 +++$+++ u1556 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
L327882 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Did he pay?
L327881 +++$+++ u1556 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
L327880 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What was his voice like?
L327874 +++$+++ u1556 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Swishes.  They swish, y'know.  Young fags, you know.  They'd come into my bureau needing help, no bread, and I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller, who gonna back you up?  These cornmuffins go to the phone and dial...
L327873 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Street cats?
L327872 +++$+++ u1556 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.
L327871 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ When did you first do business with this Bertrand?
L327870 +++$+++ u1556 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
L327869 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
L327867 +++$+++ u1556 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ They put the heat on, my man, just like you're doing.  I gave'em anything that popped into my cabeza.  Truth is, I never met the dude.
L327866 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
L327865 +++$+++ u1556 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Right.
L327864 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
L327863 +++$+++ u1556 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
L327862 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
L327861 +++$+++ u1556 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
L327533 +++$+++ u1577 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ You know what I mean.  I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer.  And a lotta strange people.
L327532 +++$+++ u1557 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BANISTER +++$+++ I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
L327531 +++$+++ u1577 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
L327530 +++$+++ u1557 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BANISTER +++$+++ You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.  You're a goddamn spy.
L327529 +++$+++ u1577 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid.  I mean, you really are.
L327528 +++$+++ u1557 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BANISTER +++$+++ Who the hell opened my files!  You've been looking through my private files, haven't you, you weasel?
L327527 +++$+++ u1557 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BANISTER +++$+++ I couldn't be more serious, Jack. Those big red eyes have me wondering about your loyalty.
L327526 +++$+++ u1577 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
L327525 +++$+++ u1557 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BANISTER +++$+++ Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
L327524 +++$+++ u1557 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BANISTER +++$+++ Get home my ass.  We're going to the office, have another drink.  I want some company tonight.
L327523 +++$+++ u1577 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
L327522 +++$+++ u1557 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BANISTER +++$+++ Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?  I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
L327513 +++$+++ u1557 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BANISTER +++$+++ Bullshit!  Bartender, another round...  Here's to the New Frontier.  Camelot in smithereens.  I'll drink to that.
L327512 +++$+++ u1577 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
L327511 +++$+++ u1557 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BANISTER +++$+++ A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
L327510 +++$+++ u1577 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
L327509 +++$+++ u1557 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BANISTER +++$+++ All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.
L328472 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie.  You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here!  What the hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw - maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
L328471 +++$+++ u1586 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SUSIE +++$+++ Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
L327998 +++$+++ u1586 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SUSIE +++$+++ No!... Shaw!  Director of The Trade Mart?  This is incredible.
L327997 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
L327996 +++$+++ u1586 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SUSIE +++$+++ Who?
L327796 +++$+++ u1586 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SUSIE +++$+++ You want facts, Bill?  Okay.  From 1945 to '59 only two U.S. soldiers defect to Russia.  From '59 to '60, seven defect, six return, one of them another Marine a month before Oswald.  All of them young men made to seem poor, disenchanted.
L327795 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
L327794 +++$+++ u1586 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SUSIE +++$+++ I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
L327784 +++$+++ u1586 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SUSIE +++$+++ Yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance.  Three years later and he's still classified?  They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald.  Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the Marines at 17.  He learns Russian, he acts overtly Marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights over Russia originate.  He's discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother's sick.  He stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow...
L327783 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Maybe there's more to this, Susie. The CIA's keeping something from our enemies.
L328283 +++$+++ u1563 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yes, you are.  Look we know Oswald didn't pull that trigger.  Castro did.  But if that comes out, there's gonna be a war, boy - millions of people are gonna die.  That's a hell of a lot more important than Jim Garrison.  Goddammit, look at me when I talk to you!  You're too goddamn self- opinionated, now shut up.  If you got a brain in that thick skull of yours, listen to me.  Listen real hard.
L328282 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ No, I'm not...
L328281 +++$+++ u1563 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Who do you think fed him that information?  Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life.  You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.
L328280 +++$+++ u1563 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Senator Long set your boss up, my friend.
L328279 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Frank, I don't want to hear it.
L328278 +++$+++ u1563 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
L328277 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Yeah, I guess you do.
L328276 +++$+++ u1563 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
L328275 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
L328274 +++$+++ u1563 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
L328273 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
L328272 +++$+++ u1563 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Bill.
L328447 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ You're not digging.
L328446 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Keep saying what?
L328445 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ You know you keep saying that.
L328444 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ ...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement.  No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs.  I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw.  He's...
L328443 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Yeah.  They were seen together in Clinton in early September.  The Civil Rights Movement was running a voter registration drive.
L328266 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ With whose testimony?  Willie O'Keefe? A male prostitute.  Jack Martini?  A drunk?  Vernon Bundy?  A dope fiend. Shaw's got respect, the newspaper editors, the American Bar Association - they're not...
L328265 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Not unless we go for Shaw now.
L328264 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ The fact is he's gone, chief, and so's our case.
L328248 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
L328247 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ It's addressed to no one and no signature.  "To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect.  I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome."
L327842 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ You, Numa?
L327841 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.
L327840 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ What do you think, Lou?
L327612 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Pretty fast, wasn't it.  The way they let him go.
L327611 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Correct me if I'm wrong.  I thought we were on the same side.  What the hell business is it of theirs to say that?
L327987 +++$+++ u1580 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MOBSTER +++$+++ Who gives a shit what he calls himself?
L327986 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ So why does he call himself Bertrand?
L327985 +++$+++ u1580 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MOBSTER +++$+++ Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
L327984 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
L327983 +++$+++ u1580 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MOBSTER +++$+++ Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
L327982 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ What's the other name?
L327981 +++$+++ u1580 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MOBSTER +++$+++ I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here.
L327980 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
L327979 +++$+++ u1580 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MOBSTER +++$+++ Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
L327925 +++$+++ u1582 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ O'KEEFE +++$+++ ...well the party got crazier and crazier, one of those, y'know "beatnik" type things.
L327924 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Go on, Willie.
L327923 +++$+++ u1582 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ O'KEEFE +++$+++ Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in jail.  I got no reason to lie to you.  I ain't no nigger.
L327916 +++$+++ u1582 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ O'KEEFE +++$+++ Yeah, strange guy.  Dave introduced him as...
L327915 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
L327914 +++$+++ u1582 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ O'KEEFE +++$+++ ...there were about nine or ten people, Cubans, friends of Dave doing some stuff in the bush with him. Place was a mess.  Dave's mind was a mess,  Y'know he had all those mice cages around cause he's working on this cure for cancer... Dave's smart - real smart - speaks five languages, knows philosophy, medicine, military history, politics.  He wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him 'cause he was queer...
L327911 +++$+++ u1582 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ O'KEEFE +++$+++ Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.
L327910 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Did he pay you for this?
L327907 +++$+++ u1582 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ O'KEEFE +++$+++ Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
L327906 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Clay Bertrand, Willie?
L328484 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ This is Louisiana, chief.  How the hell do you know who your daddy is? 'Cause your momma told you so... You're way out there taking a crap in the wind, boss, and I for one ain't going along on this one.  Jim sighs, saddened.  Bill was one of his best men.
L328483 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Julius Caesar:  "Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men."  Who killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five Senators.  All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA...
L328482 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Yeah.
L328481 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up?  Y'ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?
L328480 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Maybe 'cause there's some rogue element in the Government!
L328479 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices?  Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?  Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?
L328478 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
L328477 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam. That's just for openers.
L328476 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?
L328475 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
L328474 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.
L328473 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Shaw's our toehold, Bill.  I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care.  I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!
L328470 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ There's a word - orders.
L328469 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?
L328271 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I don't know, Bill, I just don't know.
L328270 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Where you going, boss?
L328269 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ All right, all right.  Break it up.
L328257 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.
L328256 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  "When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible.  I offered you love.  All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."
L328224 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Well, they offered you the carrot, and you turned it down... you know what's coming next, don't you, boss?
L328223 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Those bastards!  That's proof enough right there of what we're up against. The whole goddamn Federal Government, Bill!
L328187 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me?
L328186 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ That's fine, Numa, but what about all the people who aren't writing letters.  They're sitting home reading all these lies.  I just heard NBC crew's in town to do a "White Paper" - not on the Kennedy killing, but on us.  One of their top guys, Harry Stoner, is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss...
L328002 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I think we should have him in for a little talk.
L328001 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
L328000 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Can you get some sworn statements?
L327837 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
L327836 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
L327833 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ To frame him, obviously.  You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill!  They're not ordinary crooks.
L327832 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ But why?
L327831 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ It went to the goddamn FBI and they didn't find a goddamn thing.  It comes back a week later and one guy in the Dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all I know he could've taken off Oswald at the morgue.  There's no chain of evidence, Bill.  And what about the tow guns actually seen in the Depository?  One an Enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a Mauser, described by Deputy Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee Oswald was exactly what he said he was Bill - "a patsy".  Take it at face value.  Lou, Susie, I'm going with my gut here.  He's got an alias of Hidell to buy the rifle, "O.H. Lee" to rent the room, right?  What's in a name, right?  In intelligence, they're assumed to be fake.  A name is sort of like a postbox number, a code - several different people can use the same name, right?  Then why can't somebody be using Oswald's name?
L327830 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ He had his palm print on the weapon.
L327829 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
L327828 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!
