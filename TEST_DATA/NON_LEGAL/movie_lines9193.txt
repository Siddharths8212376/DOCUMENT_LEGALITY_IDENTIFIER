L320027 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ No way! He can't!
L320026 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ He's heading under -- !
L320001 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on --  Slower! Throttle back ---
L320000 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ Coming right to us!
L319992 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ The shaft is giving.
L319991 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Easy! It'll tear right out!
L319964 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ 'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944.
L319963 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ Don't tell me -- 'Death Before Dishonor.' 'Mother.' 'Semper Fi.' Uhhh... 'Don't Tread on Me.' C'mon -- what?
L319954 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ I think I can top that, Mister...
L319953 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ ...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last.
L319951 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ And I'll drink to yours.
L319950 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ I'll drink to your leg.
L319948 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
L319947 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...
L319946 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ Ever see one like this?
L319945 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here...  ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas.
L319944 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit.
L319943 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off.
L319909 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ 25 feet. And three tons of him there.
L319908 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ 20 feet, if it's an inch...
L319907 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ At least you handle the boat all right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine.
L319906 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ What do you see?
L319905 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Over there!
L319900 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Fasten the pole.
L319899 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ I'm okay...
L319898 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't ever tell me my business again. Get back up on the bridge.
L319893 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as I say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. Now get down here!
L319892 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ I don't know what it is, but it's not a shark.
L319891 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Down here, Hooper!
L319890 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ Let it go, don't waste your time.
L319889 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Gettin' ready to run again -- no? No?  What's he playin' here?  Put the gloves on!  Let's see who's gonna tease who now!
L319885 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh, Jim Boy.
L319884 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there...
L319875 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ It ain't a Big Mac.  The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation. 
L319874 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ That's pilot whale, isn't it?
L319873 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  Next time, ask me.
L319872 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?
L319870 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing...
L319869 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
L319865 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...
L319864 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ What's that supposed to prove?
L319844 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Who's inside, you or the shark?
L319843 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ Anti-Shark cage.
L319842 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?  Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower?
L319841 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello.
L319840 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait.
L319828 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ Look, I don't need to hear any of this working class hero crap. Some party boat skipper who's killed a few sharks...
L319827 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Ha. City hands. You been counting money. If you had a $5000 net and $2000 worth of fish in it, and along comes Mr. White, and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls. If you'd ever worked for a living, you'd know what that means.
L319826 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Let me see your hands...
L319825 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ I don't need to pass basic seamanship.
L319824 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Are you now. I know about porkers in the water --  Here. Tie me a sheepshank.
L319823 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
L319822 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
L319821 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ -- and an America's Cup Trials...
L319820 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Transplants?
L319819 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs --
L319711 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ That's it! I'm standing here arguing with a guy who can't wait to be a hot lunch. Goodbye.
L319710 +++$+++ u1653 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ VAUGHN +++$+++ Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a deliberate mutilation of a public service message! I want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their baby Buster Browns!
L319704 +++$+++ u1653 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ VAUGHN +++$+++ Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.
L319703 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.
L319700 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ I don't have it.
L319699 +++$+++ u1653 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ VAUGHN +++$+++ Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it?
L319596 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure...
L319595 +++$+++ u1653 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ VAUGHN +++$+++ I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state.
L319586 +++$+++ u1649 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ HOOPER +++$+++ Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
L319585 +++$+++ u1653 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ VAUGHN +++$+++ That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!
L329478 +++$+++ u1655 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER'S MOM +++$+++ I just hope you don't consider her a close friend.
L329477 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ You've mentioned it about fifty times.
L329476 +++$+++ u1655 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER'S MOM +++$+++ You know how I feel about her.
L329475 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Thanks for the message.
L329474 +++$+++ u1655 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER'S MOM +++$+++ Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
L329473 +++$+++ u1655 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER'S MOM +++$+++ But it's breakfast for supper. Your favorite, Paulie. I made French toast and sausage. Patties, not linkies, just like you like it.
L329472 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ I'm not hungry, oddly.
L329471 +++$+++ u1655 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER'S MOM +++$+++ You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
L329470 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ I don't think so.
L329469 +++$+++ u1655 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER'S MOM +++$+++ Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
L330146 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me? I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
L330145 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
L330144 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
L330143 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
L330142 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
L330141 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
L330107 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Okay.
L330106 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Can we make out now?
L330105 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
L330104 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
L330103 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
L330102 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Mine too.
L330101 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
L330100 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Wizard!
L330099 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ It does?
L330098 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
L330097 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
L330096 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
L330095 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ I try really hard, actually...
L330094 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
L330093 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ What, you mean as friends?
L330092 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Also, I think I'm in love with you.
L330091 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ You know it's okay.
L330090 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
L330089 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
L330088 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.
L330087 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Why?
L330086 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Yeah. That was me.
L330085 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
L329963 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?
L329962 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
L329961 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Huh?
L329960 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Wait, let me take that.
L329959 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Well at least you don't have to walk around with the evidence under your sweater. I'm a planet!
L329958 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ No...
L329957 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
L329956 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Oh my God, SHUT UP!
L329955 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I still have your virginity!
L329954 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Yeah, well... I still have your underwear.
L329953 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!
L329952 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
L329951 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
L329950 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
L329949 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
L329948 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ What?
L329947 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ You're being really immature.
L329945 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I doubt she was actually giving you the stinkeye. She just looks like that all the time.
L329944 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
L329943 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ You're mad. Why are you mad?
L329942 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
L329941 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ We're getting a stretch limo.
L329940 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.
L329939 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Leah just told me you were going with her.
L329938 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Um, hi?
L329937 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
L329847 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ I don't. Katrina smells like soup. Her whole house smells of soup.
L329846 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I totally heard you did.
L329845 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ I don't like Katrina.
L329844 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
L329843 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Well, we were once. You know, that time.
L329842 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Were we together?
L329841 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ We could get back together too.
L329840 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
L329839 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
L329838 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Well, I do.
L329837 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Jesus, Bleek.
L329836 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.
L329835 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge?
L329834 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Oh. That's a relief.
L329833 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
L329832 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Is that normal?
L329831 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
L329830 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Really? What are they like?
L329829 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.
L329828 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days.
L329826 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ I miss it too.
L329825 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
L329824 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ What's up?
L329668 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I'll try to drop by later.
L329667 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Okay, cool.
L329666 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
L329665 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.
L329385 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Or something.
L329384 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Charisma?
L329383 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
L329382 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
L329381 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ But you copy my work every week.
L329380 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
L329379 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.
L329378 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Well! Nothing like experimenting.
L329368 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I'll see you at school, O.K.?
L329367 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Whose idea was it?
L329366 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
L329365 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
L329364 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ So that's cool with you, then?
L329363 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
L329362 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
L329361 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ So, what do you think we should do?
L329360 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I know.
L329359 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ I'm supposed to be running.
L329358 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.
L329356 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I'm pregnant.
L329355 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ I don't know...
L329354 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Go Carole.  So, guess what?
L329353 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ My mom uses color-safe bleach.
L329352 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
L329351 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Cool.
L329350 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
L329349 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
L329348 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Hey Bleek.
L329664 +++$+++ u1669 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VIJAY +++$+++ Me neither. But I'm going to stop wearing underpants in order to raise my sperm count. See you.
L329663 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
L329662 +++$+++ u1669 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VIJAY +++$+++ You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
L329661 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ I don't really know anything about it.
L329660 +++$+++ u1669 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VIJAY +++$+++ What a trip, man.
L329659 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Yup.
L329658 +++$+++ u1669 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VIJAY +++$+++ Did you hear it's yours?
L329657 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Yup.
L329656 +++$+++ u1669 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VIJAY +++$+++ Just like our moms and teachers!
L329655 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Yup.
L329654 +++$+++ u1669 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VIJAY +++$+++ Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
L329653 +++$+++ u1654 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BLEEKER +++$+++ Oh, hey Vijay.
