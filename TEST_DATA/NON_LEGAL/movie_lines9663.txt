L123962 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ If it's the tall man -- he had one of those hair transplants.  Tufts, you know.  It still hasn't grown fully in.  The other one is from the islands.  Braided hair -- very dark.
L123961 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I might still get there first. The lights are with me.  How would I identify the guy who shows up at the bank?
L123960 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ The front door slammed.  Someone went out.  There's a different car starting.
L123959 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What's going on?
L123958 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Don't talk.  Don't talk!
L123957 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
L123956 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ To hide it from the I.R.S.
L123955 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
L123954 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Oh my God.  I heard her scream again.  What are they doing to her?  Why can't I do anything to stop them?
L123953 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm pretty good at signatures myself.
L123952 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
L123951 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ They've still got to be able to sign his name.
L123950 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
L123949 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ They'll recognize it's not your husband.
L123948 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I'm not supposed to -- but I do. Millions in cash and bearer bonds.
L123947 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Do you know what's in that box?
L123946 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Don't say that.
L123945 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Not a chance.
L123944 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Jack will negotiate with them. He'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let Rachel go.
L123943 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm cutting across to Bundy to Brentwood.  That bank is our best bet.  If anybody shows up I could follow them.
L123942 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Even if you found us -- what then?
L123941 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
L123940 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
L123939 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm not doing too well.  What's the matter?
L123936 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Black Mercedes, 600S.
L123935 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L123934 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.
L123933 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ The City National on San Vincente.
L123932 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What bank?
L123931 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ The one in Brentwood.
L123930 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?
L123929 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
L123928 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
L123927 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
L123926 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ He's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him.
L123921 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm trying to.
L123920 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
L123919 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ She's gone --
L123918 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ What's happening?
L123909 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I've got to ask somebody.
L123908 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ No.
L123907 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Does she wear glasses?
L123906 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ That's not her.
L123905 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
L123902 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Great.  Stay with me.  There must be a hundred kids out here.
L123901 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I can hear you again, clearly.
L123900 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Lenore, I'm here.  I'm getting out.
L123896 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm making my turn.  I see the school up ahead.
L123895 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Make a right.  You can't miss it.
L123887 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
L123886 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.
L123885 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ You're breaking up.  I can't hear you.  Theo?
L123884 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ That makes two of us.
L123883 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
L123882 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm about ten blocks from the school.
L123881 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
L123880 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ A price on everything.
L123879 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I didn't mean to.  It's just the way I am.
L123878 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Shit, stop with the money!  I never asked for a nickel.  I was just doing this.  And you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
L123877 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you.  Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
L123876 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
L123875 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
L123874 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ They say my work is somewhat derivative.
L123873 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
L123872 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Pictures.
L123871 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Our house always needs touching up.
L123870 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Sometimes I paint.
L123869 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ What do you do for a living?
L123867 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Well you did.
L123866 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
L123865 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
L123864 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ And that was the end of it?
L123863 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
L123862 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
L123861 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Hey drop it, okay?
L123860 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ A woman?
L123859 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I don't know.  I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of.
L123858 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
L123857 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
L123856 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ How much time do you have left on it?
L123855 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Where's the fucking recharger cord?  Must be in her car, dammit.
L123854 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm not looking to get myself killed.  I just hope the battery on this phone holds out.
L123853 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.
L123852 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Tell me what she looks like.
L123851 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
L123850 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
L123849 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ What are you doing now?
L123848 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
L123847 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ What about the others?
L123846 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Hello?  It's just me and you again.
L123823 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Another minute.
L123822 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Will you please speak to me! Theo?
L123817 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Just hang on.  I've got a life of my own.
L123816 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Why isn't anyone answering me?
L123797 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ She would if she heard my voice on the phone.
L123796 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
L123795 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ 26th off Wilshire.
L123794 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
L123793 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ "Theo?"
L123777 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ He's right?  Look, don't try to put blood on my hands.  You've got one hell of a nerve siding with him!
L123776 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ He's right.  You'll get my whole family killed.
L123774 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ They don't know you.  They won't listen.
L123773 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
L123772 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school.  Rachel will recognize the car.  She'll get right in.
L123769 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Bottom line!  There's nothing I can do for you but tip the cops.
L123768 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
L123767 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What do they need her for?
L123766 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
L123765 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Stop throwing names at me.
L123764 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
L123763 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm with two friends now.
L123760 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Don't move around.  You don't want to puncture a lung.
L123759 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
L123758 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm fine.  She's back on.  Hello?  I'm here.
L123731 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I can't stay on this line.  I'm picking people up.  I'm already overdue.  Hello? 
L123730 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
L123729 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Fine, no tunnel.  Are you still with me?  Hello?
L123717 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Shit!
L123716 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Please.
L123715 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm in traffic.  There's no place to turn.
L123714 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ No don't.  You could lose me for good.  Don't go through that tunnel.
L123713 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Listen, there's an overpass coming up.  I may lose you for a minute.
L123712 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
L123711 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Oh man.  These people mean business.
L123710 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Elliot -- our driver.  The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot's head and -- fired.  It was so quick.
L123709 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Who?
L123708 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
L123707 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What makes you say that?
L123706 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
L123705 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ The cops could trace this call back to you.
L123704 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
L123703 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Okay.  The police are gonna need your full name and address.
L123702 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ No -- nothing.
L123701 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
L123700 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.
L123699 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Where'd they take you to?
L123698 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ They tortured my husband.  Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts.  Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
L123697 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Why would anybody want to hurt you?
L123696 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Then hang up!  Do it!
L123695 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Don't lay this on me!
L123694 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Because you know you'll be killing us.
L123693 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Oh won't I?
L123692 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ You won't disconnect.
L123691 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I am not involved.  Keep clicking your little wires.  You'll get someone else.  Good luck.
L123690 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I realize you don't want to be involved.
L123689 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
L123688 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
L123687 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I don't want to know --
L123686 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ My name is --
L123685 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You're the one who's not to be believed.
L123684 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I don't believe you.
L123683 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You're not doing anything to me -- because -- listen to this carefully -- I do not care.
L123682 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
L123681 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Well I'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when I'm about to make the most important score of my life.  This has gotta be some "put-on," right?
L123680 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ They gave me pills to make me sleep.  They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
L123679 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Sure.  And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
L123678 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ They're holding my husband downstairs.
L123677 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Who smashed the phone?
L123676 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
L123675 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
L123674 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
L123673 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Lady, try making some sense.
L123672 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I can't talk any louder.  They might hear.
L123671 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ And what're you whispering for?
L123670 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Will you let me explain!
L123669 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
L123668 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ You don't understand.
L123667 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
L123666 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
L123665 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Do I know you?
L124516 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
L124515 +++$+++ u4394 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE'S VOICE +++$+++ Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
L124514 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Didn't we play this scene before?

L123664 +++$+++ u4394 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE'S VOICE +++$+++ You mustn't hang up.
L123663 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Who is this?
L123662 +++$+++ u4394 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE'S VOICE +++$+++ Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
L124188 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What are you planning to do when they got here?  They'll kill us. They'll kill Rachel.
L124187 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ Yeah.  Why don't we?
L124179 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Put the girl on.
L124178 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ Seems like it.
L124167 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Next I want to see Rachel.  Put her on the phone before she gets out so her mother can tell her exactly what to do.  Keep her calm.  Tell her you're fine and that she can join you in this car.
L124166 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ Don't worry.
L124165 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Count it.
L124160 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm backing up.
L124159 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
L124158 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Stop the crying.
L124150 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
L124149 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
L124148 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Are you trying to panic the women?
L124147 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ I'm opening the side door.  She'll step out.  But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back.
L124128 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I won't let 'em.
L124127 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
L124126 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
L124125 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ And then?
L124124 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
L124123 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ And not a nickel.
L124122 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You'll still have the girl and the husband.
L124121 +++$+++ u4395 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ Negative.
L124120 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
