L489305 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ This was one sadistic motherfucker.
L489304 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ He ate his fill, and was forced to continue eating... till his body rejected the food. the killer held a bucket under him, and then kept serving.  He took his time.  The coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours.  The victim's throat was swollen from the effort, and there was probably a point where he passed out.  That's when killer kicked him in the stomach.  Popped him.
L489300 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing?  It must have been intentional.
L489299 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ It could be nothing.
L489298 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ You always have to find one singular thing to focus on.  There's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.
L489297 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ This doesn't make any sense.
L489295 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink?  Near the food?
L489294 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Same color and texture.
L489273 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I just don't think we should have that sort of relationship.  We'd start quarreling over insignificant things.
L489272 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Okay... sure...  It's just that, with my old partner, you know...
L489271 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Is that clear?
L489269 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Yeah, well, all I want is...  Just, just don't be jerking me off.  That's all I ask.  Don't jerk me off.
L489268 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
L489267 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
L489266 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Good.
L489265 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.
L489264 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ No.
L489263 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ You've seen my files, right?  Seen the things I've done?
L489255 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Guessing at this point is useless.
L489254 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ You think it was poison?
L489252 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ I don't know.  Feel free to look for yourself, okay?
L489251 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Is there any blood in it?
L489250 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ It's a bucket of vomit.
L489247 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ There's a bucket.  Under the table.
L489246 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ What?
L489245 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ There's a bucket here.
L489243 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Please be quiet for a while, would you?
L489242 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ When we found him, he was lying there with a knife in his back, so what else could it be but homicide?  Except, I finally figured out... he held the knife behind him... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall... then he shoved his body backwards...
L489239 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Then, why are we wasting our time?  This guy's heart's got to be roughly the size of a canned ham.  If this isn't a coronary, I don't know what is.
L489238 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ No one yet.
L489237 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Who said this was murder?
L489234 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ For now.
L489233 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Drop it.
L489232 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead man who wasn't really dead until Davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut.
L489231 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into?
L489218 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Well, over the next seven days, do me the favor of remembering it.
L489217 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ I realize that.
L489216 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Not here.
L489215 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
L489214 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Let me tell you how I want this to go.  I want you to look, and I want you to listen.
L489213 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
L489212 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.
L489211 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
L489210 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ You just met me.
L489209 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ I'm here for the same reasons as you, I guess.  Or, at least, the same reasons you used to have for being here before... before you decided to... quit.
L489208 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
L489207 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ I... I don't follow.
L489206 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone.  I can't help wondering... why here?
L489205 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ I need to start getting the feel of it all, right?  Meet the people.
L489204 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Actually, if it's all the same, I'd like to get to the precinct house a.s.a.p.  Seeing how we don't have much time for this whole transition thing.
L489203 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile.  After that, we'll...
L489202 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ I'm a little thrown.  I just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here.
L489503 +++$+++ u7523 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MRS GOULD +++$+++ Why is this painting hanging upside-down?
L489502 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ What?
L489501 +++$+++ u7523 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MRS GOULD +++$+++ This painting...
L489496 +++$+++ u7523 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MRS GOULD +++$+++ I can't do this now... please.
L489495 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Are you absolutely certain?
L489494 +++$+++ u7523 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MRS GOULD +++$+++ I don't see anything.
L489493 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Anything... anything missing or different.
L489492 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Please, I need you to help me if we're going to get who did this.
L489491 +++$+++ u7523 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MRS GOULD +++$+++ I don't know why... why now?
L489490 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ I need you to look at each one carefully... very carefully.  Look for anything that seems strange or out of place.  Anything at all.
L489489 +++$+++ u7523 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MRS GOULD +++$+++ I... I don't understand.
L489488 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould.  I really am.
L489803 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I can tell you now, I know... I'm positive I made the right decision.  I'm positive. But, there's never a day that passes that I don't wish I had decided differently.
L489802 +++$+++ u7526 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ I want to have children.  It's just...
L489801 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
L489799 +++$+++ u7526 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ I hate this city.
L489798 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Oh, Tracy... I have to tell you, I'm not the one to talk to about this.
L489795 +++$+++ u7526 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ I don't know...
L489794 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ You should look into private schools.
L489793 +++$+++ u7526 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ I've been going to some of the schools, looking for work, but the conditions here are... horrible.
L489792 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ He mentioned it.
L489791 +++$+++ u7526 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.
L489790 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
L489789 +++$+++ u7526 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ I don't know why I asked you to come.
L489788 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
L489787 +++$+++ u7526 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Perfect example.
L489786 +++$+++ u7526 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ I'm sorry, I only...
L489785 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.
L489784 +++$+++ u7526 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ I don't sleep very well.
L489783 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ It's a hard place.
L489782 +++$+++ u7526 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ I mean, you known this city.  You've been here for so long.
L489781 +++$+++ u7526 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ If you can, please call me.  Please.  I have to go now... goodnight.
L489780 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I don't know, with this case.
L489430 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Too long.  What do you think so far?
L489429 +++$+++ u7526 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ How long have you lived here?
L489427 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me... disagreeable. Just ask your husband.
L489426 +++$+++ u7526 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ It surprises me.  It really does.
L489425 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I was close once.  It just didn't happen.
L489422 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I guess I won't be showing it to him then.
L489421 +++$+++ u7526 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting.  I'm sorry.  It's really none of my business.  It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  That's how he is.
L489416 +++$+++ u7526 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ No matter how often I see guns, I still can't get used to them.
L489415 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Don't worry.  I don't wear it at the dinner table.
L489413 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Really?
L489412 +++$+++ u7526 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
L489411 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I hear you and Mills were high school sweethearts.
L489409 +++$+++ u7526 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ What?  Oh, yes.  I mean, thank you.  Please, sit down.
L489408 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ It smells good.
L489406 +++$+++ u7526 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ It's a nice name.  William, I'd like you to meet David.  David... William.
L489405 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Oh... um, William.
L489404 +++$+++ u7526 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ It's nice to meet you.  My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.
L489197 +++$+++ u7525 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ I don't know.
L489196 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Did their son see it happen?
L489195 +++$+++ u7525 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
L489194 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
L489193 +++$+++ u7525 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Crime of passion.
L489192 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Why always like this?  Only after the fact... this sudden realization, that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in them, that person will cease to exist.
L489191 +++$+++ u7525 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ When the patrolman came she was trying put his head back together.  She was crying too hard to say anything.
L489190 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Did the wife confess?
L489189 +++$+++ u7525 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours.  It was nothing new.  But, then they heard the gun go off. Both barrels.
L490215 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Don't argue!...And stay close... Maybe they're rustlers...and maybe this dodderin' old idiot ain't so far wrong...
L490214 +++$+++ u7527 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Now, Ethan, I ain't sure...
L490171 +++$+++ u7527 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ You're my brother...You're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to...Ain't that so, Martha?
L490170 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You askin' me to clear out now?
L490167 +++$+++ u7527 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ They gave up...went back to the cotton rows...So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know...She wouldn't let a man quit.
L490166 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em?
L490134 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ It just happened to be me...No need to make any more of it...
L490133 +++$+++ u7527 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ It was Ethan found you squallin' in a sage clump after your folks was massacred...
L490121 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
L490120 +++$+++ u7527 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ But Mose Harper said...
L490119 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ How should I know?
L490118 +++$+++ u7527 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ How's California?
L490272 +++$+++ u7528 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I wish Uncle Ethan was here. Don't you, ma?
L490271 +++$+++ u7541 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ What, Ben?
L490270 +++$+++ u7528 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ It's all right, ma...I been watchin'... Only I wish...
L490144 +++$+++ u7528 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ It's not a sword, ma...It's a sabre!  Did you kill many damYankees with this sabre, Uncle Ethan?
L490143 +++$+++ u7541 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Not tonight...Ben, put that sword back.
L490127 +++$+++ u7541 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ That's enough...Go on inside and help Lucy set the table...You, too, Deborah!
L490126 +++$+++ u7528 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
L490125 +++$+++ u7541 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Lucy's going on seventeen now...
L490434 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ What you saw was a buck wearin' Lucy's dress...  I found Lucy back there in that canyon...I wrapped her in my blanket an' buried her with m'own hands...I thought it best to keep it from you -- long as I could.
L490433 +++$+++ u7529 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ It was, I tell you!
L490432 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ What you saw wasn't Lucy.
L490423 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Huh...? No...no water.
L490422 +++$+++ u7529 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?
L490413 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ That'll be the day!...Let's ride.
L490412 +++$+++ u7529 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ You've said that enough!...Maybe Lucy's dead...maybe they're both dead...but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!
L490408 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Naw...a human man rides a horse till it dies...then he goes on afoot...A Comanche comes along...gets that horse up...and rides it twenty more miles...Then he eats it.
L490407 +++$+++ u7529 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ They got to stop <U>sometime</U>...if they're human at all, they got to stop!
L490340 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Why don't you finish the job?
L490339 +++$+++ u7529 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Let's get along...
L490251 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out...This here's a murder raid...  It shapes up to scald out either your place...or my brother's.
L490250 +++$+++ u7529 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Killed every one -- an' not for food either...Why'd they do a thing like that?
L490913 +++$+++ u7530 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I ain't wearing no gun.
L490912 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside.
L490910 +++$+++ u7530 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ AND other things...Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took...I bet she wasn't the first squaw you...
L490909 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
L490908 +++$+++ u7530 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
L490907 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
L490906 +++$+++ u7530 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
L490905 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ <U>Charlie</U> <U>MacCorry</U>!...You weren't fixin' to marry HIM??
L490973 +++$+++ u7530 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yes sir...
L490972 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word...
L490934 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
L490933 +++$+++ u7530 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...
L490923 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ Well, go get cleaned up and we'll proceed with the weddin'...
L490922 +++$+++ u7530 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Dunno...Seems so.
L490921 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ You all right, sergeant?
L490917 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ In that case, give the boys room...
L490916 +++$+++ u7530 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No sir...pleasure.
L490915 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
L490332 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan.
L490331 +++$+++ u7530 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
L490330 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ Another one, eh?
L491005 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
L491004 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I say NO!
L491000 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ Now mount up, son...
L490999 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.
L490996 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
L490995 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
L490989 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Enough to go around...I'd say about a dozen apiece...Mount 'em up!
L490988 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ How many, would you say?
L490987 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.
L490930 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ <U>Captain</U>...Nope, wouldn't say that... Likely you had your reasons for killin' Futterman...Probably needed killin'...I'm speaking as a ranger now, not as a reverend...Fact that all three was shot in the back is the only thing that's raised some question -- that and a missin' gold piece known to have been on him just prior to his demise.
L490929 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
L490928 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ I got to ask you and Martin to ride to the State Capitol with me, Ethan.
L490919 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone...
L490918 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ Fight fair, son...Use your fists!
L490889 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ Came here for a wedding, Ethan... Until that's over, I reckon 'reverend' will do...
L490888 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Evenin'...evenin' Reverend...or do I call you 'Captain'...?
L490386 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ You got one now!
L490385 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
L490384 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ I didn't give any order to fire!
L490371 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ How far's the river from here, Mose?
L490370 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded.
L490365 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ Just keep goin'...
L490364 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You got any more orders, Captain?
L490359 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Yes, sir...But if you're wrong, <U>Captain</U> Clayton, don't ever give me another!
L490358 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ ...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
L490357 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...
L490352 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ I thought we were trying to get the girls back -- <U>alive</U>...We jump those Comanches, they'll kill 'em...You know that!
L490351 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ It's what we're here for, ain't it?
L490350 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
L490349 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.
L490342 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ By what you preach...none!
L490341 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ What good does that do?
L490318 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ ...like a flower and is cut down... <U>Amen</U>!
L490317 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
