L424286 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Yeah? The sport utility?
L424285 +++$+++ u2380 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
L424284 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ ...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
L423888 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
L423887 +++$+++ u2381 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JERROLD +++$+++ Because it ain't natural, young man.
L423886 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ ...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
L423885 +++$+++ u2381 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JERROLD +++$+++ You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty...
L423878 +++$+++ u2381 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JERROLD +++$+++ Oh, there's no tellin' what that girl could've accomplished, and she never had it easy. Never really had a childhood... caring for her father, going to school.
L423877 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Would you say she was ambitious?
L423876 +++$+++ u2381 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JERROLD +++$+++ And she always had such spirit! But, after her mother died...
L424084 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ Know him? We were gonna get married! He was gonna leave his wife for me! Fuck!!...
L424083 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Yeah. Why, you know him?
L424082 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
L424081 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
L424080 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ What did you say?
L424079 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
L424078 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway.
L424077 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ Blah -- blah -- blah... Hurry up, will ya, I got a date tonight...
L424076 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.
L424075 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ No... before that.
L424074 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
L424073 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too.
L424072 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
L424071 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ You're wastin' your time, Roy.
L424093 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
L424092 +++$+++ u2385 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ MERCEDES +++$+++ Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
L424051 +++$+++ u2385 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ MERCEDES +++$+++ Loma Vista?  You mean like the guy on "A Reason to Love?"
L424050 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
L424049 +++$+++ u2385 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ MERCEDES +++$+++ God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
L424048 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ David Ravell.
L424047 +++$+++ u2385 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ MERCEDES +++$+++ Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
L424046 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
L424045 +++$+++ u2385 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ MERCEDES +++$+++ So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
L424044 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
L424043 +++$+++ u2385 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ MERCEDES +++$+++ So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
L424042 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
L424041 +++$+++ u2385 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ MERCEDES +++$+++ What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore?
L424512 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I swear to God!
L424511 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ You lie, motherfucker...
L424510 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ She's a lesbian.
L424509 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
L424508 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
L424507 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Did Chloe crack?
L424506 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
L424505 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you, before I kill you!
L424169 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.
L424168 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
L424167 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
L424166 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Huh?
L424165 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ Mr. Campbell?
L424164 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Yeah?
L423749 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Jasmine... Do you have yesterday's show on tape, by any chance?
L423748 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
L423747 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I see.  Did Chloe testify?
L423746 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ "A Reason to Love."
L423745 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Her show?
L423744 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
L423743 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
L423742 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
L423741 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Aren't they precious?  Ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area?
L423740 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ I wish I could help you, but I can't.
L423739 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
L426158 +++$+++ u2390 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ BIG DAN +++$+++ No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.
L426157 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.
L426151 +++$+++ u2390 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ BIG DAN +++$+++ And thank you as well for that conversational hiatus; I generally refrain from speech while engaged in gustation. There are those who attempt both at the same time but I find it course and vulgar. Now where were we?
L426150 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Our pleasure, Big Dan.
L426149 +++$+++ u2390 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ BIG DAN +++$+++ Thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was feeling a mite peckish.
L426133 +++$+++ u2390 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ BIG DAN +++$+++ Sales, Mr. McGill, sales! And what do I sell? The Truth! Ever' blessed word of it, from Genesee on down to Revelations! That's right, the word of God, which let me add there is damn good money in during these days of woe and want! Folks're lookin' for answers and Big Dan Teague sells the only book that's got 'em! What do you do - you and your tongue-tied friend?
L426132 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
L426131 +++$+++ u2390 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ BIG DAN +++$+++ I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
L426489 +++$+++ u2391 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ COOLEY +++$+++ The law. Well the law is a human institution.
L426488 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ It ain't the law!
L426482 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ You can't do this - we just been pardoned!  By the Governer himself!
L426481 +++$+++ u2391 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ COOLEY +++$+++ - and share one of your graves.
L426480 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Hang on there -
L426479 +++$+++ u2391 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ COOLEY +++$+++ Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -
L426478 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ You can't do this -
L426477 +++$+++ u2391 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ COOLEY +++$+++ You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
L426476 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Waitaminute -
L426475 +++$+++ u2391 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ COOLEY +++$+++ - but now it deposits you here.
L426474 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Waitaminute -
L426473 +++$+++ u2391 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ COOLEY +++$+++ End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns -
L426493 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Good Lord, what do we do?
L426492 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
L426326 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.
L426325 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ Huh?!
L426324 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
L426323 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
L426322 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ No, they never did turn me into a toad.
L426321 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad.
L426280 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Do not seek the treasure!
L426279 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ ...Pete?
L426005 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ What about you, Everett? What'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place?
L426004 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ Visit those foreclosin' sonofaguns down at the Indianola Savings and Loan and slap that cash down on the barrelhead and buy back the family farm. Hell, you ain't no kind of man if you ain't got land.
L425992 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.
L425991 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ Why don't we bed down out here tonight?
L425975 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ All except fer our a-cump-uh-nust!
L425974 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
L425973 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ That's right!
L425911 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ You mis'able little sneak thief...
L425910 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
L425903 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ Gopher, Everett?
L425902 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ We ain't gonna make it walkin'.
L425840 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, thirteen year'n?
L425839 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ 'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.
L426500 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ That ain't it!
L426499 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
L426498 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ A miracle! It was a miracle!
L426464 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
L426463 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
L426452 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?
L426451 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs.
L426447 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ Oh, okay.
L426446 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
L426445 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ What sat mean exactly, Everett?
L426403 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ Everett, my beard itches.
L426402 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...
L426396 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ He was never turned into a frog!
L426395 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ 'N turned into a frog -
L426354 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ Oh my God!
L426353 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
L426346 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Boys, we was chained together. I hadda tell ya somethin'. Bustin' out alone was not a option!
L426345 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty years for me too.
L426339 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ I never knocked over any armored- car. I was sent up for practicing law without a license.
L426338 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ So - where's all the money from your armored-car job?
L426274 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Oh-ho-ho yes, I've spread my seed. And you see what it, uh... what it's earned me... Now what in the...
L426273 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.
L426272 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man!
L426271 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
L426270 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
L426269 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ Okay, Everett.
L426268 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember that one simple precept and your time with me will not have been ill spent!
L426192 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ Not that I'm aware.
L426191 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Pete have a brother?
L426135 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ We're adventurers, sir, currently pursuin' a certain opportunity but open to others as well.
L426134 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ Uh, we uh-
L426122 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Well if that is Pete I am ashamed of him.  The way I see it he got what he deserved - fornicating with some whore a Babylon.  These things-
L426121 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.
L426120 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ You can't display a toad in a fine restaurant like this! Why, the good folks here'd go right off their feed!
L426117 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!
L426116 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ ...I'm not sure that's Pete.
L426113 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh- reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney- toad!
L426112 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar!
L426109 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!
L426108 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Whuhh...
L426073 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Well ya know, Delmar, they say that with a thrill-seekin' personality, what goes up must come down. Top of the world one minute, haunted by megrims the next. Yep, it's like our friend George is a alley cat and his own damn humors're swingin' him by the tail. But don't worry, Delmar; he'll be back on top again. I don't think we've heard the last of George Nelson.
L426072 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?
L426021 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Now you may call it an unreasoning optimism. You may call it obtuse. But the plain fact is we still have... close to... close to...
L426020 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ Yeah, look at me.
L426016 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Where's Tommy?
L426015 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
L426014 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!
L426013 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ Damn! We gotta skedaddle!
L426000 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ What're you gonna do with your share of the treasure, Pete?
L425999 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ Izzat right?
L425998 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Four hundred, Delmar.
L425997 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ Five... hunnert... thousand... each.
L425954 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?
L425953 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.
L425945 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ Pull over, Everett - let's give that colored boy a lift.
L425944 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're my cross to bear-
L425941 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ You should a joined us, Everett. It couldn't a hurt none.
L425940 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
L425939 +++$+++ u2392 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ DELMAR +++$+++ But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!
