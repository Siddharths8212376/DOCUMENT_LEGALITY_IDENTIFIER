L516413 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ I believe so.
L516412 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ I'm curious.  The D-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?
L516411 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Apparently.
L516410 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
L516409 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ No.
L516408 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ No spare.
L516407 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
L516406 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?
L516404 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
L516403 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
L516402 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
L516401 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
L516400 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ It is.
L516399 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ You found three batteries, you say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?
L516398 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ You have to wonder.
L516397 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
L516396 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Does it now?
L516395 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
L516394 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ And yet you started the engine right up.  With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  Did that strike you odd?
L516393 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
L516392 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ I think you testified <u>all</u> the lights were on.  Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...
L516391 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Maybe.
L516390 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
L516389 +++$+++ u7701 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.  And forgot the cup.
L516464 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ <u>Yes</u>, I'm sure.
L516463 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Are you absol...
L516462 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ Absolutely not.  Probably one or two hours.  Four at the most.
L516461 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
L516460 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ Can I say something, here?
L516459 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ For the third time, yes.
L516458 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
L516457 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ For certain, no.
L516456 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ <u>And</u> that you can't say for <u>certain</u> whether the head injury was sustained before or <u>after</u> death?
L516455 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ I already said that, b...
L516454 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
L516453 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ Sure, anything's poss...
L516452 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Is it possible?
L516451 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.
L516450 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
L516449 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ The same.
L516448 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around?  Or would both look the same.
L516447 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ Obviously.
L516446 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ In your motorcycle example.  Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled <u>against</u> an object. Rather than the reverse, yes?
L516444 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...?
L516443 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ Well...
L516442 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
L516441 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ That's <u>why</u> the autopsy report identifies <u>drowning</u> as the cause of death.
L516439 +++$+++ u7705 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ WHALEY +++$+++ As I testified.  It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration.  I believe I said that.
L516438 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ So this...foam you found in the lungs.  How does it get there?
L516907 +++$+++ u7704 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ SUSAN MARIE +++$+++ That's all he said.
L516906 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
L516905 +++$+++ u7704 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ SUSAN MARIE +++$+++ Carl said he didn't like Kabuo much anymore.

L516902 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ You can speak for what he <u>said</u>. Just like you did for Mr. Hooks...
L516901 +++$+++ u7704 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ SUSAN MARIE +++$+++ I can't speak for him.
L516900 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
L516899 +++$+++ u7704 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ SUSAN MARIE +++$+++ He had no reason to.
L516898 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
L516897 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Of course not.  But it was emotional.  A friend's plea set against his mother's attitude.
L516896 +++$+++ u7704 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ SUSAN MARIE +++$+++ Carl never lied.
L516895 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ I guess you'd have to guess. Not having been there with them. Having to guess whether your husband's report was word for word accurate.
L516893 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ So the defendant was encouraged to hope.  Or could have been.
L516892 +++$+++ u7704 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ SUSAN MARIE +++$+++ Not in those words.
L516891 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
L516890 +++$+++ u7704 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ SUSAN MARIE +++$+++ I wouldn't say encouraged.
L516889 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ So your husband said he's think it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...
L519214 +++$+++ u7706 +++$+++ m521 +++$+++ CHURCH +++$+++ Whatever the latest jargon is.                                   MEKUM Much better, much higher.  For example, where your old ones expressed ninety percent of their sexual energy in aggressive physicality, these new ones are ninety-nine percent without sexual inclination.  It's <u>all</u> aggression.                                   SLOAN                          <u>Real</u> men!                                   CHURCH                          At ease, Lieutenant.                          What if they fought?     A sudden silence.     SLOAN raises her eyebrows, gives RUBRICK a look.     Frowning thoughtfully, MEKUM looks up. MEKUM You mean up there?                                   CHURCH                                             Go ahead, Rube.  Tell Todd to take him. MEKUM No!     They all look at MEKUM.  Is this the chink in the armor?  The new soldiers can't fight?                                   CHURCH                    "No"? MEKUM Not fair.  No contest.  Send two more of your old ones up.     Now CHURCH, RUBRICK, and SLOAN are stunned.  They exchange a glance.                                   MEKUM Go ahead.
L519213 +++$+++ u7707 +++$+++ m521 +++$+++ MEKUM +++$+++ Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
L519212 +++$+++ u7707 +++$+++ m521 +++$+++ MEKUM +++$+++ Melton, on the double!  Up a chain!                                   MELTON  Sir!     MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid- stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters.     Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then passes him. MEKUM, watching, smirks.     CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow is knit, something's bothering him.     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a "platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all...     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.                                   CHURCH                    What about...spirit?
L519204 +++$+++ u7706 +++$+++ m521 +++$+++ CHURCH +++$+++ Maybe we could run some tests.  Kind of a comparison, the old and the new...

L519202 +++$+++ u7706 +++$+++ m521 +++$+++ CHURCH +++$+++ The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
L519201 +++$+++ u7707 +++$+++ m521 +++$+++ MEKUM +++$+++ That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
L519200 +++$+++ u7706 +++$+++ m521 +++$+++ CHURCH +++$+++ Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
L519199 +++$+++ u7707 +++$+++ m521 +++$+++ MEKUM +++$+++ I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
L519198 +++$+++ u7706 +++$+++ m521 +++$+++ CHURCH +++$+++ ...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
L519197 +++$+++ u7706 +++$+++ m521 +++$+++ CHURCH +++$+++ Mmmmmm.  Weeell, you know my old daddy was in maintenance and he had a saying...
L519196 +++$+++ u7707 +++$+++ m521 +++$+++ MEKUM +++$+++ As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
L519195 +++$+++ u7706 +++$+++ m521 +++$+++ CHURCH +++$+++ Improved...how?
L521500 +++$+++ u7708 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ BELLHOP +++$+++ Never mind leaving your door open - I got a passkey.

L521257 +++$+++ u7708 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ BELLHOP +++$+++ Because I'm working the night shift - and I got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there's a lull -

L521253 +++$+++ u7708 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ BELLHOP +++$+++ Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.

L521856 +++$+++ u7711 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ FIRST HENCHMAN +++$+++ He even got Charlie's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated.
L521855 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
L521854 +++$+++ u7711 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ FIRST HENCHMAN +++$+++ Say, boss - I been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.  Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together.

L521849 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You crazy or something?  The place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you're making like Diamond Jim Brady!  How are we going to get out of here?  How are we going to eat?
L521834 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.  It's on the level this time.
L521833 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
L521832 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
L521831 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ All right. What happened to our bracelet?
L521830 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
L521829 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?
L521828 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yeah - lets shove off.
L521827 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I don't know about the captain - but the navigator is getting his tail out of here.
L521796 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I may throw up.
L521795 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Hello, my dearest darling.  So good to hear your voice again.
L521792 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Hello, Room 414?  This is the ship-to-shore operator - I have a call for Miss Sugar Cane.
L521791 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
L521790 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
L521789 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
L521788 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
L521787 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Telephone call?  Who's got time for that?
L521786 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What do you think you're doing?
L521785 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Get me Room 414.
L521784 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Sugar?
L521783 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar.
L521782 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive, you know what we're going to do? We're going to sell the bracelet, and grab a boat to South America and hide out in one of those banana republics -  The way I figure is, if we eat nothing but bananas, we can live there for fifty years - maybe a hundred years - that is, if we get out of the hotel alive.  Did we forget anything?
L521780 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ But they're from Osgood.  He wanted me to wear them tonight.
L521779 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Not that, you idiot.
L521778 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Okay, Joe.
L521777 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Shut up and keep packing.
L521776 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I tell you, Joe, they're on to us.  They're going to line us up against the wall and -  Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh - and then the police are going to find two dead dames, and they're going to take us to the ladies' morgue, and when they undress us - I tell you, Joe, I'm just going to die of shame.
L521761 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What?
L521760 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Joe -
L521759 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.
L521758 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What are you giving me with the omelette?
L521757 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
L521756 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.
L521755 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Get it while you're young.  And you better fix your lips.  You want to look nice for Osgood, don't you?
L521754 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I feel like such a tramp - taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses.
L521701 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Daphne got a proposal tonight.
L521700 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ That's some nerve!
L521685 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Wait a minute - lets not be hasty. After all, we don't want to hurt poor Osgood's feelings.
L521684 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
L521683 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Hey - these are real diamonds.
L521681 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What engagement present?
L521680 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
L521679 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
L521678 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
L521677 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
L521676 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
L521675 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh.
