L555484 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
L555483 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It will?
L555482 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
L555481 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
L555480 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Good.
L555437 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER.
L555436 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Oh, you --
L555434 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in.
L555433 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ So do I.
L555432 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
L555431 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
L555430 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Honest to goodness, I hate you.
L555429 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ You're on your own.  Stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.
L555428 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You're tough, all right.
L555427 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.
L555426 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Nobody can be that busy.
L555425 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ It's just impossible.
L555424 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
L555423 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
L555422 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ We're engaged.
L555421 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What has Artie to do with it.
L555420 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.
L555419 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I'm all tied up.  I can't.
L555418 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
L555417 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Sorry.  It's your baby now.
L555416 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'll make it short.
L555415 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ...
L555414 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ...
L555413 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Check.
L555412 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
L555411 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
L555410 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.
L555409 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What about all those ideas you had?
L555408 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
L555407 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.
L555406 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Why should you do that?
L555405 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I mean it.  It's no good to me anyway.  Help yourself.
L555403 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Well, for heaven's sake!
L555402 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Just so you don't think I'm a complete swine -- if there's anything in Dark Windows you can use, take it.  It's all yours.
L555291 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ So long.
L555290 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You sure have.
L555289 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Sorry if I crossed you up.
L555288 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal.  I don't want to be a reader all my life.  I want to write.
L555283 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ As a matter of fact.  I've given up writing altogether.
L555282 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I tell you this is half sold.
L555281 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
L555278 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
L555277 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I was afraid of that.
L555276 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
L555275 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ O.K.  Where's the cash?
L555272 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Into something for Barbara Stan- wyck.  They have a commitment with Barbara Stanwyck.
L555271 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Into what? A lampshade?
L555270 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ He thinks it could be made into something.
L555269 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ You did?
L555268 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
L555267 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What teacher?
L555266 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
L555265 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
L555264 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
L555263 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.
L555262 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Stop it, Artie, will you?  Where have you been keeping your- self? I've got the most wonderful news for you.
L555258 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You don't know how glad I am to see youl
L555257 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Hello, Artie.  Good evening, Miss Schaefer.
L555204 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Life can be beautiful!
L555203 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ With a wildly beating heart.
L555202 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ You'll be waiting for me?
L555201 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
L555200 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
L555199 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No, Phillip, no.  We must be strong.  You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards!  Furthermore, you can have the phone now.
L555196 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Phillip, you're mad!
L555195 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
L555194 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Are you hungry?
L555193 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
L555192 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
L555191 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Well....
L555190 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ As for instance?
L555189 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?
L555188 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
L555187 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
L555186 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
L555185 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Who wants true? Who wants moving?
L555184 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
L555183 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I had a teacher like that once.
L555182 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
L555181 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Now if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.
L555178 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ How about the Rainbow Room?
L555177 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Is there someplace we can talk?
L555176 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Except for about six pages. You've got a flashback there ...
L555175 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Thank you.
L555174 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I didn't.
L555173 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
L555172 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ There's one called....Window... something with a window.
L555171 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Why, you sweet kid.
L555170 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
L555169 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
L555168 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I've been hoping to run into you.
L555167 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Thanks.
L555166 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You forgot this.
L555163 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ About that luggage.  Where's the phone?
L555162 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Hurt feelings department.
L555159 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Sure.  Bases Loaded.
L555158 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.
L554836 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ So you take Plot 27-A, make it glossy, make it slick --
L554835 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living.
L554834 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent.
L554829 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Exactly what kind of material do you recommend?  James Joyce? Dostoosvsky?
L554828 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
L554827 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ If I could be of any help...
L555443 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I'm not worried.  Everything will be fine.  The old team together. Nothing can stop us.
L555442 +++$+++ u7957 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DE MILLE +++$+++ Goodbye, young fellow.  We'll see what we can do.
L555381 +++$+++ u7957 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DE MILLE +++$+++ You know, crazy things happen in this business.  I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...
L555380 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
L555364 +++$+++ u7957 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DE MILLE +++$+++ Gordon Cole... Look, Norma, I'm in the middle of a rehearsal.  Make yourself comfortable.
L555363 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
L555362 +++$+++ u7957 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DE MILLE +++$+++ Gordon Cole?
L555361 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
L555360 +++$+++ u7957 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DE MILLE +++$+++ What assistant?
L555359 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
L555358 +++$+++ u7957 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DE MILLE +++$+++ Yes, I did.
L555357 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
L555356 +++$+++ u7957 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DE MILLE +++$+++ I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
L555355 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You'd better.  I'm very angry.
L555354 +++$+++ u7957 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DE MILLE +++$+++ Norma, I want to apologize for not calling you.
L555353 +++$+++ u7957 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DE MILLE +++$+++ Lots of people were.  Lindbergh had just landed in Paris.  Come on in.
L555352 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Last time I saw you was someplace very gay.  I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.
L555351 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Hello, Mr. deMille.
L555350 +++$+++ u7957 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DE MILLE +++$+++ Hello, young fellow.
L555391 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
L555390 +++$+++ u7958 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DEMILLE +++$+++ Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
L555389 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
L555388 +++$+++ u7958 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DEMILLE +++$+++ It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
L555387 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ It's a good script, isn't it?
L555386 +++$+++ u7958 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DEMILLE +++$+++ That's what I want to talk to you about.
L555385 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
L555384 +++$+++ u7958 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DEMILLE +++$+++ We've missed you too, dear.
L555383 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it.
L555382 +++$+++ u7958 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DEMILLE +++$+++ What's the matter, Norma?
L555630 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ No one leaves a star.  That makes one a star.
L555629 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Goodbye.  Norma.
L555628 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I'm the greatest star of them all.
L555627 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Norma, grow up.  You're a woman of fifty.  There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.
L555626 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You heard him.  I'm a star!
L555624 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ That isn't true! Max?
L555623 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
L555622 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
L555621 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
L555620 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Wanted what?
L555619 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
L555618 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ What about the studio? What about De Mille?
L555617 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ No, they don't.
L555616 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ That's a lie!  They still want me!
L555615 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Wake up, Norma.  You'd be killing yourself to an empty house.  The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.
L555614 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
L555613 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
L555612 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
L555611 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You think I made that up about the gun...
L555610 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ That's between you and yourself, Norma.
L555609 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
L555608 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
L555607 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
L555606 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
L555605 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.
L555604 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.
L555603 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Max is a good idea.  He can help with my luggage.  Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.
L555602 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ No, you're not.  Max! Max!
L555601 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Yes, I am, Norma.
L555600 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ What are you doing, Joe?  What are you doing?  You're not leaving me?
L555473 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Of course you haven't.  I wouldn't let you.
L555472 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I haven't done anything, Norma.
L555471 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
L555470 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
L555469 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ No you didn't.  You took the car.
L555468 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I went for a walk.
L555467 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
L555466 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Why do you say that?
L555465 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
L555464 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I think I'll read a little.
L555463 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You'd better get to bed yourself.
L555462 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Good.
L555461 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.
L555460 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Good.
L555459 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
L555458 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Good night.
L555457 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.
L555456 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Yes, Norma.
L555455 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Don't turn around.  Keep your eyes on the book.
L555449 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can smell box office.  Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.
L555448 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ He must be quite a guy.
L555447 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set.  Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
L555446 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ How did it go?
L555349 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Thank you, darling.
L555348 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.
L555347 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Don't you want to come along, darling?
L555317 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I know that trick! He wants to belittle me.  He's trying to get my price down.  I've waited twenty years for this call.  Now Mr. deMille can wait till I'm good and ready.
L555316 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Maybe deMille is shooting.
L555315 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.
L555302 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ All right.  Give me this.  I need it for a moustache.  Now close your eyes.
L555301 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
L555300 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand ... Mabel was always stepping on my feet ...What's the matter with you, darling?  Why are you so glum?
L555296 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Where are your...?
