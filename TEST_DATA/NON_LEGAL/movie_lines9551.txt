L47547 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Thank you, sir.
L47546 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Now you're being bright?
L47545 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ So what's it going to be?
L47544 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I dig.
L47543 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?
L47542 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No key!
L47541 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ How's that again?
L47540 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Especially not Miss Kubelik.
L47539 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
L47538 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
L47537 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ What do you mean, sorry?
L47536 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
L47535 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Now I'll have to borrow your key.
L47534 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Very clever.
L47533 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
L47532 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Don't mind what?
L47531 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ The only thing is I'm staying at the Athletic Club -- and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind --
L47530 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I see.
L47529 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out -- I finally talked her into it --
L47528 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Naturally.
L47527 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
L47526 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L47525 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
L47524 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover. Thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get married, twenty-two percent quit because --
L47500 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Oh?
L47499 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I got kicked in the head, too.
L47498 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ That's just one of the privileges that goes with this job. You also get a nice little expense account, the use of the executive washroom --  Say, what happened to you, Baxter?
L47497 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L47496 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
L47495 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
L47494 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
L47493 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Mine?
L47492 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ You like?  It's all yours.
L47490 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter.
L47489 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
L47488 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Now what was your news, Baxter?
L47487 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah --
L47486 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
L47485 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You left your wife?
L47484 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
L47483 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You're going to take her off my hands?
L47482 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
L47481 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Sir?
L47480 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
L47479 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you --
L47320 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can I help her -- my hands are tied --
L47319 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
L47318 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
L47317 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --
L47316 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
L47315 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering.
L47128 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes, sir -- I understand.  She left a note -- you want me to open it and read it to you?  Well, it was just a suggestion -- no, you don't have to worry about that, Mr. Sheldrake -- I kept your name out of it so there'll be no trouble, police-wise or newspaper- wise --
L47127 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ That's impossible.  You'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact, I'm counting on you --
L47126 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I thought maybe you'd like to be here when she wakes up.
L47122 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ What?
L47121 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who I mean -- I found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
L47120 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ You're not making sense, Baxter. What's this all about?
L47119 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I hate to disturb you, but something came up -- it's rather important -- and I think it would be a good idea if you could see me -- at the apartment -- as soon as possible.
L47118 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Hello? -- yes -- what's on your mind, Baxter?
L46850 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Roger. And I'll get that other key.
L46849 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Put me down for Thursday again.
L46848 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
L46847 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
L46846 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No, sir. That's very unfair -- especially to your wife.
L46845 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ You see a girl a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife. I ask you -- is that fair?
L46844 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I know how it is.
L46843 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ You know how it is -- sooner or later they all give you a bad time.
L46842 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Sir?
L46841 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ So it was.  She threw it at me.
L46840 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ The mirror is broken.  It was broken when I found it.
L46839 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Oh, yes. Thanks.
L46838 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I mean -- the young lady -- whoever she may be -- it was on the couch when I got home last night.
L46837 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ To me?
L46835 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes, sir. You can't be too careful.
L46834 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
L46833 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
L46832 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
L46831 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well -- I guess so.
L46830 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
L46829 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I like the way you handled that. Well, how does it feel to be an executive?
L46825 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Don't thank me -- thank your friends here -- they're the ones who recommended you.
L46824 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
L46823 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Morning, gentlemen.  Everything satisfactory? You like your office?
L46692 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You too, sir.
L46691 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
L46690 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
L46689 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Not that I have anything to hide.
L46688 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, you don't have to worry --
L46687 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ You know how people talk.
L46686 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes, of course.
L46685 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Now remember, Baxter -- this is going to be our little secret.
L46683 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Thank you, sir.
L46682 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Relax, Baxter.
L46681 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --
L46679 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Now put down the key --  -- and put down the address.
L46678 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I am?
L46677 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material.
L46676 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ This?
L46675 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh?  Oh!
L46674 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ It also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
L46673 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Swap them? For what?
L46672 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
L46671 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
L46670 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
L46669 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
L46668 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
L46667 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
L46666 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ How would you like to go tonight?
L46665 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.
L46664 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man?
L46663 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L46662 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I'm not through with you yet.
L46661 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
L46660 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Where are you going, Baxter?
L46656 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, usually I slip it to them in the office and they leave it under the mat -- but never again -- I can promise you that --
L46655 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ How do you work it with the key?
L46654 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
L46653 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Where is your apartment?
L46652 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, it won't. Believe me. And it's not going to happen again. From now on, nobody is going to use my apartment --
L46651 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
L46650 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise.
L46649 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Baxter, an insurance company is founded on public trust. Any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming --  How many charter members are there in this little club of yours?
L46648 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, about six months ago -- I was going to night school, taking this course in Advanced Accounting -- and one of the guys in our department -- he lives in Jersey -- he was going to a banquet at the Biltmore -- his wife was meeting him in town, and he needed someplace to change into a tuxedo -- so I gave him the key    and word must have gotten around -- because the next thing I knew, all sorts of guys were suddenly going to banquets -- and when you give the key to one guy, you can't say no to another and the whole thing got out of hand -- pardon me.
L46647 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ You better.
L46646 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No, sir. I'm not going to deny it. But if you'd just let me explain --
L46645 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Are you going to deny it?
L46644 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh.
L46643 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
L46642 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Who?
L46641 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
L46640 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Sir?
L46639 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ What kind of joint are you running?
L46638 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
L46637 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ That's right, Baxter.
L46636 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ The Vice Squad?
L46635 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ In 1957, we had an employee here, name of Fowler. He was very popular, too. Turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the Actuarial Department tying up the switchboard, figuring the odds on our I.B.M. machines -- so the day before the Kentucky Derby, I called in the Vice Squad and we raided the thirteenth floor.
L46634 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You do?
L46633 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I know everything that goes on in this building -- in every department -- on every floor -- every day of the year.
L46632 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Would you mind repeating the question?
L46631 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Think.
L46630 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I don't know.
L46629 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
L46628 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ That's very flattering.
L46627 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
L46626 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
L46625 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
L46624 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Mr. Dobisch said that?
L46623 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Been hearing some very nice things about you -- here's a report from Mr. Dobisch -- loyal, cooperative, resourceful --
L46622 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
L46621 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
L46620 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L46619 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Baxter?
L47461 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Who else?
L47460 +++$+++ u3733 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MATUSCHKA +++$+++ You?
L47459 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ On account of me.
L47452 +++$+++ u3733 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MATUSCHKA +++$+++ What does he mean, accident?
L47451 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No, no -- just had a little accident.
L47450 +++$+++ u3733 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MATUSCHKA +++$+++ Fran been sick or something?
L47449 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, this is Mr. Matuschka -- he's Miss Kubelik's -- he's got a cab downstairs --
L47448 +++$+++ u3733 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MATUSCHKA +++$+++ What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?
L47441 +++$+++ u3733 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MATUSCHKA +++$+++ Look, Buddy-boy -- if there wasn't a lady present, I'd clobber you.
L47440 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --
L47439 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
L47438 +++$+++ u3733 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MATUSCHKA +++$+++ Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
L47437 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?
L47434 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes?
L47433 +++$+++ u3733 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MATUSCHKA +++$+++ Baxter?
L47279 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No!
L47278 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us?
L47274 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Now will you get out?
L47273 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so?  You got yourself a little playmate, huh?
L47272 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Are you going to leave, Mr. Kirkeby, or do I have to throw you out?
L47271 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
L47270 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Look, you can't stay here. Just take your champagne and go.
L47269 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I made a reservation for four o'clock, remember?
L47268 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You can't come in.
L47267 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ What do I -- ?  Just a minute.
L47266 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What do you want?
L47265 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Hi, Baxter.
L46828 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ So long, fellas. Drop in any time. The door is always open -- to my office.
L46827 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ So long, Baxter. We know you won't let us down.
L46811 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, I'm very grateful.
L46810 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.
L46582 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Well -- it's all right with me, Bud. Let me check. I'll get back to you.
L46581 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --
L46580 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?
L46552 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Listen to him.  Little Lord Fauntleroy!
L46551 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.
L46550 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ A lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice.  What is she trying to prove?
L46549 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Maybe you're using the wrong approach.
L46548 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.
L46547 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
L46546 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ That Kubelik -- boy!  Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.
L46522 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes, sir.  They are indeed. 
L46521 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Oh, how are you, Baxter.  They keeping you busy these days?
L46520 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
L46461 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ I'll pay you on Friday.  And whatever happened to those little cheese crackers you used to have around?
L46460 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
L46459 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
L46458 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
