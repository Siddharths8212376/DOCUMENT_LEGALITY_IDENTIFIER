L366279 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
L366278 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
L366277 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ I came to visit you.
L366276 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L366275 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ So you'll be the silent type. People will appreciate that.
L366274 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
L366273 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good.
L366272 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles.
L366271 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
L366270 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
L366269 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
L366268 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.
L366258 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Everything happens once if you live long enough.
L366257 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ You did something on impulse?
L366256 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
L366255 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ How long you staying, Crease?
L366254 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.
L366253 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ You been working?
L366252 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ And a level five shithole is better than a level six. Your logic's inescapable.
L366251 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
L366250 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Yeah, right...
L366249 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.
L366248 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ But don't you stay in El Paso?
L366247 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
L366246 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ So how's business?
L366245 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ Don't give me that bullshit.
L366244 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Nothing wrong.
L366243 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ So what's wrong?
L366242 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ This is Mexico, they do everything backwards.
L366241 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
L366240 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ Everything happens once if you live long enough.
L366239 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
L366238 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
L366236 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ I'm in a Customs holding tank in Mexico City International. Bring a bunch of cash... about 5K. I'm going to need it.
L366235 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ What do you mean, I'm here?
L366234 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ I'm here.
L366233 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
L366232 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
L366651 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ You'll be back in the water in twenty- four hours.
L366650 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ You got that right.
L366649 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13.
L366648 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Dyslexic?
L366647 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
L366645 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ I could do it. Remember the day you wanted the pencil? I know why. And I saw that car again. I wrote the license number in my notebook. Except I missed the last number.
L366644 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Be a swimmer.
L366643 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
L366642 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Then be trained.
L366641 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
L366640 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
L366639 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
L366638 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
L366637 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Frank. Frankie.
L366636 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Pinta, we've got to go. Travel sucks at this time.
L366617 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
L366616 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ You think too much?
L366615 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
L366614 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
L366613 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Still not a question.
L366612 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
L366611 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ That's not a question.
L366610 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ You don't drink like you used to.
L366609 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Could I stop you?
L366608 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Could I ask you a question?
L366590 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ I'm a prisoner in them. Until the gunshot sets me free.
L366589 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ The blocks.
L366584 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Why today? And why'd she have to go with him?
L366583 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Your father has business.
L366582 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ What's so important in Los Angeles?
L366578 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
L366577 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
L366576 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ You welcome the sound. The sound is what lets you go. The sound is what frees you. You are a prisoner in those blocks until you hear the sound.
L366575 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ The gunshot holds no fear.
L366574 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.
L366571 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Are you afraid of me?
L366570 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ I know you're not.
L366569 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
L366566 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ It's no wonder you're late. Why didn't she just come with you?
L366565 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ I dropped her at home.
L366564 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Where's my mother?
L366563 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ You were never late before, I was worried.
L366562 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L366561 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ You're late.
L366554 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Yeah. Two or three.
L366553 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Did you used to?
L366552 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ No.
L366551 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
L366550 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ I guess that really does make me a hard case.
L366549 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
L366548 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
L366547 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Yes.
L366546 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Remember you asked me what state I was from?
L366543 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Don't worry. You will.
L366542 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ I don't understand.
L366541 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. You go. Don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate on the sound itself.
L366538 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ No, that was in Columbia.
L366537 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
L366536 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
L366535 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ So how come you know so much about those countries?
L366532 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ [Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]
L366531 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ You feel sorry for the husband?
L366530 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ It must be difficult having lots of wives.
L366529 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
L366528 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
L366527 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Well, it's a sort of wife.
L366526 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ It was in a book at school. Concubine.
L366525 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Why do you ask?
L366522 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ You need to practice.
L366521 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
L366520 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ In a week you should be fine.
L366519 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
L366518 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
L366517 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Yes.
L366516 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Did you sleep alright?
L366509 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ I don't talk to them much. Does he have a name?
L366508 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
L366507 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Do you always sleep with him?
L366506 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
L366505 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
L366498 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ My ankle.
L366497 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ I don't think they're broken. Anywhere else?
L366496 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Everywhere!
L366495 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Where?
L366494 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ It hurts.
L366488 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ They can stay for two weeks. I don't care.
L366487 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ They'll be back in a week.
L366481 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Yes. Actually, he was driving me crazy.
L366480 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ It's better to be free, right?
L366479 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Well, I let him go.
L366478 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ How do you think he got out?
L366477 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ No.
L366476 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Maybe. Did you hear him?
L366475 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Do you think he'll come back?
L366474 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
L366473 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ What are you doing?
L366471 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.
L366470 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ You're fast.
L366449 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ I go to school, don't I?
L366448 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Pinta, do you have a pencil?
L366414 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ I'm not crying.
L366413 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ And don't start crying.
L366408 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Oh...
L366407 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
L366406 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ So you were unhappy?
L366405 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
L366404 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Hmmm?
L366403 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ But why not?
L366402 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ No.
L366401 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Not at all?
L366400 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ No.
L366399 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Did you like school, Creasy?
L366397 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ That's right.
L366396 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ We're taking a different way home.
L366372 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
L366371 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
L366370 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Time will tell.
L366369 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
L366368 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ I'm a bargain.
L366367 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Someone gave him more money than we could.
L366366 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
L366365 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
L366364 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
L366363 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Potential? I don't understand.
L366362 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ I'm looking for potential.
L366361 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Why not?
L366360 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ No.
L366359 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
L366358 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ No.
L366355 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ I know. But which state?
L366354 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ The United States.
L366353 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Where are you from, Creasy?
L366338 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Creasy...
L366337 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
L366336 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
L366334 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ My last bodyguard. He drove me to school in the morning and picked me up in the afternoon.
L366333 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Who's Emilio?
L366332 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him with when he left.
L366329 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Frank only responds to commands in German. He was trained in Frankfurt. My Dad loves the idea of having a dog around, but hates the fact he lives inside.
L366328 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
L366327 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
L366326 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ If they like me.
L366325 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
L367069 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
L367068 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Creasy... Wait.
L367067 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Then don't come.
L367066 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ You're lying. I don't believe you.
L367065 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
L367064 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I don't believe you.
L366971 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ An autosequestra. Kalfus arranged for Pinta to be taken to a safehouse. I'm sure he thought she'd sit there for three days eating pizza and watching TV. It didn't work out that way. Everything got fucked up when I killed the cops and Tazinari saw an opportunity.
L366970 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Planned what?
L366969 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
L366758 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Because...  I was already dead.
L366757 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
L366466 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier.
L366465 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Jordan!
L366452 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ The traffic takes some getting used to.
L366451 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Sorry.
L366435 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Please, it's Lisa... I'll be coming with you tomorrow. I have lunch with friends.
L366434 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
L366433 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ It makes it all seem so serious.
L366431 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that.
