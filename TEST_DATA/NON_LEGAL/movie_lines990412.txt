L597562 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ You don’t say.
L597561 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ You’re wrong about my being there, though. Carlos borrowed my car that day, his had broken down...  Leon saw it, like you, assumed I was there, thought he’d wait to ask for a lift. But Carlos turned up, with the tape you found...  Leon got his lift, and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out. He watched it, confronted Carlos, threatened to tell the police about the hotel... I don’t know how he knew about the hotel. Perhaps Carlos talked too much... My husband did not tell me... You more or less guessed the rest...  I didn’t know any of this before you left for Los Angeles.
L597558 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Oh no. At long last Leon had found a mission. He’d never have killed himself when glory beckoned. Your husband killed your brother. And thanks to you, almost got me killed too.
L597557 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Leon could still have hung himself.
L597556 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Kids are not your thing, Deborah. You’d have been ready for me when I turned up with ‘Sleeping Beauty’. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. “Not Leon,” you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didn’t say ‘My God!’, or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. “Not Leon.” Who then?  You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman I’d stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at £15,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didn’t you?
L597555 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why don’t you accuse me of killing my brother?
L597554 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Your brother stumbled upon Adonis’s little secret, didn’t he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more.  Leon didn’t come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kid’s life. Your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldn’t be concealed, hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? “Leon does his own prints. Wouldn’t want anyone to interfere with his ‘Art’”.  I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps it’s the way you say them...
L597552 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Not in the strict sense of the word, no. He was in too much of a hurry to kill me when we first met and too wasted in acid when I caught up with him later.
L597551 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ ...You-you spoke to him?
L597550 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldn’t have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.
L597548 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Leon didn’t hang himself, Deborah. Your husband killed him and made his death look like suicide. How did he do it, eh? Strangulation? Drugs? No doubt an autopsy will tell.
L597547 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Leon hung himself...
L597546 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Leon’s not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leon’s found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned I’d exceeded his expectations.
L597545 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Leon hung himself...
L597544 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Adonis thought your brother’s body’d be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didn’t he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
L597543 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Leon hung himself.
L597542 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? He’s a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
L597541 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ My brother hung himself.
L597540 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ What do you mean, ‘No’, Mrs De Moraes?
L597539 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ No!
L597538 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?
L597534 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ It must be tough being married to Adonis to end up sleeping alone every night. Sleep must be hard coming. What’s harder? The thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if? Or imagining what he does with his children?
L597533 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ How... When did you...
L597532 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
L597531 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Huh! Don’t you recall convincing me he had?  You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.
L597530 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ You knew he had nothing to do with your brother’s disappearance, didn’t you?
L597529 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Whatever the reason, I’m sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.
L597527 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I guess the news you’d sent me after Friedman didn’t go down too well, eh?
L597526 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ You do have a vivid imagination, Mr Lombard. I only wish you’d use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. I fail to understand your purpose in this. Still, say what you’re owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right?
L597525 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ When did you learn about his taste for kids, huh? On your honeymoon? Or was it later, when bitterness set in and you turned against your beloved but weak little brother? How did you find out? Did he confess? Try to convert you perhaps? Or was it woman’s intuition? Or just the way he fucked you?
L597524 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Have you finished?
L597523 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ You know he’d have had him killed, don’t you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
L597522 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Why... I don’t know what you’re talking about.
L597521 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I’ve had a long and unpleasant day. I’m tired and I’m angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leon’s boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why haven’t you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
L597520 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ You’re mad...
L597519 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ How did you break into my office, Deborah? Ladies of your standing don’t learn to pick locks between shopping trips.  Come on, Deborah! Acting dumb doesn’t suit you! Who knew I’d found dirt on your brother, huh? Who knew it was in an envelope? Taking me for dead, who’d want to make sure it didn’t fall into the wrong hands?
L597518 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT?
L597517 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
L597516 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you can’t satisfy him?
L597515 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ What’s in the bag? Underwear? To seduce your husband? Or is it for your own recreation?  Tell me, how come such a handsome couple sleep in seperate bedrooms? Is it because he does it with little children?
L597514 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Sorry?
L597513 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Black suits you.
L597512 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ I... If you don’t mind, I do not think he matters now. It... Things turned out to be as we thought; Leon was weak. There’s no point in delving into his sad life anymore. Now, will you please tell me how much we owe you?
L597511 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Aren’t you curious to know about Friedman?
L597510 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ I... Well, we’re burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but it’s late and with the funeral...
L597509 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ You’re repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
L597508 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ I’m really sorry you were not called...
L597505 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Why don’t you ask when I left the Mondrian?
L597504 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ When did you get back?
L597503 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
L597502 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Mr Lombard...
L597169 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De Moraes...
L597168 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...
L597154 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Yeah. Goodnight, Mrs De Moraes.
L597153 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Paul Lamont...?
L597152 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. I’ll give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
L597151 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Yes... You woke me up... It’s the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
L597150 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Are you all right?
L597149 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ ...7548. Have you... Have you found him yet?
L597148 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
L597147 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Just a moment...  Go ahead.
L597146 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Have you got a pen?
L597145 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Mr Lombard?
L597103 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ You do want me to keep the job, don’t you, Mrs De Moraes?
L597102 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.
L597100 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?
L597099 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Minimizes the risks. Children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses. These can also be used to move women and drugs... Anything that makes money really.
L597098 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ The hotels are useful capital investments. The kids liquid assets. My guess is they own hotels across the globe, and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot.
L597097 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Huh! Really? Hotels?
L597096 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people don’t just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. They’re in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
L597095 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Are we understood?
L597092 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:...  Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight I’m convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.
L597091 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ I’m impressed. That information could have cost me £20,000.
L597090 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ The man who sold the boy to your brother.
L597089 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Who is Friedman?
L597088 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
L597087 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ You lost my money?
L597085 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
L597084 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?
L596937 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ You drive a hard bargain.
L596936 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ I still don’t buy your story but I figured it can’t do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry. Besides, if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner, we could always get the right people onto you. I trust you know who I am talking about.
L596927 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Couldn’t Nazi hunters do the job?
L596926 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
L596925 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
L596924 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.
L596923 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
L596922 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Laurence!
L596921 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ No. You’re fired! Get out of my house. And take your sick tape with you...
L596920 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Perhaps I should come back when you’re...
L596919 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Get out of my house. You’re fired, Mr Lombard.
L596918 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Excuse me?
L596917 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ No. The question now is how long it’s going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
L596916 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
L596915 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ How dare you...  You don’t know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
L596913 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Look, Mrs De Moraes, however much of a let down it might be, your brother’s not back to his old weekend tricks! Impressionable as he is, he probably grew tired of healthy girls in grisly poses, tried moving on to bigger things, came upon more than he’d bargained for and somehow fancied he could take on the real world. Which he no doubt chanced upon on his way to that thing now sitting on your table... Have a look at it, Mrs De Moraes. I told you I had bad news...
L596912 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Oh no. You’ll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
L596911 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I can’t tell you that yet. But he’s being well looked after.
L596910 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
L596909 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
L596908 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I need the money to smooth my way, you understand? Now, have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning?
L596907 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Excuse me?
L596906 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise.  You don’t mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is he’s either on the run, held captive, or dead.  I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But I’ve seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why I’m here at such a late hour. I need £20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.
L596905 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ What... What are you talking about?
L596904 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ You seem surprised. Could it be you don’t think that badly of him after all?  You needn’t worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.
L596903 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ There’s more. Your brother also purchased a young boy for £15,000.
L596902 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ You... You found that at Leon’s?
L596901 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ It’s a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. I’m told it retails at around £4,000.  I see you don’t require a definition.
L596900 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Disney! How inter...
L596899 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I found this at your brother’s.
L596898 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Anything is possible.
L596897 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Can it be that you want your brother found?
L596896 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Can it be that easy?
L596895 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
L596894 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Oh-oh! Touché, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh?  No. Don’t. You might get confused speaking of things you don’t understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until you’ve done what we are paying you for.
L596893 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I don’t know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
L596892 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
L596891 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I’m afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brother’s in trouble.
L596890 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ I won’t comment on the time but you’ll understand if I don’t tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard. 
L596689 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Was it cash, Mr De Moraes?  The £1,000. You gave it to him in cash?
L596688 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Perhaps it wasn’t so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
L596687 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
L596686 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
L596685 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
L596676 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Well, Leon does not need money for prints, Mr Lombard. Does his own printing. Wouldn’t want anyone to interfere with his ‘Art’!  Which, as he subsequently vanished, raises the question: what was the money for? Perish the thought.
L596675 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ And that is the last time any...
L596674 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Three weeks ago. To borrow money. I wasn’t here but he got to my husband, sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made. Carlos handed over £1,000 to get rid of him.
L596667 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ That depends what you’re looking at.
L596666 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
L596665 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Now you know why you’re here, Mr Lombard.  It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people of a certain standing.
L596765 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Can you tell me how you spell...
L596764 +++$+++ u8293 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DIRECTORY ENQUIRIES OPERATOR +++$+++ Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
L596763 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ A call box? That’s odd. Where exactly?
L596762 +++$+++ u8293 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DIRECTORY ENQUIRIES OPERATOR +++$+++ There’s nothing wrong with the line, sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box.

L597163 +++$+++ u8294 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EFFEMINATE WAITER +++$+++ Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe.  So, black coffee and a couple of crescents.
L597162 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ The word for those things is croissants.
L597160 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Croissants. Like that...
L597159 +++$+++ u8294 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EFFEMINATE WAITER +++$+++ I’m sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
L597158 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Croissants.
L597157 +++$+++ u8294 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EFFEMINATE WAITER +++$+++ Crow what?
L597156 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ A coffee and a couple of croissants.
L597155 +++$+++ u8294 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EFFEMINATE WAITER +++$+++ Good morning, sir. How can I help you?
L597437 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ Huh! And they say charity’s only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah...  Christ...
L597436 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Nothing sticks to slime, Emily.  This should cover what you lent me.
L597420 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I can... The question is, can you lie to your ex- husband?
L597419 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
L597418 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ They’d never let me go. And you’d end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.
L597416 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ My ex-husband. My work drove him away. Made his life a misery. He thinks I’m obsessed, punishing myself for what happened to our son.  But he’s a good guy. He’ll listen to you. He won’t turn you in if I ask him not to. I can pretty much guarantee that. Okay?
L597415 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ What about your friendly cop?
L597414 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ ...I’m Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this that’s who I am. Do you get what I’m fucking saying, Mr Lombard?
L597411 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ It’s up to you whether they walk or not.
L597410 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ Damn it! You can’t fucking walk away from this!
L597408 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For god’s sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
L597407 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Then find another way.
L597406 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think I’ll get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, it’ll be too late.
L597405 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I’m finished here and I’m tired, Emily. You shouldn’t be here. Now don’t make it worse.
L597404 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ That-that won’t do. That’s not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, that’s the way...
L597403 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?
L597402 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Do you know a friendly cop?
L597401 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ We’re both thinking the same thing, right?
L597400 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ No one saw me but the Italian and a dog. I blew up their generator. They thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing. It might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up...
L597399 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Who knows. Who cares...  You wanted slime. You got slime.
L597398 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ Italian? The Mafia...?
L597397 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Some Italian I picked up back there. He’s in the boot of the Mustang.
L597396 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ So who... Who’s the man? Where is he?
L597395 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Friedman’s dead... They killed him...
L597394 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ What...  Some kind of organ factory... Pregnant girls doped up. Babies. There’s a lot of people back there. They’re holding a seminar. Trafficking’s the past, breeding the future...
L597393 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ What...?
L597391 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Who’s the guy? Who’s the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate I’d have had to kill him.
L597390 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ Look, you don’t tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldn’t imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Who’s the guy? The Austrian?
L597340 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I think so. And if it comes to it, tell the cops anything you think will make them move. Whatever you came up with couldn’t come close to how bad it is. Bye now.
L597339 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ Have you found your man? Is that where he is?
L597338 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. There’s a dirt track with a ‘Closed to the public’ sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you haven’t heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?
L597337 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
L597336 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Get a pen and don’t ask any questions.
L597304 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Burn the passport and keep the money. Think of it as a donation to the cause...
L597303 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ What am I to do with the packages if...
L597298 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ Don’t fall asleep with your hair wet.
L597297 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
L597296 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ Right... Well, I’ll get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
L597295 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Thank you. But I think I’ll go to bed. It’s been a long day.
L597294 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ A little too tight, eh?  ...They were my son’s. Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy...  I... There’s some cold chicken salad in the fridge if you’re hungry.
L597287 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didn’t I hear you right?
L597286 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...
L597285 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ Did you not enter this country illegally?
L597284 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ A criminal?
L597283 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ It’s give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need help, we need information. You didn’t really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you?
L597275 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Did you call me up here to enjoy yourself, Emily, or to let me use your phone? Because we seem to have a slight problem...
L597274 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ How come you’re alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
L597273 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what we’re doing here?
L597272 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ Like you’ll find a way to stop your Austrian killing you a second time round?
L597271 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I’m sure I’ll find a way.
L597270 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ No answer. You have no passport and your Embassy’s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
L597269 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Hah... What about Nathalie?
L597268 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ A recent acquisition. We’ve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard.  I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flat’s been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.
L597267 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I wouldn’t mind. Thank you.
L597266 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ There’ve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation. Officially, it’s just not called for. Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee?
L597257 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ I might come back, I might not. But if I do, it won’t be for a couple of hours.
