L194051 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ May I help you?
L194637 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
L194636 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ What's wrong with me?
L194574 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
L194573 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
L194572 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
L194571 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I'm so excited. Yay!
L194555 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit.
L194554 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
L194553 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
L194552 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
L194551 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Come up to Boston with me?
L194550 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
L194549 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Oh, Tangerine.
L194548 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
L194547 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Oh, baby, what's going on?
L194334 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ In the world.
L194333 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ In the room?
L194332 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
L194329 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
L194328 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ You rat.
L194327 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
L194326 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Come over after I'm done here?
L194325 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I was not.
L194324 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ You were not.
L194323 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the neighborhood.
L194089 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
L194088 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?
L194087 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
L194086 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
L194085 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
L194083 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ Well, why don't you tell me what's going on? Do you mind if I turn this on?
L194082 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Okay, I guess.
L194081 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ How are you today?
L195101 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I just wanted to say that. Come by my house.
L195100 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
L195099 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
L195098 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I can't stop thinking about you.
L195097 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock."
L195072 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ We should have sex. It's old hat for us.
L195071 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
L195070 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
L195069 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
L195068 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Doesn't sound like me.
L195067 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I don't know.
L195066 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
L195065 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
L195064 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
L195063 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
L195062 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ A bully? Moi?
L195061 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Says you were a bully...
L195060 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.
L195045 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you.
L195044 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Well, you obviously don't know me.
L195043 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
L195042 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I'm nervous, too.
L195041 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ -- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
L195040 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Hey, Joel --
L195039 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
L195038 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ That's okay. I --
L195037 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
L195036 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Oh, um...
L195035 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Have sex. Y'know --
L195034 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Make love?
L195033 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Listen, did you want to make love?
L195032 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Joel, come here. Please.
L195031 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I think I should go back.
L195030 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ What if?
L195029 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I don't know. What if it breaks?
L195026 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I don't know.
L195025 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
L195000 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Yeah.
L194999 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
L194998 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Tomorrow?
L194997 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ When?
L194996 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Yeah.
L194995 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ So you'll call me, right?
L194947 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I love you.
L194946 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Bye, Joel.
L194945 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Come back and make up a good-bye at least. Let's pretend we had one.
L194944 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
L194943 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ What if you stay this time?
L194942 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.
L194941 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ So go.
L194938 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ No, it's our house! Just tonight --  -- we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which one do you want to be? I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible.  Alcohol! You make drinks. I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth. I'm ruthless at the moment.
L194937 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I think we should go.
L194936 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
L194935 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Naomi.
L194934 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
L194933 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ It's dark.
L194932 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
L194931 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I knew.
L194929 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.
L194928 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
L194927 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.
L194924 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ It's freezing out here.
L194923 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ What are you doing?
L194922 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Cool.
L194921 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ At least I haven't been barking up the wrong tree.
L194920 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Female.
L194919 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Male or female?
L194918 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Oh.
L194917 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I do sort of live with somebody though.
L194916 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Let's move into this neighborhood.
L194915 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Um, no.
L194914 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I wish we did. You married?
L194913 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it.  Look, houses in which we don't live.
L194912 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
L194911 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...
L194910 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Yeah, maybe.
L194909 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Seems too coincidental that way.
L194908 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I think, before.
L194907 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
L194906 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Me too. There's this poem --
L194905 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I think she's great.
L194904 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
L194903 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I love her.
L194902 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
L194901 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Okay.
L194900 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
L194899 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ yeah?
L194898 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
L194897 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I don't think I've slept in a year.
L194896 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ But my sleeping is really fucked up.
L194895 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
L194894 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
L194891 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
L194890 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ What do we do?
L194889 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I know.
L194888 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.
L194887 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll. I think your name is magic.
L194886 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Yeah, like that.
L194885 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?
L194882 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I'm Joel.
L194881 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Oh God, how horrid.
L194878 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
L194877 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
L194876 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ You said --
L194875 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
L194874 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ You know what I did.
L194869 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?
L194868 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
L194867 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
L194866 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
L194865 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ You said...
L194863 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Hi.
L194862 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Hi there.
L194822 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can.
L194821 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
L194820 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I know.
L194819 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
L194818 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Probably.
L194817 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ You had the whole human race pegged.
L194816 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I had you pegged, didn't I?
L194815 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I remember that speech really well.
L194814 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.
L194812 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.
L194811 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Okay.
L194810 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
L194809 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Not yet. Not married.
L194808 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Well, you're married.
L194807 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I'd like to... take you out or something.
L194806 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Yeah?
L194805 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
L194804 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.
L194788 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I did it. I guess that means something.
L194787 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Is that what you want?
L194786 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I told her today I need to end it.
L194768 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
L194767 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ It's very late.
L194766 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Come up and see me... now.
L194765 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I dropped you off after. You said --
L194764 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ And I didn't have an argument.
L194763 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ So what. Infatuation is good, too.
L194762 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
L194761 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I was so nervous. I remember I couldn't think of anything to say. There were long silences.
L194760 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ But you weren't. I could tell.
L194759 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I'm sure, I said.
L194758 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
