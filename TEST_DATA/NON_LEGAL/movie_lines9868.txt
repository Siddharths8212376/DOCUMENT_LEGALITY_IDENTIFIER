L248967 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What bag?
L248966 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ My bag. My bag.
L248957 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Get inside!
L248956 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What are you gonna do?
L248955 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Go inside. I'll be right there.
L248934 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ They don't feel like you're in construction.
L248933 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I'm in construction.
L248932 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What do you do?
L248927 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.
L248926 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What're you doing? What about the car?
L248921 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right?
L248920 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Talk? To you? After what you did!
L248919 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.
L248918 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Take it easy.  We can talk about it.
L248917 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Liar!
L248916 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week.
L248909 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I couldn't wait to get away. I was ordering the dessert when they were eating dinner. When they were having coffee, I was asking for a check.
L248908 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
L248907 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
L249422 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I want you and Anthony to go down there and take care of that bastard. Without him, they've got no case.
L249421 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Yeah.
L249420 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
L249419 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Yeah.
L249418 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
L249417 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ How?
L249416 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I think you got a good shot at beating the case.
L249415 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.
L249414 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I can't eat,  just get me some coffee.
L249304 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Right away I knew he didn't want them. I knew I was going to get stuck for the money. I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them. And now, he didn't want them. I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed he didn't even say goodbye.
L249303 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ What fucking good are these things? They don't fit. What do I need this for? I'm not paying for this shit.
L249295 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.
L249294 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I better call again.
L249293 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Nah.
L249292 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ You want the melon?
L249285 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.
L249284 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
L249283 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
L249282 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Watch this.
L249281 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.
L249280 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What'll I tell Fran?
L249264 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him.
L249263 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Paulie's gonna make him?
L249258 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ So what?  Where are they gonna go?
L249257 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ There are cops all over the place.
L249256 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Don't worry about it.
L249255 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
L249254 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Oh yeah? Anything you say.
L249252 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Have a drink first.
L249251 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I gotta talk to you.
L249250 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Give'm a drink.
L249237 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ We did it.  We did it.
L249236 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Jimmy.
L249235 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.
L249098 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ We only have to shove'em over the moat.
L249097 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
L249096 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
L249050 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Fuck Paulie. If Batts' crew finds we whacked him, we got real problems.
L249049 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
L249048 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ It's still better than letting somebody find him.
L249047 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ It's been six months.
L249046 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
L249045 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What?
L249044 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Well, we gotta dig him up again.
L249043 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Paulie was just talking about him.
L249042 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?
L248951 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Jimmy. He'll be okay. He's good for it. Relax.
L248950 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ You got money for your bullshit television, don't you?  I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money?
L248853 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city.  He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what he really loved to do was steal.  I mean, he actually enjoyed it.  Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.  He was one of the city's biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They went fast.
L248852 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Keep 'em coming.
L248788 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
L248787 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
L249234 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Marty, please. Let me talk to him.
L249233 +++$+++ u5596 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.
L249232 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ He heard.
L249231 +++$+++ u5596 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ I want to talk to Jimmy.
L249181 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Will you stop.

L249178 +++$+++ u5596 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ It's a fait accompli?
L248947 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.
L248946 +++$+++ u5596 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.
L248847 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.  I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.
L248846 +++$+++ u5601 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ TODDY +++$+++ I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy. :
L248845 +++$+++ u5601 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ TODDY +++$+++ You're some fucking jerk.
L248844 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
L248822 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me.
L248821 +++$+++ u5601 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ TODDY +++$+++ Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?
L248820 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I can't make any more deliveries.
L248819 +++$+++ u5601 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ TODDY +++$+++ What happened to you?

L249350 +++$+++ u5593 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.

L249396 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Did he say what they're asking him about?
L249395 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ He's okay. They sobered him up.
L249394 +++$+++ u5592 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
L248982 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Stayed out? Daddy never went out at all.
L248981 +++$+++ u5595 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN'S MOTHER +++$+++ Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
L248980 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
L248979 +++$+++ u5595 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN'S MOTHER +++$+++ Driving you crazy?  Don't get me started.  You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all. What kind of people are these?

L248974 +++$+++ u5595 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN'S MOTHER +++$+++ If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
L248973 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
L248972 +++$+++ u5595 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN'S MOTHER +++$+++ What kind of person doesn't call?
