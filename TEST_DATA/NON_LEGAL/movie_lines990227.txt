L460606 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Who?
L460605 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,
L460600 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I'm afraid it's my fault. I made her feel guilty this morning --  Brother, what are you doing up?
L460599 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
L460598 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ It's twenty after one.
L460567 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Fine.
L460566 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ How is she?
L460552 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Better off? How could she ever find love and happiness, if you did what you're talking about? Are you insane?
L460551 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
L460550 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
L460549 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, I... I hadn't thought about it that much. I was thinking... well, it's an idea, the girl is oversexed, and...
L460548 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?
L460547 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
L460546 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I thought I knew you. I thought I knew you better, I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. Well, I can't believe what I've just heard in this room. A defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. How could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man?
L460542 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Over... my... dead... body!
L460541 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!
L460522 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Honey, that's no way to talk to the Doctor, he's merely doing his job, dear.
L460521 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ This conversation is making me a little sick.
L460501 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition. I wash my hands or the whole thing.
L460500 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied?
L460495 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ She doesn't have to take her panties off, we can see her stomach with 'em on. All she has to do is pull up her dress and let us see her belly.
L460494 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Honey!
L460485 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I forgot that Rose will lie like a child. She's no more pregnant than I am, she just doesn't want to go to that farm!
L460484 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What did you forget?
L460483 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No forwarding address, huh?  In the shock of this brilliant move, I forgot something.
L460479 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ But she must know... unless... unless... Rose, was there more than one person?
L460478 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ She already told you, she doesn't know.
L460477 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
L460476 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do?
L460473 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?
L460472 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.
L460461 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!
L460460 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
L460459 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!
L460458 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word "farm" means to her?
L460457 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!
L460456 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Honey, Rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. Now I don't think --
L460448 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Something has got to be done or Rose is going to be in this house forever.
L460447 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
L460446 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Her plan is obvious, plain as day. She's going on a hunger strike. The question is, how do we foil her?
L460444 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ No, she doesn't, she's fine, fine. She's perfectly healthy, don't give her ideas.
L460443 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ She does look a little peaky.
L460438 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ The hell we can't.
L460437 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
L460436 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ It has been three weeks since I "fired" her. Is there no way to get rid of this girl? Are we stuck with her for life?
L460408 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?
L460407 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ She hasn't actually done anything...
L460391 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Um-hmm.  Come with me, Brother. I want to show you something.
L460390 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ She's like a different person. Being so sick made a big impression on her. I really think she's learned a lesson.
L460372 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Sometimes the negativism and cynicism in you makes me want to vomit.  Your real trouble is that you're anti-intellectual. The irony is women are supposed to be emotional, but I never saw anybody who depended more on emotion and prejudice than you do.
L460371 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I don't care where the polecat studied.
L460370 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a rascal, he's one of the finest physicians in Glenville. He studied at Johns Hopkins University.
L460350 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I don't see how you can even think of it now.
L460349 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed.  I hope she'll be all right, but I still think we ought to fire her.
L460348 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ He's a polecat, dear.
L460347 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
L460346 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
L460336 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Honey, please...
L460335 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Excuse me, sir, are you calling my wife a liar?
L460315 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I'll talk to her, I'll reason with her.
L460314 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Darlin', Rose has got to go!
L460313 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative.
L460312 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ They follow her because she's a --  -- no, I won't say that.
L460311 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.
L460310 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, I have a pretty good idea.
L460309 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ How could Rose really be a bad influence on Dolly? She has a loving nature, you ought to want someone like that around your children. Why do you think those boys and men like her?
L460306 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it...
L460305 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
L460304 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.
L460303 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.
L460302 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Who is to say our morals are better than hers?  But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...
L460301 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ It's because of the children she's got to go. I don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. Morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house.
L460300 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.
L460299 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I'm sorry, darlin', I hate it as much as you do.
L460238 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, that's very reasonable. Howe I hate to bring it up, but she's got an awful toothache, we've got to carry her to the dentist.
L460237 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.
L460236 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
L460235 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
L460234 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
L460233 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Now you listen to me, Rose --
L460229 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I don't intend to mock you, dear. I respect your philosophy. It's beyond my comprehension, but I respect it.
L460228 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
L460227 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
L460226 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
L460225 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Boys? You say to me boys?
L460224 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
L460223 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ -- I am not responsible for her epizootics and I did not bring about her epizootics. Now listen to me. When I have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --
L460222 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Darlin', it is not my fault if the girl has epizootics --
L460221 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
L460220 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I am not being brutal to her!
L460219 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
L460218 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Oh, shut up, Rose. Shut your mouth and quit crying!
L460187 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe.
L460186 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon.
L460184 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Rose, my patience is wearing thin. First a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away. This is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show.
L460183 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.
L460164 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Yes, darlin', time will tell.
L460163 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, time will tell, won't it?
L460162 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
L460161 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
L460160 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ No reason at all, darlin'.
L460159 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
L460157 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I don't see any bruises or broken bones.
L460156 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Is she all right?
L460155 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Quarter of twelve.
L460154 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What time is it?
L460153 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, she's back.
L460128 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Yes, of course.
L460127 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.
L460126 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
L460125 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
L460124 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, she loves children, all right.  She loves everybody.
L460123 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
L460122 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
L460121 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
L460120 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ She will succeed.
L460119 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.
L460118 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ The girl worries me. If she walks down the street like that, an army will be following her.
L460117 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose and tease her like that. Of course her clothes are silly, but she's ignorant, naive, she doesn't know any better.
L460111 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer.
L460110 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.
L460109 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ You're not having lunch?
L460108 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Who doesn't have such thoughts?  We'd better get going.
L460107 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
L460106 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ They'll put her in jail. The damn little fool might as well be naked.
L460099 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I'll take him with me downtown.  And you, too, Rose, if you want a ride.
L460098 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
L460097 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Lay off of that stuff, son. It upsets your mother.
L460087 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Why, they won't either. She looks pretty. And I wish you wouldn't pick on the poor girl all the time. Don't listen to him, Rose, you look pretty, even beautiful.
L460086 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Um-hmm. Well, that is the damndest outfit I ever saw in my life. You walk down the street like that and they'll put you in jail, Rose.
L460005 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep.
L460004 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?
L459891 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ All right, darlin'.
L459890 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.
L459889 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I'll drive you, darlin'. You've got no business behind the wheel of an automobile. You don't think about what you're doing and you'll run into a telephone pole.
L459866 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ You're a wonderful woman, darlin'. As long as you're around, I'm sure the sun wouldn't dare go out.
L459865 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
L459864 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do.
L459863 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.
L459862 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.
L459861 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
L459860 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house.
L459859 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
L459858 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'.
L459850 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, she must have done something to encourage those scoundrels in Birmingham, even if she did run away from them.
L459849 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
L459848 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
L459847 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.
L459846 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
L459845 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
L459844 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
L459843 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Oh. Did you say something?
L459842 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
L459841 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What?
L459840 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Turn up your hearing aid.
L459839 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ What do you think of her, honey?
L459838 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
L459837 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ How goes it, darlin'?
L459836 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
L459835 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
L459796 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un hmmm.
L459795 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth.
L460575 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Nothing, Rose.
L460574 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
L460573 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Rose... I hate to be mean, but...  Oh, nevermind, forget it.
L460571 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, I'll pay you that back sometime, Mr. Hillyer.
L460570 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, we know you were there. The bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous.
L460569 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital.
L460568 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ You're looking very chipper this morning, Rose. Sow do you feel?
L460493 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ All right, damn it. We've seen you with your clothes off around here, stand up and pull up your dress and let's take a look!
L460492 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
L460491 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I don't believe it.
L460490 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.
L460489 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
L460488 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
L460487 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ No, you're not.
L460486 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, I am.
L460470 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Good God almighty. This is a catastrophe, they won't hire her.
L460469 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
L460468 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Your baby?
L460467 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Mine.
L460466 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ What baby? What baby? What baby are you speaking about?
L460463 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ What?
L460462 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.
L460455 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ No, no, not exactly. It isn't a farm in the sense that it's a farm. Not at all. It's a... dairy establishment. You'll 1ike it! I'm sure you'll like it because it's so... peaceful!
L460454 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You mean a farm?
L460453 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
L460452 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well. What kinda job is it?
L460451 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
L460450 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Tennessee?
L460449 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, I have got news! I called long distance and spoke to Cousin Hop and you'll be glad to know, Rose, I have found you a job!
L460442 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L460441 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ God forbid. You're not sick, Rose, forget it. Don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick.
L460435 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Mmm. Would you get me another half a-cup of coffee, dear?
L460434 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What's the use, there ain't none.
L460433 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, Rose, going out to look for a job today?
L460432 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Rose, darlin', you break my heart. But I am only a human man myself of the father variety. Rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired.
L460431 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me?
L460429 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
L460428 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
