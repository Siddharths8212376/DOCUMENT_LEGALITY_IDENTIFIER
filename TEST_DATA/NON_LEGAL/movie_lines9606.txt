L84679 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast.
L84678 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ Huh.
L84677 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ The man is a sex offender.  With a record.  Spent six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight- year-old.
L84676 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ Huh?
L84675 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude.
L84631 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Calmer than you are.
L84630 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
L84629 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
L84628 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ Well, just take 't easy, man.
L84627 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ That's your answer to everything, Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.
L84626 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ Just, just take it easy, Walter.
L84625 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Okay then.  We play Quintana and O'Brien next week.  They'll be pushovers.
L84624 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
L84623 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Am I wrong!
L84622 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ No, you're not wrong--
L84621 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, it's water under the bridge.  And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong?
L84620 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!
L84619 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ You mean--beyond pacifism?
L84618 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
L84617 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
L84616 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ Walter, you can't do that.  These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.
L84610 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ MARK IT ZERO!
L84609 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ Walter, they're calling the cops, put the piece away.
L84604 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain.
L84603 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ Hey Walter--
L84602 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.
L84598 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ This is a league game.  This determines who enters the next round- robin, am I wrong?
L84597 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ Come on Walter, it's just--it's Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game.
L84590 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over the line!
L84589 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ Hey man--
L84588 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
L84587 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck herself.  Why can't she board it?
L84586 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ What do you mean "brought it bowling"? I didn't rent it shoes.  I'm not buying it a fucking beer.  He's not gonna take your fucking turn, Dude.
L84585 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
L84584 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
L84583 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ What the fuck are you--
L84582 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
L84581 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
L84580 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ State of Israel.  If you will it, Dude, it is no--
L84579 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ Huh?
L84578 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Theodore Herzel.
L84577 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
L84576 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it is no dream.
L84488 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--

L84482 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Am I wrong!
L84481 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ No, but--
L84480 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
L84479 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ So who--
L84476 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ Walter, he peed on my rug--
L84475 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ What the fuck are you--
L84474 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--
L84473 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.  Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- American.  Please.
L84472 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
L84471 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Forget it, Donny.  You're out of your element.
L84468 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you talking--I'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here--
L84467 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ What's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about?
L84464 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ There's no fucking reason--here's my point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--
L84463 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ What's your point, Walter?
L84456 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ This was a valued, uh.
L84455 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
L84454 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ This was, uh--

Look, I don't wanna be a hard-on about this, and I know it wasn't your fault, but I just thought it was fair to tell you that Gene and I will be submitting this to the League and asking them to set aside the round.  Or maybe forfeit it to us--
L84431 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.

L84948 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ Well, okay, if you've already made out the check.  Brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside.
L84947 +++$+++ u4058 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ LEBOWSKI +++$+++ Brandt, give him the envelope.
L84944 +++$+++ u4058 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ LEBOWSKI +++$+++ No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.

L84651 +++$+++ u4058 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ LEBOWSKI +++$+++ It's funny.  I can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome.  I've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs.  What. . . What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski?
L84548 +++$+++ u4058 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ LEBOWSKI +++$+++ Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer! Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your answer to everything!

L84546 +++$+++ u4058 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ LEBOWSKI +++$+++ My wife is not the issue here. I hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame.  I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway. I can't solve your problems, sir, only you can.
L84545 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  I mean, if your wife owes--

L84539 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--

L84532 +++$+++ u4058 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ LEBOWSKI +++$+++ Did I urinate on your rug?
L84531 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ So you know they were trying to piss on your rug--
L84530 +++$+++ u4058 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ LEBOWSKI +++$+++ I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
L84529 +++$+++ u4057 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
L84528 +++$+++ u4058 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ LEBOWSKI +++$+++ You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?

L84596 +++$+++ u4065 +++$+++ m269 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ This is not Nam.  This is bowling. There are rules.

L86958 +++$+++ u4069 +++$+++ m270 +++$+++ BUCKY +++$+++ He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
L86957 +++$+++ u4070 +++$+++ m270 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ He's half yours, partner.
L86956 +++$+++ u4069 +++$+++ m270 +++$+++ BUCKY +++$+++ <i>You'll</i> take him.
L86955 +++$+++ u4070 +++$+++ m270 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ We'll take 'em in the morning.
L86954 +++$+++ u4069 +++$+++ m270 +++$+++ BUCKY +++$+++ Whatta we do about the Mex?
L86953 +++$+++ u4070 +++$+++ m270 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Wanna hear something more impressive? My first twenty fights were stumblebums handpicked by my manager. My girlfriend saw you fight a couple times over at the Olympic. Says maybe you <i>could</i> take me.
L86952 +++$+++ u4069 +++$+++ m270 +++$+++ BUCKY +++$+++ Impressive.
L86951 +++$+++ u4070 +++$+++ m270 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Tom here's my ninth hard felon of the month. Six weeks he'll be sucking gas. In three years I'll be working Central Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there wets his pants for fighters. Promised me the next spot he can wangle.
L86950 +++$+++ u4070 +++$+++ m270 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I came all the way down here same as you did.  Keep from gettin' killed. Happened to see those jarheads beatin' on a good collar--  Habla Ingles, Tomas?
L86949 +++$+++ u4069 +++$+++ m270 +++$+++ BUCKY +++$+++ You come all the way down here to roust--
L90110 +++$+++ u4076 +++$+++ m271 +++$+++ NYSSA +++$+++ I want to see the sun rise.
L90109 +++$+++ u4071 +++$+++ m271 +++$+++ BLADE +++$+++ What do you want me to do?
L90106 +++$+++ u4071 +++$+++ m271 +++$+++ BLADE +++$+++ Not good.
L90105 +++$+++ u4076 +++$+++ m271 +++$+++ NYSSA +++$+++ How does it look?
L90012 +++$+++ u4076 +++$+++ m271 +++$+++ NYSSA +++$+++ I don't understand.
L90011 +++$+++ u4071 +++$+++ m271 +++$+++ BLADE +++$+++ It means "bloodbrother."
L90003 +++$+++ u4071 +++$+++ m271 +++$+++ BLADE +++$+++ Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?
L90002 +++$+++ u4076 +++$+++ m271 +++$+++ NYSSA +++$+++ You're hurting me.
L90000 +++$+++ u4076 +++$+++ m271 +++$+++ NYSSA +++$+++ Well it's in mine, too.  I'm a pureblood.  I wasn't turned.  I was born this way.  Just like you.  Am I evil because I want to survive?  What about a wolf?  What about any predator?
L89999 +++$+++ u4071 +++$+++ m271 +++$+++ BLADE +++$+++ I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood.
L89998 +++$+++ u4076 +++$+++ m271 +++$+++ NYSSA +++$+++ Why do you hate us so much?
L89997 +++$+++ u4076 +++$+++ m271 +++$+++ NYSSA +++$+++ If that's true, then why'd you save me?
L89996 +++$+++ u4071 +++$+++ m271 +++$+++ BLADE +++$+++ Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
L89995 +++$+++ u4076 +++$+++ m271 +++$+++ NYSSA +++$+++ It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
L89994 +++$+++ u4071 +++$+++ m271 +++$+++ BLADE +++$+++ Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
L89993 +++$+++ u4076 +++$+++ m271 +++$+++ NYSSA +++$+++ Why?
L89992 +++$+++ u4071 +++$+++ m271 +++$+++ BLADE +++$+++ You don't want to go there.
