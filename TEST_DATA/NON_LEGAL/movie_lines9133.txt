L282393 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ No one knows you're here?
L282392 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ No.
L282292 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Are you?
L282291 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ He sees me as a threat.
L282289 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Go home.
L282288 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
L282287 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ You are being foolish.
L282286 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ I'd rather hear yours.
L282285 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
L282284 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ No.
L282283 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Have you gone to the police?
L282282 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
L282281 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ You?
L282280 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ What about me?
L282279 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
L282278 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ He was innocent.
L282277 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ That bothers you?
L282276 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
L282275 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Not your concern.
L282274 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ He called you "MacLeod".
L282273 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
L282272 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ What will you do now?
L282271 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ And you?
L282270 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ At the moment?  Carl Smith.
L282269 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Who is he?
L282268 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Dupont Circle.
L282267 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Where?
L282266 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ He tried to kill me last night.
L282117 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ What the hell is going on?
L282116 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Tradition.
L282115 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Why not?
L282114 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
L282113 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Jesus Christ.
L282093 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ I doubt that.  Good day, Miss Cartwright.
L282092 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ I have friends.
L282090 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Miss Cartwright, you are involving yourself in matters that do not concern you.  I strongly suggest you return to Washington and stay out of small town cemetaries.
L282089 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ I've been to Church Hill.
L282088 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ You have an active imagination.
L282087 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ I think you do.  Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that.
L282086 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.
L282085 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Does Carl Smith?
L282084 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ People like that rarely leave business cards.
L282083 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Who?
L282082 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Probably.
L282081 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Grave robbers?
L282080 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
L282079 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Someone beat you.
L281958 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Good day, Miss Cartwright.
L281957 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Good reflexes.
L281956 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ -All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please-
L281955 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
L281954 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Basil the II.
L281953 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Byzantine?
L281952 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Miss Cartwright, unless you have come here to sell the sword, there's very little I can help you with.  Now if you will excuse me, I have a great deal of work to do.
L281951 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
L281950 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ It's not mine.
L281949 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
L281948 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
L281947 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Very traditional.
L281946 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Yes.
L281945 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Do you play?
L282048 +++$+++ u1354 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ UNCLE JOE +++$+++ Call your mother.  You never call her.
L282047 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Thanks.
L282046 +++$+++ u1354 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ UNCLE JOE +++$+++ Forgers do it all the time.  They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D.  Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it.
L282045 +++$+++ u1354 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ UNCLE JOE +++$+++ Don't they have enough for you to do at the castle?
L282044 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Now there's a new topic.
L282043 +++$+++ u1354 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ UNCLE JOE +++$+++ Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.
L282040 +++$+++ u1354 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ UNCLE JOE +++$+++ You're never "just curious".  You've met my neice, Brenna.
L282039 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ I'm just curious.
L282038 +++$+++ u1354 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ UNCLE JOE +++$+++ Forget it.
L282386 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Don't be stupid, lady.  Your neck can be sliced as fast as anyone else's.
L282385 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Never take up poker, Detective.
L282384 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
L282383 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
L282382 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ What were you doing in Felton?
L282381 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ What's all of this got to do with me?
L282380 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
L282379 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ What makes you so sure he's the one?
L282378 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ I want Taupin.
L282377 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ You're an asshole, Moran.
L282376 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that.
L282375 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ It'll never stick.
L282374 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
L282373 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ What are you getting at, Moran?
L282372 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin.
L282371 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Spare me the details.
L282370 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ All fashionably without heads.
L282369 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Four?
L282368 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ What are you going to tell them?  That you're protecting a man who's killed four people?
L282367 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ We've got nothing to say.
L282366 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ You and I should talk first.
L282365 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ I'm calling an attorney.
L282364 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Well, the man of the hour that we all would like to talk to about now has apparently skipped town.  And all of a sudden the Smithsonian's ambulence chaser is an expert on missing persons.
L282363 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ What do you want from me?
L282362 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
L282361 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
L282360 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ A murder.
L282356 +++$+++ u1341 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ LIBRARIAN +++$+++ Not who.  What.  Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania.
L282355 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Who is it?
L282354 +++$+++ u1341 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ LIBRARIAN +++$+++ You always were hard to impress.
L282353 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
L282352 +++$+++ u1341 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ LIBRARIAN +++$+++ I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
L282351 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
L282350 +++$+++ u1341 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ LIBRARIAN +++$+++ Good way to lose your job.
L282347 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Yeah.
L282346 +++$+++ u1341 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ LIBRARIAN +++$+++ It's that important?
L282345 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Corey, you _owe_ me.
L282344 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ I'll take care of that Corey, but I need this now.
L282343 +++$+++ u1341 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ LIBRARIAN +++$+++ You talked to your supervisor lately?  He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight.  That on top of the cops bugging him.
L282342 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ All I need is for you to check the name.
L282341 +++$+++ u1341 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ LIBRARIAN +++$+++ Come on Brenna, your ass is already in a sling, don't drag me into it.
L281972 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Give it a rest Ned, huh?
L281971 +++$+++ u1350 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ SUPERVISOR +++$+++ You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
L281970 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two.
L281967 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?
L281966 +++$+++ u1350 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ SUPERVISOR +++$+++ Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here.
L281961 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ He's too cool.  Too sharp.  I think he's got something to do with it.
L281960 +++$+++ u1350 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ SUPERVISOR +++$+++ Why?
L281959 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ I don't believe him.
L281990 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ Stop!
L281989 +++$+++ u1352 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAVERN MAN #2 +++$+++ -In nomine sanctus esperitu-
L281988 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ Stop.
L281987 +++$+++ u1352 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAVERN MAN #2 +++$+++ -Auditorium nostrum-
L281986 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ Be quiet.
L281985 +++$+++ u1352 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAVERN MAN #2 +++$+++ -Luceat ei-
L281984 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ You'll not be bringing the church into this.
L281983 +++$+++ u1352 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAVERN MAN #2 +++$+++ -Et lux perpetua-
L281982 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ What are you doing man?
L281981 +++$+++ u1352 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAVERN MAN #2 +++$+++ Requiem acer'nam donaei-
L282333 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ I'll be back when I can.
L282332 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ Go ahead, Senor.  I have my friend to keep me company.
L282328 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ With the proper tools, Conor, a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one.
L282327 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ That is not me.
L282326 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
L282325 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ Of course.
L282324 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
L282323 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ I am not ready for this.
L282322 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.
L282321 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ And you?
L282320 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more.
L282319 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ But why be so concerned about me?
L282318 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned.
L282317 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ I feel hardly nothing.
L282316 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.
L282315 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ I do not think I like the sound of that.
L282314 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ As they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes.  To feel it, to know it, is to be in touch with the will of every living thing.
L282313 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that.
L282312 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf.
L282311 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.
L282310 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez.  We're raised as riders.
L282308 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed.
L282307 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
L282306 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
L282305 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ You have a gift.  One you must protect.
L282304 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ It's like to kill me first.
L282303 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ It will take less effort as you learn.
L282301 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ Muy Bien!
L282300 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ Impotent cow.
L282299 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ Oh, the boy has a mouth, now if only he had an arm.
L282298 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ Go to hell.
L282297 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
L282296 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ Again.  Try again.
L282295 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ Me arm hurts.
L282294 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ Harder.  Concentrate harder.
L282200 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts.
L282199 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ Why?
L282198 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help.
L282197 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ How can I stop such a man?
L282196 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ There is an imperfection.  For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat.  Then it is over.  The end.
L282195 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ But we cannot be killed.
L282194 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
L282193 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ Aye.
L282192 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
L282191 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ Why does he want to kill me?
L282190 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ Oh my God.  Oh my God I'm lost.
L282189 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod.
