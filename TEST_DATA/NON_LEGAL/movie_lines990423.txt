L601506 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ You got a system, Carver?
L601505 +++$+++ u8375 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ HOOKER +++$+++ 'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
L601504 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ Why don't ya then.
L601503 +++$+++ u8375 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ HOOKER +++$+++ Lucky, hell.  I could do it every day.
L601502 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ You're a lucky man, all right.
L601501 +++$+++ u8375 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ HOOKER +++$+++ Well, what did I tell ya?
L601473 +++$+++ u8375 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ HOOKER +++$+++ Give 'em a little time.
L601472 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ You really picked a winner, kid.
L601452 +++$+++ u8375 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ HOOKER +++$+++ I am after this race.
L601451 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ And you were gonna pay me back?
L601450 +++$+++ u8375 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ HOOKER +++$+++ This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got.
L601449 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.
L601448 +++$+++ u8375 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ HOOKER +++$+++ Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.
L601447 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ Get on with it then.
L601446 +++$+++ u8375 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ HOOKER +++$+++ I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
L601445 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ You should always look to the back too, kid.
L601423 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ If I'm not there by quarter of, I'm not coming.
L601422 +++$+++ u8375 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ HOOKER +++$+++ 660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
L601421 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ You're dreamin', kid.
L601420 +++$+++ u8375 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ HOOKER +++$+++ Maybe a couple million.
L601419 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
L601418 +++$+++ u8375 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ HOOKER +++$+++ If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.
L601417 +++$+++ u8375 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ HOOKER +++$+++ All you gotta do is place a bet for me at Shaw's place.  I'll supply all the money and the information.
L601416 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit in this state.
L601415 +++$+++ u8375 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ HOOKER +++$+++ I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
L601414 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ Why me?  Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from.
L601413 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ All right, then.
L601412 +++$+++ u8375 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ HOOKER +++$+++ Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar.  Can't see him till morning anyway.
L601411 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ What's the matter?  You gotta get back to Shaw?
L601409 +++$+++ u8375 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ HOOKER +++$+++ Cause I'm tired of bein' his nigger.  I want you to help me break him.
L601408 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ Then why the rat?
L601407 +++$+++ u8375 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ HOOKER +++$+++ So could Shaw.
L601406 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
L601405 +++$+++ u8375 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ HOOKER +++$+++ You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months.  He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.
L601404 +++$+++ u8375 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ HOOKER +++$+++ He hired a dame to take it from ya.
L601403 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ What do you mean?
L601402 +++$+++ u8375 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ HOOKER +++$+++ Yeh, he knows that.
L601401 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ He'll have to take a check.  I couldn't find my wallet.
L601400 +++$+++ u8375 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ HOOKER +++$+++ He cheats.
L601399 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.  How does he do it?
L601668 +++$+++ u8375 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ HOOKER +++$+++ Just as long as I get to finish the play.
L601667 +++$+++ u8382 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ POLK +++$+++ All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
L601666 +++$+++ u8375 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ HOOKER +++$+++ I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
L601665 +++$+++ u8382 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ POLK +++$+++ Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
L601664 +++$+++ u8375 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ HOOKER +++$+++ Will you wait until the chump is played?
L601662 +++$+++ u8382 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ POLK +++$+++ Like hell.  You won't even get a review till you're seventy.  And if the board starts to go soft, we'll let ya out in the yard some night with a hard-nose young bull who'll put fifty slugs in your face and ask what you were doin' there later.
L601661 +++$+++ u8375 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ HOOKER +++$+++ I'll make parole.
L601660 +++$+++ u8382 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ POLK +++$+++ You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?
L601659 +++$+++ u8375 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ HOOKER +++$+++ No.
L601658 +++$+++ u8382 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ POLK +++$+++ Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here.  All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird.  No questions, no court appearance, nothing.
L601657 +++$+++ u8382 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ POLK +++$+++ We'll get it, and if we can't, we'll just make it up.  Grand larceny, extortion.  Counterfeiting, anything you want.
L601656 +++$+++ u8375 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ HOOKER +++$+++ You got nothin' on me.
L601655 +++$+++ u8375 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ HOOKER +++$+++ Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.
L601654 +++$+++ u8382 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ POLK +++$+++ Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
L601653 +++$+++ u8375 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ HOOKER +++$+++ Don't think I know him.
L601652 +++$+++ u8382 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ POLK +++$+++ We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
L601651 +++$+++ u8375 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ HOOKER +++$+++ No.
L601650 +++$+++ u8382 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ POLK +++$+++ You want a drink or something?
L601719 +++$+++ u8387 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ TWIST +++$+++ On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.
L601718 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.
L601571 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya.
L601570 +++$+++ u8387 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ TWIST +++$+++ Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money.  We risk our whole operation for nothing.  I'll say when we make our bets.
L601567 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet.  Either way you end up with 40.
L601566 +++$+++ u8387 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ TWIST +++$+++ We were getting 50 from our guy.
L601565 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
L601564 +++$+++ u8387 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ TWIST +++$+++ On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
L601563 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
L601562 +++$+++ u8387 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ TWIST +++$+++ But who says you will.  I got a guy I can depend on.  He's liquidating everything he has for this.  You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.
L601561 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.
L601560 +++$+++ u8387 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ TWIST +++$+++ Can't do it.  There're telegraph inspectors all over the place.  I got 750 grand coming in from the coast, and I'm not gonna blow it for a lousy 14 gees.  We'll get somebody else to do our betting.
L601491 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ All right, get outa here.  You're outta work.
L601490 +++$+++ u8383 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ RILEY +++$+++ I don't know.  He took it hard.
L601489 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
L601488 +++$+++ u8383 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ RILEY +++$+++ There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there.  We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.
L601487 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ You weren't hired to miss him.
L601486 +++$+++ u8383 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ RILEY +++$+++ We missed him.
L601485 +++$+++ u8377 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ LONNEGAN +++$+++ All right, Riley.  What the hell happened?
L601281 +++$+++ u8381 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ Never heard of the place.
L601280 +++$+++ u8387 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ TWIST +++$+++ This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
L601279 +++$+++ u8381 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
L601278 +++$+++ u8387 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ TWIST +++$+++ I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
L601277 +++$+++ u8381 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ For fifteen years.
L601276 +++$+++ u8387 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ TWIST +++$+++ We'll take it.  You manage the building at the end of the alley?
L601592 +++$+++ u8382 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ POLK +++$+++ I think he will.
L601591 +++$+++ u8385 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ SNYDER +++$+++ He'll never do it.
L601590 +++$+++ u8382 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ POLK +++$+++ He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
L601589 +++$+++ u8385 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ SNYDER +++$+++ What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
L601588 +++$+++ u8382 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ POLK +++$+++ Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.
L601587 +++$+++ u8385 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ SNYDER +++$+++ Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
L601586 +++$+++ u8382 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ POLK +++$+++ Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
L601585 +++$+++ u8385 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ SNYDER +++$+++ Why don't you pick him up yourself?
L601584 +++$+++ u8382 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ POLK +++$+++ There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here.  We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold.  All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.
L601583 +++$+++ u8385 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ SNYDER +++$+++ Sure.  Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.
L601582 +++$+++ u8382 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ POLK +++$+++ Well we do.  He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
L601581 +++$+++ u8385 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ SNYDER +++$+++ Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
L601580 +++$+++ u8382 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ POLK +++$+++ Do ya know him or don't ya?
L601579 +++$+++ u8382 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ POLK +++$+++ Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try not to live up to all my expectations.  We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.
L601578 +++$+++ u8385 +++$+++ m568 +++$+++ SNYDER +++$+++ What is this?  I got work to do.
L603449 +++$+++ u8388 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ 1ST REPORTER +++$+++ We'll see you before you go.
L603448 +++$+++ u8400 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
L603447 +++$+++ u8388 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ 1ST REPORTER +++$+++ What's your next step, Nick?
L603445 +++$+++ u8400 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Sorry.  Don't know a thing.
L603444 +++$+++ u8388 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ 1ST REPORTER +++$+++ What about this Rosebreen?
L603439 +++$+++ u8400 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ No.
L603438 +++$+++ u8388 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ 1ST REPORTER +++$+++ Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
L602915 +++$+++ u8400 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I never tried to kid you reporters -- I'm telling you the truth.
L602914 +++$+++ u8388 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ 1ST REPORTER +++$+++ Come on, gimme a break.
L602913 +++$+++ u8400 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
L603021 +++$+++ u8393 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ GILBERT +++$+++ Of course.
L603020 +++$+++ u8388 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ 1ST REPORTER +++$+++ Is that what it means?
L603019 +++$+++ u8393 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ GILBERT +++$+++ Then just say he was sixty years old.
L603018 +++$+++ u8388 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ 1ST REPORTER +++$+++ You know how they are... sex...
L603017 +++$+++ u8393 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ GILBERT +++$+++ Why not?
L603016 +++$+++ u8388 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ 1ST REPORTER +++$+++ Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
L603015 +++$+++ u8393 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ GILBERT +++$+++ Yes.  He admitted it.
L603014 +++$+++ u8388 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ 1ST REPORTER +++$+++ He was?
L603013 +++$+++ u8393 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ GILBERT +++$+++ There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian.
L602665 +++$+++ u8391 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ He's just around the corner.
L602664 +++$+++ u8389 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Any luck?
L602631 +++$+++ u8391 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I can't find him.  I've tried everything.  I thought you might know.
L602630 +++$+++ u8389 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Now don't say that -- he's just off somewhere working.
L602612 +++$+++ u8391 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Just a minute...
L602611 +++$+++ u8389 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry....  What is it?
L602610 +++$+++ u8391 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ He's never forgotten a promise to me.  I'm worried about him.  I know something's happened to him.
L602609 +++$+++ u8389 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
L602608 +++$+++ u8391 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ But tonight is Christmas Eve!
L602607 +++$+++ u8389 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
L602606 +++$+++ u8391 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ It's all right.
L602605 +++$+++ u8389 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
L602602 +++$+++ u8391 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L602601 +++$+++ u8389 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Cheer up, darling.
L602514 +++$+++ u8389 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Oh.  I'll do my own typing!
L602513 +++$+++ u8391 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
L602512 +++$+++ u8389 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.
L602504 +++$+++ u8391 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Look -- those are the first metals that came through. 
L602503 +++$+++ u8389 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
L602645 +++$+++ u8400 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You better take a drink.
L602644 +++$+++ u8389 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Nothing.
L602643 +++$+++ u8400 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What?
L602642 +++$+++ u8389 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Do you suppose.....  ?
L602641 +++$+++ u8400 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Said he stole his invention.
L602640 +++$+++ u8389 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Why did that man want to kill him?
L602639 +++$+++ u8400 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
L602638 +++$+++ u8389 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ She's got me worrying, too.
L602468 +++$+++ u8406 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ WYNANT +++$+++ Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman... 
L602467 +++$+++ u8389 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Mind if I look around?
L602463 +++$+++ u8406 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ WYNANT +++$+++ And if it isn't?
L602462 +++$+++ u8389 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ That is, if it's all right with you.
L602461 +++$+++ u8406 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ WYNANT +++$+++ Well!
L602457 +++$+++ u8389 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ It's the same one.
L602456 +++$+++ u8406 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ WYNANT +++$+++ Another young man.
L602455 +++$+++ u8389 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ How are you?
L603585 +++$+++ u8391 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, Andy, Andy!
L603584 +++$+++ u8390 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Darling, don't cry.  Please.  I know it's terrible.  But isn't it really better this way?
L603516 +++$+++ u8391 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Why not?
L603515 +++$+++ u8390 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ You're high enough.
L603514 +++$+++ u8391 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?
L603327 +++$+++ u8391 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Go away!
L603326 +++$+++ u8390 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
L603325 +++$+++ u8391 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
L603324 +++$+++ u8390 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ You're talking like a crazy person,
L603323 +++$+++ u8391 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
L603322 +++$+++ u8390 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Dorothy!
L603321 +++$+++ u8391 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
L603320 +++$+++ u8390 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
L603319 +++$+++ u8391 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
L603318 +++$+++ u8390 +++$+++ m569 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Do you think I care
