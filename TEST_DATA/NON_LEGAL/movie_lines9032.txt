L162778 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ We are not stealing my mom's car.
L162777 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
L162776 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
L162754 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.
L162753 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...
L162740 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Weird...
L162739 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
L162738 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Whoa... she just farted.
L162737 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ I've been in love with her since the second grade.
L162736 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ That's Sherry VanHafton.
L162726 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Check!
L162725 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
L162678 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them.
L162677 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Yeah, she gives you shit and you take it.
L162674 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ YO, DOOFUS!
L162673 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Shit, that dork is Jam.
L162667 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
L162666 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.
L162915 +++$+++ u767 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Sure.
L162914 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
L162908 +++$+++ u767 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Oh, yeah...?
L162907 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
L162906 +++$+++ u767 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
L162905 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi.  So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it.
L162892 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?
L162891 +++$+++ u767 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Are you gettin' wise with me?
L162882 +++$+++ u767 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ And if it ain't cleaned off?
L162881 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Could be.
L162877 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Hey, disco dude, it's cool...
L162876 +++$+++ u767 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?
L163069 +++$+++ u773 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ SCALPER +++$+++ Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?
L163068 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
L163067 +++$+++ u773 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ SCALPER +++$+++ Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
L163066 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.
L163065 +++$+++ u773 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ SCALPER +++$+++ Guess you don't want to see the greatest show on earth. And in Detroit no less. Well, take care, chief.
L163064 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
L163063 +++$+++ u773 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ SCALPER +++$+++ You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.
L163062 +++$+++ u773 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ SCALPER +++$+++ The easy way.
L163061 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
L163060 +++$+++ u773 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ SCALPER +++$+++ Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
L163059 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Dude, this is all I got.
L163357 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ We all beat each other up, then, once we're nice and bruised, we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen. They gotta let us in then.
L163356 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Go ahead, Jam.
L163355 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.
L163038 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
L163037 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
L163036 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
L163035 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Wait! I know how we can get in!
L163024 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.
L163023 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ I got...
L163013 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.
L163012 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.
L163008 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels.
L163007 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ It was stolen!
L162995 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you?
L162994 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
L162993 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.
L162969 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.
L162968 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.
L162935 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
L162934 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
L162926 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again.
L162925 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.
L162873 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?
L162872 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?
L162831 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Check.
L162830 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?
L162686 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Check.
L162685 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
L162684 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.
L162681 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck's sake.
L162680 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ They're what?
L162679 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
L162642 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school.
L162641 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
L162640 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ I'm really sorry about that, man.
L162639 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Cool.
L162635 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Just check whatever you were wearing last night. Now!
L162634 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
L162633 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
L162632 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ What's gone?
L162631 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
L162630 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ It's my Bullworker.
L162629 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.
L162628 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Just listen up, man, cause we are in a quandary.
L162627 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Hawk?
L162626 +++$+++ u765 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Jam, listen up.
L163334 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!!
L163333 +++$+++ u771 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ MRS. BRUCE +++$+++ Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?
L163043 +++$+++ u771 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ MRS. BRUCE +++$+++ Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.
L163042 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Mom, what're we...?
L162747 +++$+++ u771 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ MRS. BRUCE +++$+++ If you truly are sorry, son, then you better pray like you've never prayed before. God willed me to find those tickets because He wanted to hear from you.  He knows you need help and He wants you to ask Him for it.
L162746 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ I said, I'm sorry!
L162745 +++$+++ u771 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ MRS. BRUCE +++$+++ What?!
L162744 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
L162743 +++$+++ u771 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ MRS. BRUCE +++$+++ Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you.
L162713 +++$+++ u771 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ MRS. BRUCE +++$+++ What else can I do? Oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets? TICKETS? Jeremiah, do you realize what this means? That you're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces! Now you want to see the devil in the flesh. You want to reach out and touch pure evil... and in Detroit no less!
L162712 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
L162711 +++$+++ u771 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ MRS. BRUCE +++$+++ I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.
L162664 +++$+++ u771 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ MRS. BRUCE +++$+++ You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.
L162663 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Grounded for the rest of the year?
L162662 +++$+++ u771 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ MRS. BRUCE +++$+++ Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
L162661 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ They're not idiots.
L162659 +++$+++ u771 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ MRS. BRUCE +++$+++ Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
L162658 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ But, mom!
L162657 +++$+++ u771 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ MRS. BRUCE +++$+++ It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
L162656 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
L162655 +++$+++ u771 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ MRS. BRUCE +++$+++ You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
L162654 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Ahh, sunshine.
L162653 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Uhh... nothing.
L162652 +++$+++ u771 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ MRS. BRUCE +++$+++ Jeremiah, what are you doing?
L162619 +++$+++ u771 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ MRS. BRUCE +++$+++ NOW!
L162618 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Oh, hi, mom.
L163235 +++$+++ u772 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.
L163234 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
L163233 +++$+++ u772 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ A bustier?
L163232 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that.
L163231 +++$+++ u772 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ Was it a teddy?
L163230 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
L163229 +++$+++ u772 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ Well? Continue! Continue!
L163228 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father. Built like you wouldn't believe. So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour.
L163227 +++$+++ u772 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
L163226 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.
L163225 +++$+++ u772 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ No...
L163224 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
L163223 +++$+++ u772 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.
L163170 +++$+++ u772 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while.
L163169 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ No.
L163168 +++$+++ u772 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
L163167 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Yeah.
L163166 +++$+++ u772 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ That's it?
L163165 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.
L163139 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy.
L163138 +++$+++ u772 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
L163137 +++$+++ u766 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ JAM +++$+++ Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time.
L163022 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo.
L163021 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ Twenty-five more'n I got.
L163011 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Okay, I'm just a little mad now! Jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place!?
L163010 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
L163009 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ But we took the keys?
L163006 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?
L163005 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ It's gone.
L162992 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
L162991 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?
L162963 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ Let's lift up her shirt.
L162962 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella.
L162867 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!
L162866 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!
L162812 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
L162811 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
L162797 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Hello summer detention.
L162796 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.
L162785 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
L162784 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ Simplicity, Hawk.
L162772 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." We're going this time and that's all there is to it.
L162771 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ The Chinese have a proverb: "That which appears too good to be true, usually is." There's gotta be a catch.
L162767 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ We won?!
L162766 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ I did it! I did it! We won!
L162733 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
L162732 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
L162731 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Trip, it's not the end of the world, okay? Quit acting all squeezed out.
L162730 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
L162729 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?
L162718 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
L162717 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!
L162683 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!
L162682 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?
L162671 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.

L162650 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ What?
L162649 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Trip, you fuckin' asshole.
L162646 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day.
L162645 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD.
L162644 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
L162643 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.
L162623 +++$+++ u768 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.
L162622 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.

L163151 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ Two hundred bucks?
L163116 +++$+++ u769 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LITTLE KID +++$+++ Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
L163115 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!
L163109 +++$+++ u769 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LITTLE KID +++$+++ It's not nearly enough, punk.

L163107 +++$+++ u769 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LITTLE KID +++$+++ A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
L163106 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ What do you want?
L163105 +++$+++ u769 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LITTLE KID +++$+++ Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.

L163102 +++$+++ u769 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LITTLE KID +++$+++ No really. My brother's hanging onto it for safe keeping. Please, let me get him for you.
L163101 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
L163100 +++$+++ u769 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ LITTLE KID +++$+++ Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
L163278 +++$+++ u775 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP +++$+++ Neither do I!
L163277 +++$+++ u770 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ MAN WITH COAT +++$+++ I don't even think you have a gun!
