L482274 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off?
L482273 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Standard vig.  Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
L482272 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ What're your taking down?
L482267 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ After that ass-whipping you gave me?
L482266 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne.
L482265 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Bubba.
L482264 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ This chink have a name?
L482263 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.
L482254 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
L482253 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ You think this is funny motherfucker?
L482251 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.
L482250 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
L482249 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Cut the shit, Flynne.
L482248 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I was trying to score some dope.
L482247 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Question is, what are you doing here?
L482246 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ What the hell are you doing here?
L482035 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Soon. I promise.  We'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear.  In the mean time, trust me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.
L482034 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ When?
L482033 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.
L482028 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Danny, he isn't gonna find out it's you.  Domingo was a slinger, he must have sold to hundreds of different people.
L482027 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man.
L482014 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Tell me what?
L482013 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ I was getting to it.
L482011 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Bobby laid his own tracks.  He could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. And as far as I'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him.  Now take the money.
L482010 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
L482009 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.
L482008 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You don't find that repugnant?
L482007 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself out of jail? I know the drill.
L482006 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Don't you wonder why I do it?
L482005 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ It's not my place.
L482004 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Thanks for not judging me.
L482003 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
L482002 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
L482001 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
L482000 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You think I'm a Judas?
L481966 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
L481965 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Danny, I'm touched.
L481964 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
L481963 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
L481962 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.
L481951 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ It was all pretty informal.  Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
L481950 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ No last name?
L481949 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
L481948 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ What?
L481947 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
L481946 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ You got a name?
L481945 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat.
L481944 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?
L481943 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not dish right here in the middle of Crankville.
L481942 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ You go, boy.
L481941 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I've got a hot one.
L482588 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?
L482587 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ Nervous?
L482447 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ Didn't you hear?  Domingo's dead.
L482446 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.
L482388 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.
L482387 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ When is the deal going down?
L482382 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ Worse. Much worse.  A teacher.
L482381 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys?
L482376 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ You mean the menacing red car?
L482375 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?
L482372 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ What if he caps me before you can make a move?
L482371 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
L482370 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Funny, I don't feel lucky.
L482369 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ You're lucky, Flynne.
L482363 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ They have. But they never found a lab.
L482362 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
L482361 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ Several possession charges, but nothing major.
L482360 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Excuse me?
L482292 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ No.  You've got me all wrong.  I mean, in you own pussified way, you actually got some nuts in your little sack.
L482291 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.
L482290 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ Who'd have thought it?  Danny "Chickenshit" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses.
L482289 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
L482288 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ What'd you do, piss your pants?
L482287 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ That would be me.
L482286 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ What's that smell?
L482271 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
L482270 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
L482269 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
L482268 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ What's on the other end of this thing?
L482262 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
L482261 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ He's the only one I told.
L482260 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ Who the hell is Jimmy?
L482259 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Jimmy?
L482257 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I still don't know what you're talking about.
L482256 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ We know what's going on.
L482032 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
L482031 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me.
L482025 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ And he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a Colombian necktie on whoever it was.
L482024 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ What?!
L482023 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ He knows somebody ratted him.
L482022 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ And what does this have to do with me?
L482021 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ The Mexicali Boys
L482020 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ To who?
L482019 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ Turns out he's connected.
L482018 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Yeah.  What about him?
L482017 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ Danny, it's really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back?
L481970 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
L481969 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne.
L481968 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
L481967 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
L481957 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ What's he holding?
L481956 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
L481955 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
L481954 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though.
L481953 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ It speaks!
L481952 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ This the guy?
L482316 +++$+++ u7415 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Why are you doing this?
L482315 +++$+++ u7411 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY/TOM +++$+++ My sentiments exactly.
L482314 +++$+++ u7415 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ That is so unfair.
L482313 +++$+++ u7411 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY/TOM +++$+++ But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.
L482312 +++$+++ u7415 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Here it comes, poor Tom.
L482311 +++$+++ u7411 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY/TOM +++$+++ No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
L482310 +++$+++ u7415 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
L482309 +++$+++ u7411 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY/TOM +++$+++ We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?
L482308 +++$+++ u7415 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Just admit you're wrong.
L482307 +++$+++ u7411 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY/TOM +++$+++ Just no pleasing you, is there?
L482306 +++$+++ u7415 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
L482305 +++$+++ u7411 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY/TOM +++$+++ First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it?
L482304 +++$+++ u7415 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Look at that place. It's creepy.
L482303 +++$+++ u7411 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY/TOM +++$+++ What do you mean?
L482302 +++$+++ u7415 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ You think that's a good idea?
L482301 +++$+++ u7411 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY/TOM +++$+++ Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
L482300 +++$+++ u7415 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Tom, quit fucking around.
L482299 +++$+++ u7411 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY/TOM +++$+++ Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
L482298 +++$+++ u7415 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ You mean like the Donner Party?
L482297 +++$+++ u7411 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY/TOM +++$+++ Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
L482296 +++$+++ u7415 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
L481996 +++$+++ u7415 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ No.  Right here on the beach.  Come on. Let's do it.
L481995 +++$+++ u7411 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY/TOM +++$+++ There's no motels around here.
L481994 +++$+++ u7415 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Tom, let's spend the night here.
L481991 +++$+++ u7415 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
L481990 +++$+++ u7411 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY/TOM +++$+++ Really?
L481989 +++$+++ u7415 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ And you've got wiener breath.
L481988 +++$+++ u7411 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY/TOM +++$+++ You, madam, are a heartless wench.
L481987 +++$+++ u7415 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ I was talking about Miles.
L481986 +++$+++ u7411 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY/TOM +++$+++ Again, I thank you.
L481985 +++$+++ u7415 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
L481984 +++$+++ u7411 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY/TOM +++$+++ Thank you.  Thank you very much.
L481983 +++$+++ u7415 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.
L482648 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ Maybe he isn't showing.
L482647 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Where's Bubba?
L482590 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
L482589 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
L482441 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.
L482440 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ We're in business.
L482385 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Now that's scary!
L482384 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ She's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.
L482374 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ Don't we always take good care of you?
L482373 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Golly, I hadn't thought of that.
L482285 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ That's not good in prison. It's just not good.
L482284 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.
L482243 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
L482242 +++$+++ u7412 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ GARCETTI +++$+++ You thinking what I'm thinking?
L482185 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I thought you were done.
L482184 +++$+++ u7414 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ KUJO +++$+++ Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.
L482180 +++$+++ u7414 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ KUJO +++$+++ No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.
L482179 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
L482178 +++$+++ u7414 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ KUJO +++$+++ Don't worry about it.
L482177 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ What is that? Rum and coke?
L482165 +++$+++ u7414 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ KUJO +++$+++ Better than drugs.
L482164 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ What is it, drugs?
L482163 +++$+++ u7414 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ KUJO +++$+++ Danny, listen up.  Here's the deal ... my wife's pimp knows a guy who works at Cedars Sinai medical lab.  They're getting a very special delivery a week from this Friday.
L482833 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Thank you, sir.
L482832 +++$+++ u7421 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ COLONEL ANDERSON +++$+++ Good luck, John.
L482828 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away.  One private is simply not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson This one is.  He's worth a lot more than that.  Which is why I'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is.
L482827 +++$+++ u7421 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ COLONEL ANDERSON +++$+++ Alright, I'll give you that. Continue.
L482824 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Respectfully, sir, sending men all the way up to Ramelle to save one private doesn't make a fucking, goddamned bit of sense.  Sir.
L482823 +++$+++ u7421 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ COLONEL ANDERSON +++$+++ Spit it out, Captain.
L482822 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ But, sir...I...I...
L482821 +++$+++ u7421 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ COLONEL ANDERSON +++$+++ He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
L482820 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ A private, sir?
L482819 +++$+++ u7421 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ COLONEL ANDERSON +++$+++ There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.
L482818 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Sir?
