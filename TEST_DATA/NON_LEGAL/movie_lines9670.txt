L126838 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
L126837 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.
L126836 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
L126835 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
L126834 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?
L126591 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
L126590 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Are you sure there's no mistake?
L126589 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
L126588 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
L126587 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
L126586 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Yes -- ?
L126285 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Agents.
L126284 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
L126283 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Me? Why me?
L126282 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
L126281 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Oh. Then who's this one?
L126280 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
L126279 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ But no one actually saw him die.
L126278 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ No, Mrs. Lampert.
L126277 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
L126276 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
L126275 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
L126274 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ That's the spirit.
L126273 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
L126272 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
L126271 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
L126270 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
L126269 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
L126268 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
L126267 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
L126266 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
L126263 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Scobie was able to travel, but Carson Dyle was clearly dying, so they --
L126262 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
L126261 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
L126256 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ May I have a cigarette, please?
L126255 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
L126254 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Steal it how?
L126253 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
L126252 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --
L126250 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Can I at least keep the onion soup?
L126249 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
L126248 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
L126247 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Café.
L126244 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ In 1944, five members of the O.S.S. -- the military espionage unit -- were ordered behind the German lines for the purpose of delivering $250,000 in gold to the French Underground. The five men --
L126243 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Barely, yes.
L126242 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
L126241 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Dead? Mr. Bartholomew -- maybe you'd better tell me what this thing's all about.
L126240 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
L126239 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
L126236 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ You mean you've known about him all along? Why didn't you tell me?
L126235 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
L126234 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Carson?
L126233 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ That's not Carson Dyle.
L126232 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ No, what?
L126231 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ No.
L126230 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
L126229 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Describe him.
L126228 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
L126227 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
L126226 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Dyle, or whatever his name is.
L126225 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Who?
L126224 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
L126223 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Agents.
L126222 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
L126221 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Were you followed?
L126220 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew?
L126206 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Yes, where?  -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there.
L126205 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
L126204 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
L126203 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband.
L126014 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.
L126013 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Oh.
L126012 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Because they're still here.
L126011 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Why not?
L126010 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!
L126009 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
L126008 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
L126007 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
L126006 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- look just as hard and as fast as you can. You may not have a great deal of time. Those men know you have it just as surely as we do. You won't be safe until the money's in our hands. Is that clear?
L126005 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ But --
L126004 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
L126003 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
L126002 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
L126001 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
L126000 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
L125999 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Thanks very much.
L125998 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ I believe you.
L125997 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the truth.
L125996 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
L125995 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ But I don't have it.
L125994 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ And I'm afraid we want it back.
L125993 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Oh, I see.
L125992 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Ours.
L125991 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Then whose is it? His or theirs?
L125990 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.
L125989 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
L125988 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
L125987 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
L125986 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
L125985 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
L125984 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
L125983 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
L125982 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
L125966 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Yes -- and tell me if you recognize anyone. Just a moment. Have a good look.
L125965 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
L125964 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
L125963 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Very sweet.
L125962 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss --  -- I'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you?  Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.
L125961 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ His -- real -- ?
L125960 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name.
L125959 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ So that was it.
L125958 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency.
L125957 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ May I have a sandwich, please?
L125956 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
L125955 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
L125954 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
L125953 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Agent.
L125952 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
L125951 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
L125950 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
L125949 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ We? You mean you're --?
L125948 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Only we call them agents.
L125947 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ You mean spies and things like that?
L125946 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
L125945 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
L125944 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?
L125943 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ No thanks.
L125942 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Have some, please. I've got...  ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.
L125940 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Charles Lampert's widow -- yes?  Last time I sent out a tie only the spot came back.
L125939 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
L125938 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Dry-cleaningwise, things are all fouled up. I had a good man -- an excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here in the building -- to ease the gold outflow.
L125936 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite late.
L125935 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
L125934 +++$+++ u4412 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW +++$+++ I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
L125981 +++$+++ u4422 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE'S VOICE +++$+++ No, thank heaven.
L125980 +++$+++ u4413 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE +++$+++ Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
L125979 +++$+++ u4422 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE'S VOICE +++$+++ That's a face you don't forget -- he was there too --
L125978 +++$+++ u4413 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE +++$+++ The last one, please.
L125977 +++$+++ u4422 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE'S VOICE +++$+++ No.
L125976 +++$+++ u4413 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE +++$+++ Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
L125975 +++$+++ u4422 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE'S VOICE +++$+++ Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one.
L125974 +++$+++ u4413 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE +++$+++ Next, please.
L125973 +++$+++ u4422 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE'S VOICE +++$+++ No.
L125972 +++$+++ u4413 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE +++$+++ Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
L125971 +++$+++ u4422 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE'S VOICE +++$+++ It's the man who came to the funeral yesterday -- I'm sure of it -- a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie.
L125970 +++$+++ u4413 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE +++$+++ 1944. The next face, please.
L125969 +++$+++ u4422 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE'S VOICE +++$+++ He looks so young -- when was this taken?
L125968 +++$+++ u4413 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE +++$+++ Very good.
L125967 +++$+++ u4422 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE'S VOICE +++$+++ It's Charles!
L126978 +++$+++ u4414 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ CRUIKSHANK +++$+++ Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps?
L126977 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
L126976 +++$+++ u4414 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ CRUIKSHANK +++$+++ I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
L126975 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to --  marriage license! Did you say -- ?
L126974 +++$+++ u4414 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ CRUIKSHANK +++$+++ Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
L126973 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ You'd lie about anything.
L126972 +++$+++ u4414 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ CRUIKSHANK +++$+++ I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
L126971 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
L126970 +++$+++ u4414 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ CRUIKSHANK +++$+++ How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
L126969 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
L126968 +++$+++ u4414 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ CRUIKSHANK +++$+++ My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
L126967 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Oh.
L126966 +++$+++ u4414 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ CRUIKSHANK +++$+++ No.
L126965 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ But you're -- divorced?
L126964 +++$+++ u4414 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ CRUIKSHANK +++$+++ Yes.
L126963 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
L126962 +++$+++ u4414 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ CRUIKSHANK +++$+++ Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
L126961 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
L126960 +++$+++ u4414 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ CRUIKSHANK +++$+++ Brian.
L126959 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ What's your first name today?
L126958 +++$+++ u4414 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ CRUIKSHANK +++$+++ Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
L126957 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Starting with his own.
L126956 +++$+++ u4414 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ CRUIKSHANK +++$+++ -- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
L126955 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Bartholomew?
L126954 +++$+++ u4414 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ CRUIKSHANK +++$+++ Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
L126953 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Then how do I know this is your office?
L126952 +++$+++ u4414 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ CRUIKSHANK +++$+++ The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.
L126951 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Around one.
L126950 +++$+++ u4414 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ CRUIKSHANK +++$+++ When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
L126949 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?
L126948 +++$+++ u4414 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ CRUIKSHANK +++$+++ We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
L126947 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
L126946 +++$+++ u4414 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ CRUIKSHANK +++$+++ Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
L126945 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --
L126452 +++$+++ u4423 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SCOBIE +++$+++ I'll take that.
L126451 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.
L126450 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ What's wrong, Herman -- have you got something to hide?  Then I take it there are no objections.
L126449 +++$+++ u4423 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SCOBIE +++$+++ Not my room!
L126446 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ It's all right with us --
L126445 +++$+++ u4423 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SCOBIE +++$+++ He's just tryin' to throw us off! They've got it, I tell you! Why don't we search their rooms?
L126442 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
L126441 +++$+++ u4423 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SCOBIE +++$+++ That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
L126438 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Or you --  Or you --
L126437 +++$+++ u4423 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SCOBIE +++$+++ Me?
L126436 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.
L126435 +++$+++ u4423 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SCOBIE +++$+++ Then who does?
L126434 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ And stop threatening that boy. He doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert doesn't either.
L126336 +++$+++ u4423 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SCOBIE +++$+++ That's the idea.
L126335 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Back where?
L126333 +++$+++ u4423 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SCOBIE +++$+++ You're out, Dyle -- right now!
L126332 +++$+++ u4415 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ DYLE +++$+++ Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
