L118979 +++$+++ u663 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ FERRARI +++$+++ Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.
L118978 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ And the carrying charges?
L118977 +++$+++ u663 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ FERRARI +++$+++ I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
L118976 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
L118975 +++$+++ u663 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ FERRARI +++$+++ If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
L118974 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Practically no one.
L118973 +++$+++ u663 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ FERRARI +++$+++ Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.
L118972 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
L118971 +++$+++ u663 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ FERRARI +++$+++ The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much.
L118970 +++$+++ u663 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ FERRARI +++$+++ Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit down. There's something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.
L118969 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
L118968 +++$+++ u663 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ FERRARI +++$+++ No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
L118967 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
L118473 +++$+++ u663 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ FERRARI +++$+++ My dear Rick, when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy?
L118472 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Suppose we do.
L118471 +++$+++ u663 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ FERRARI +++$+++ Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
L118470 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
L118469 +++$+++ u663 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ FERRARI +++$+++ That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
L118468 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I don't buy or sell human beings.
L118467 +++$+++ u663 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ FERRARI +++$+++ What do you want for Sam?
L118466 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ It's not for sale at any price.
L118465 +++$+++ u663 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ FERRARI +++$+++ You haven't heard my offer.
L118464 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ It's not for sale.
L118463 +++$+++ u663 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ FERRARI +++$+++ Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
L118462 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
L118461 +++$+++ u663 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ FERRARI +++$+++ Hello, Rick.
L119043 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Good day.
L119042 +++$+++ u663 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ FERRARI +++$+++ It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.
L119040 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Thank you very much. Good day.
L119039 +++$+++ u663 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ FERRARI +++$+++ He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
L119038 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Rick?
L119037 +++$+++ u663 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ FERRARI +++$+++ Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
L119036 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Do you know where they are?
L119035 +++$+++ u663 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ FERRARI +++$+++ Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.
L119034 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Yes, something.
L119033 +++$+++ u663 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ FERRARI +++$+++ I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?
L119031 +++$+++ u663 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ FERRARI +++$+++ Well, good luck. But be careful.  You know you're being shadowed?
L119030 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much.
L119018 +++$+++ u663 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ FERRARI +++$+++ -- We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles.
L119017 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while --
L119014 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you.
L119013 +++$+++ u663 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ FERRARI +++$+++ As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
L119012 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
L119229 +++$+++ u669 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ STRASSER +++$+++ My dear Mademoiselle, perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca, human life is cheap. Good night, Mademoiselle.
L119228 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ And the other alternative?
L119227 +++$+++ u669 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ STRASSER +++$+++ It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
L119226 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ What are they?
L119225 +++$+++ u669 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ STRASSER +++$+++ There are only two other alternatives for him.
L119224 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
L119223 +++$+++ u669 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ STRASSER +++$+++ Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
L119222 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Occupied France?
L119221 +++$+++ u669 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ STRASSER +++$+++ That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
L119220 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
L119219 +++$+++ u669 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ STRASSER +++$+++ Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
L118929 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ You needn't be concerned about me.
L118928 +++$+++ u669 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ STRASSER +++$+++ And Mademoiselle?
L119471 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
L119470 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Yes.
L119462 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now, now...
L119461 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ And I said I would never leave you.
L119460 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
L119459 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ But what about us?
L119458 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
L119457 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ No.
L119456 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
L119453 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ -- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?
L119452 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ But Richard, no, I, I --
L119451 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ -- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
L119450 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
L119449 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
L119448 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ I don't understand. What about you?
L119447 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Because you're getting on that plane.
L119446 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ But why my name, Richard?
L119406 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Oh, Rick!
L119405 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Everything is quite all right.
L119404 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
L119403 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ No, not yet.
L119402 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?
L119313 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ I wish I didn't love you so much.
L119312 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
L119311 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
L119310 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ All except one. He won't have you.
L119309 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
L119308 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ And Laszlo?
L119307 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
L119306 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
L119305 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
L119304 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ When did you first find out he was alive?
L119303 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
L119302 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Why weren't you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret?
L119301 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.
L119300 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ And then?
L119296 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.
L119295 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ For the last time, put them on the table.
L119294 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ No.
L119293 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Put them on the table.
L119292 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I don't have to. I've got them right here.
L119291 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ -- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.
L119289 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
L119288 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
L119286 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ -- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want.
L119285 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
L119284 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ -- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
L119283 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
L119282 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I'm not fighting for anything anymore, except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in.
L119281 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
L119280 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
L119279 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
L119278 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
L119277 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
L119276 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
L119275 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Please.
L119274 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
L119273 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Richard, I had to see you.
L119272 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
L119271 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ The stairs from the street.
L119270 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ How did you get in?
L119009 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
L119008 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
L119007 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Well, I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now, above a saloon, it's true, but... walk up a flight. I'll be expecting you.
L119006 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ You can believe that if you want to.
L119005 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
L119004 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
L119003 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
L119002 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ I don't think I will, Rick.
L119001 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
L119000 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Yes.
L118999 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?
L118993 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ It doesn't matter.
L118992 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.
L118909 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, "Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid," it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?
L118908 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
L118907 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
L118906 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ I don't know the finish yet.
L118905 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Has it got a wow finish?
L118904 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Can I tell you a story, Rick?
L118903 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
L118902 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ I didn't count the days.
L118901 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
L118900 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
L118899 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
L118898 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
L118897 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
L118896 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Please.
L118895 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Especially tonight.
L118894 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
L118893 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
L118887 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
L118886 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
L118885 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Oh, darling!
L118884 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
L118883 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ That's too far ahead to plan.
L118882 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
L118881 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
L118880 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ -- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
L118879 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Yes, of course, we --
L118878 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ No, no, no, no. We must leave.
L118877 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
L118876 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
L118875 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Strange. I know so very little about you.
L118871 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
L118870 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
L118869 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Looking for a job.
L118868 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
L118867 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
L118866 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
L118865 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
L118864 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ My German's a little rusty.
L118860 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.
L118859 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.
L118857 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions.
L118856 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
L118855 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ That's easy. There was. He's dead.
L118854 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Uh huh.
L118853 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Why there is no other man in my life?
L118852 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
L118851 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Yes?
L118850 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ And I was wondering.
L118849 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
L118848 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
L118847 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ A franc for your thoughts.
L118846 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Here's looking at you, kid.
L118845 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ We said "no questions."
L118844 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?
L118799 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ He hasn't played it in a long time.
L118798 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
L118797 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I will.
L118796 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Say goodnight to Sam for me.
L118785 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
L118784 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
L118783 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ No.
L118782 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Not an easy day to forget.
L118781 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
L118780 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ -- It was "La Belle Aurore."
L118752 +++$+++ u668 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
L118751 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
L118750 +++$+++ u668 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
L118749 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
L118748 +++$+++ u668 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
L118747 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
