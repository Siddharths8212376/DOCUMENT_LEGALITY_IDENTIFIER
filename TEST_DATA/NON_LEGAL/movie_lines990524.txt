L663192 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ We can’t.
L663191 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ We’ve got to get out.
L663180 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Count to twenty.  I’ll be there.
L663179 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ But what if...
L663178 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or we’ll sink.
L663171 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Just wanted to put him on edge...
L663170 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ What kind of bikes did you ride?
L663169 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Like riding a bike.
L663168 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ Do you know what you’re doing?
L663167 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ He’s going to insert the plutonium.
L663166 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ He’s sealed himself in.
L663156 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ We go down to the torpedo bay.
L663155 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ Is there another way?
L663103 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ If I don’t get to the Boa before he gets to Maiden’s Tower, M is dead.
L663102 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ Zukovsky...
L663073 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Elektra would control it all.
L663072 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ The King pipeline.
L663071 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
L663070 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
L663067 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Made to look just like an accident.
L663066 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  He’s not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub’s reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
L663065 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Nuclear.
L662988 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And M’s life is part of the bet.
L662987 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ What is it?
L662979 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I was hoping you could tell me.
L662978 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
L662977 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Makes her look even more innocent.
L662976 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
L662975 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Elektra King.
L662974 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ Who’s she?
L662973 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ It’s part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
L662972 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ What the hell are you talking about?
L662971 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I did kill us. She thinks we’re dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
L662970 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
L662953 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ It’s a bomb alright. We’re still dead if the trigger charge goes off...
L662952 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Then it’s no longer a bomb?
L662951 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ The plutonium is missing.  They’ve taken the core!
L662945 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Alright then, brunch.
L662944 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
L662943 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
L662880 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ With this?
L662879 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ They won’t get far. Every warhead has a locator card.  A Miratom device.  Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb.
L662877 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Bond --
L662876 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ So who are you?
L662875 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Shame you had to spot I wasn’t the real thing.
L662865 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Here’s your imposter. He’s paid off the men on the plane outside.  They’re not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, they’re flying it wherever he tells them.
L662864 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ He is an impostor.  There’s no Davidov at Miratom.
L662836 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ The soldiers may give you a hard time. Whatever. If we weren’t around, they’d have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun.
L662835 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Couldn’t make it. Splitting headache.
L662834 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ What happened to Len Tashka?
L662833 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Don’t know any doctor jokes.
L662832 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, I’ve heard them all.
L662831 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
L662830 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ You new?
L662605 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I could come for a second opinion?
L662604 +++$+++ u8967 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ DOCTOR GREATREX +++$+++ ...yes?...
L662603 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Perhaps after this ... test?
L662602 +++$+++ u8967 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ DOCTOR GREATREX +++$+++ Then maybe I’d be... open to that.
L662598 +++$+++ u8967 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ DOCTOR GREATREX +++$+++ James.  It wouldn’t really be...
L662597 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ It’s just a scratch.
L662596 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
L662595 +++$+++ u8967 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ DOCTOR GREATREX +++$+++ Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It won’t just be two weeks out of action.
L662921 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Is maybe...the inside woman.
L662920 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ The inside man?
L662919 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ They’re getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I can’t help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
L662918 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
L662917 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ The report King bought. It’s a manual. Renard’s men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
L662651 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ The worm on the hook again.
L662650 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasn’t completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
L662647 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ He’s not through yet. Renard doesn’t blow up five million dollars unless he knows there’s more coming in. He’s working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
L662646 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
L662645 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ ‘That which does not kill me makes me stronger.’
L662644 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
L662643 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ The doctor who saved him couldn’t get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, he’s a dead man.
L662642 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ He survived?
L662640 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, I’d do the same again.
L662639 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
L662638 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektra’s ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
L662637 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Renard.
L662636 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
L662635 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Who?
L662634 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ It’s a message.  He wants us to know he’s back.
L662632 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.
L662631 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ I’m well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
L662630 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I was the one who brought that money in...
L662629 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ You haven’t been given an assignment in this case.
L662628 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I took the initiative.
L662627 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Who told you to look at Elektra’s files?
L662613 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ And now it’s up for grabs, a goldrush. Far more oil than anyone thought.
L662612 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle.  Largest landlocked body of water on Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.
L662611 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ 007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
L662593 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
L662592 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ It’s barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
L662591 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ I’ve scheduled a medical for you.
L662590 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ She’s not a girl anymore.
L662589 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Elektra?  Running King Industries?  I’ve known that girl all her life. I’m not sure she knows what she’s walking into.
L662566 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Who buys classified reports for three million pounds.
L662565 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. He’s a man of great integrity.
L662564 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Old friend?
L662563 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Quite the opposite, in fact.
L662562 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Construction’s not exactly my line.
L662549 +++$+++ u8969 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ LACHAISE +++$+++ I can’t tell you...  Alright, alright! But you must protect me!
L662548 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ The name?
L662546 +++$+++ u8969 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ LACHAISE +++$+++ Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?
L662545 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Your last chance. Give me the name.
L662544 +++$+++ u8969 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ LACHAISE +++$+++ Your last chance. Take the money.
L662543 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
L662542 +++$+++ u8969 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ LACHAISE +++$+++ I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
L662541 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Who did you get it from?
L662540 +++$+++ u8969 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ LACHAISE +++$+++ I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
L662532 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Which is neutral, no doubt.
L662531 +++$+++ u8969 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ LACHAISE +++$+++ Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position..
L663163 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Haven’t you heard the news?  So is she.
L663162 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ In case you’ve forgotten.  I’m dead already.
L662859 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldn’t have done it without you.
L662858 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ She’ll get over it.
L662857 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ It’s I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
L662856 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Consider me ungrateful.
L662855 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
L662854 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
L662853 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  She’s beautiful isn’t she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
L662852 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Who is it?
L662851 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
L662850 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Revenge isn’t so hard to fathom. What’s clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
L662844 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Indeed.
L662843 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.
L662586 +++$+++ u8973 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ He died before he could complete his lifelong dream.  I intend to finish it for him.
L662585 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I’m sorry.
L662584 +++$+++ u8973 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ He was my father.
L662583 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ You knew him well?
L662582 +++$+++ u8973 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ A word? I’m sure by now he’s engineered a hostile takeover.
L662581 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
L662580 +++$+++ u8973 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
L662579 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Yes.
L662578 +++$+++ u8973 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Beautiful, isn’t it?
L663134 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Oh James.
L663133 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ One... last... screw?
L663130 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Elektra, it’s not too late.  Eight million people needn’t die.
L663129 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Know what happens when a man is strangled?
L663126 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
L663125 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. I’m going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfather’s name, the glory of my people.
L663124 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ It is my oil!  Mine and my family’s!
L663123 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Was this all about the oil?
L663122 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
L663121 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ So you killed your father.
L663119 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Just like you...only you were even easier.
L663118 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ You turned Renard.
L663117 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Since I was a child, I’ve always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldn’t rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
L663116 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Five more turns and your neck will break.
L663115 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ All this, because you fell for Renard?
L663114 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Soon she’ll be everywhere.
L663113 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Where’s M?
L663111 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Not interested.
L663110 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ I could have given you the world.
L662912 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ You do what you have to do, but I’ve called in M.  She’s en route from London even now.
L662911 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I’m coming with you.
L662909 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ You knew.  You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you used me as bait. You made love to me -- what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike?
L662908 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ He used your exact words.
L662907 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didn’t have to sleep with you to find that out.
L662905 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I think you do.
L662904 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ I don’t know what you’re talking about!
L662903 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ You can drop the act, it’s over.
L662902 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Are you saying...Renard is the man who’s trying to kill me?
L662901 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
L662900 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ ...what?
L662899 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
L662898 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L662897 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ A little. Does it matter? After all, what’s the point of living if you can’t feel alive?  Isn’t that right, Elektra? Isn’t that your motto?
L662896 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ What’s wrong with you?  Are you crazy?
L662816 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  I’ve never told anyone that.
L662815 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ How did you survive?
L662809 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Shush.
L662808 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this.
L662799 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Not at that price. Time to surrender.
L662798 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Surely you believe in living dangerously.
