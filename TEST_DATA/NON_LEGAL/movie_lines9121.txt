L270387 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Haven't we met before?
L270386 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Hello.
L270385 +++$+++ u1269 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ Okay, lady. Out.
L270375 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ All right, then, and we'll be off.  Nice chatting with you.
L270374 +++$+++ u1269 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ Lady, let me get this straight.
L270373 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
L270372 +++$+++ u1269 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ Your tree.
L270371 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
L270370 +++$+++ u1269 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ Took it?
L270369 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ No, no. I just took it.
L270368 +++$+++ u1269 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ Isn't this your vehicle?
L270367 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
L270366 +++$+++ u1269 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ Could I see your registration?
L270365 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
L270364 +++$+++ u1269 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ How long have you been driving?
L270363 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
L270362 +++$+++ u1269 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ Come again.
L270361 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Oh, I don't have one.
L270360 +++$+++ u1269 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ Yes.
L270359 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
L270358 +++$+++ u1269 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?
L270473 +++$+++ u1270 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ EDITH +++$+++ Well, not all the southwest. Although we do have a large business... Barley was very big last week...  Fifteen hundred...
L270472 +++$+++ u1274 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MRS. CHASEN +++$+++ She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
L270471 +++$+++ u1270 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ EDITH +++$+++ Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...
L270470 +++$+++ u1274 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MRS. CHASEN +++$+++ Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
L270469 +++$+++ u1270 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ EDITH +++$+++ I'm a file clerk.
L270468 +++$+++ u1274 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MRS. CHASEN +++$+++ Edith was just telling me about her job.
L270465 +++$+++ u1270 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ EDITH +++$+++ I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Southern California. So you can imagine.
L270464 +++$+++ u1274 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MRS. CHASEN +++$+++ Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
L270463 +++$+++ u1270 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ EDITH +++$+++ Not very.
L270462 +++$+++ u1274 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MRS. CHASEN +++$+++ How interesting.
L270461 +++$+++ u1270 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ EDITH +++$+++ I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
L270460 +++$+++ u1274 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MRS. CHASEN +++$+++ And what do you do, my dear?
L270458 +++$+++ u1270 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ EDITH +++$+++ Fern. I'm very pleased to make your acquaintance.
L270457 +++$+++ u1274 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MRS. CHASEN +++$+++ Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
L270456 +++$+++ u1270 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ EDITH +++$+++ Oh. It looks like a hearse.  Very nice. Compact.
L270454 +++$+++ u1270 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ EDITH +++$+++ What kind of a car is it?
L270453 +++$+++ u1274 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MRS. CHASEN +++$+++ This way, Edith. Harold is out by the garage. He has a new car and he has been tuning it up. He's very mechanical.
L270419 +++$+++ u1271 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ GLAUCUS +++$+++ What?... Oh yes... Shovel... Create ... Verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods... Iliad... Just sit down for a minute.
L270418 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Here's your shovel.
L270352 +++$+++ u1271 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ GLAUCUS +++$+++ I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
L270351 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What do you see?
L270350 +++$+++ u1271 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ GLAUCUS +++$+++ Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
L270349 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ A block of ice.
L270348 +++$+++ u1271 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ GLAUCUS +++$+++ A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one.  Tell me, what do you see?
L270347 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Sorry I'm late.
L270224 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.
L270223 +++$+++ u1271 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ GLAUCUS +++$+++ What do you want?
L270750 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
L270749 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Please, don't you realize? She is dying.
L270738 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
L270737 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
L270728 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Oh! That's wonderful, Harold. Go - and love some more.
L270727 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
L270726 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ "And this too shall pass away."
L270725 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It's true. I can't live without you.
L270724 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
L270723 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
L270722 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ I feel giddy.
L270721 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ I thought eighty was a good round number.
L270720 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ But why now?
L270719 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
L270718 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
L270717 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
L270716 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight.
L270715 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ But you're not going anywhere, are you?
L270714 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
L270713 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Farewell?
L270712 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
L270711 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ ... which I hope will make you very happy.
L270709 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ For you.
L270708 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Oh, Harold. 
L270707 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It's all right. It's organic.
L270706 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
L270705 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Supper for two.
L270668 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Oh, Harold. You are so young.
L270667 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
L270666 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
L270663 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You haven't changed a bit. I'll put it in my wallet.
L270662 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
L270661 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It looks like you. Thanks.
L270656 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'll never forget you, Maude.  But I would like a photo of you.
L270655 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
L270654 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Why?
L270653 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ I took them out.
L270652 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Why are there no photographs in these frames?
L270645 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Here.
L270644 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Yes.
L270643 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Maude.
L270642 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ - end where I began.
L270641 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Oh, no. But I should have liked to have been an astronaut. A private astronaut able to just go out and explore. Like the men who sailed with Magellan, I want to see if we really can fall off the edge of the world.  What a joke it will be if like them I -
L270640 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You should have been a poet.
L270639 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
L270638 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
L270637 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ I don't know. Perhaps.
L270636 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Do you think there is any life up there?
L270635 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Yes. They're old friends.
L270634 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Look at the stars.
L270633 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Well, they're my species.
L270632 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You sure have a way with people.
L270631 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
L270630 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ How about some candy floss?
L270629 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Come on, you loved it. It was a new experience.
L270628 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
L270627 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Oh, you weren't scared.
L270626 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
L270625 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ That wasn't very scary.
L270618 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ She took my head.
L270617 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Give me that.  I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
L270616 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Just like this.
L270613 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ ... of you. You'll all end up like this.
L270612 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Don't you advance on me.
L270609 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
L270608 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least...
L270554 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ What? With your skill and my experience... I think we can come up with something.
L270553 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Maude, do you think you can help me?
L270552 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
L270551 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Really. Just put it there, Harold.
L270550 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ But they'll put me in jail.
L270548 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Well, don't go.
L270547 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ But they have.
L270546 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
L270545 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
L270544 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ What is it, Harold?
L270543 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Maude, I must speak to you.
L270500 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Well, be kind. I've lived a long time, Harold, seen evil as well as good, and it has been my experience that kindness...
L270499 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I've never met her. My mother set it up.
L270498 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Oh.
L270497 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
L270496 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.
L270495 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.
L270494 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ From the guys who got the matches, of course. 
L270493 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Where's that?
L270492 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."
L270491 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Yodeling?
L270490 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ No. I feel more like - yodeling.
L270489 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Want to join me in some cartwheels?
L270488 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.
L270487 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ No. I'd feel stupid.
L270486 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Well, why don't you?
L270485 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults .
L270484 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ With Life.
L270483 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ With God?
L270482 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Pray? No.  I communicate. 
L270481 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Maude, do you pray?
L270480 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
L270479 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
L270478 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ It's so blue.
L270477 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Look at that sky.  It's so big.
L270452 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ I like you, Harold.  Come, I'll teach you to waltz.
L270451 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I like you, Maude.
L270450 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
L270447 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Okay.
L270446 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Of course.
L270445 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?
L270444 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ How ingenious! Tell me about them.
L270443 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
L270442 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ What was that?
L270441 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
L270440 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
L270439 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You are the wisest person I know.
L270438 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
L270437 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Did Confucius say that?
L270436 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
L270435 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'm sure picking up on vices.
L270434 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ It's all right.  It's organic.
L270433 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Well, I really don't smoke.
L270432 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
L270431 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I like Glaucus.
L270430 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
L270429 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
L270428 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Yes.
L270427 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The ice is melting.
L270422 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Yes. It's almost there.
L270421 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I <u>think</u> I see it.
L270416 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
L270415 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
L270382 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ I suppose I did.  Well, farewell little tree. Grow up tall, and change, and fall to replenish the earth. Isn't it wonderful, Harold? All around us. Living things.
L270381 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I don't know.
L270380 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?
L270379 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
L270378 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ He's stopped.
L270377 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.
L270376 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I think he's following us.
L270338 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Superb.
L270337 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Okay?
L270334 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Don't play anything! Dear me. Everyone should be able to make some music. Why, it's life! - Rhythm and harmony - That's the cosmic dance. Come with me.
L270333 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ But I don't play anything.
L270332 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.
L270330 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Oh come on. I'll teach you.
L270329 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Well, I don't...
L270328 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
L270327 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ No more revolts.
L270326 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ No.
L270323 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.  Later, Frederick would chide me about it.  He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.
L270322 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What were you fighting for?
L270321 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
L270320 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What's that?
L270319 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Thank you.
L270318 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
