L115298 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
L115297 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
L115296 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ We'll cover it later.
L115295 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ What?
L115294 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
L115293 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Oh, him.
L115292 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
L115291 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
L115290 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
L115289 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Why do you keep saying that?
L115288 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
L115287 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ What, um...  What do we do?
L115286 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Our purposes.
L115285 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.
L115252 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ It's true.
L115251 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?
L115249 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Skip it.
L115248 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I have cheerleading squad.
L115247 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Meet me at this address after school.
L115246 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ All right.
L115245 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
L115244 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ She --
L115243 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Where's the other one?
L115240 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ We wait for Robert to wake up.
L115239 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ All right.  What do we do now?
L115238 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
L115237 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Wait a minute.
L115235 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ This is it.
L115234 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ None of your business.  God.
L115233 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Cramps?
L115232 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Ow.
L115231 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Oh, yeah, tell everyone I'm crazy. Beauty ida.
L115230 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
L115229 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I can't believe I'm doing this.  I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.
L115228 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I have to show you.
L115227 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ How do you know all this?
L115226 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Lothos.
L115225 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
L115224 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Oh, my God.  I never told anybody about this.  I remember the one about the peasant, too.  God, there's a bunch.  Is this, like channeling or something.
L115223 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ China.
L115222 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
L115221 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ In Virginia.
L115220 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I was a slave.
L115219 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ In the past.  A girl.  Maybe... A Magyar peasant.  An Indian princess. A slave.
L115218 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Everybody does.
L115217 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
L115216 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Just stay away from me, okay?
L115212 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
L115211 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
L115210 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Yes.
L115209 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
L115208 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
L115207 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Time to do what?
L115206 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
L115205 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
L115204 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
L115203 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
L115202 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Wait!
L115201 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
L115200 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
L115199 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.
L115198 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ My birthright?  You mean, like a trust fund?
L115197 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ To bring you... your birthright.
L115196 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Why?
L115195 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
L115194 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L115193 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
L115192 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Am I in trouble or something?
L115191 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I'm looking for you, actually.
L115190 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?
L115189 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.
L115188 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death.
L115703 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Oh.
L115702 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ I haven't seen him tonight.
L115701 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Have you guys seen Jeffrey?  The limo never showed, I thought he might be here.
L115700 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Hi.
L115699 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Hi, guys.
L115660 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Later for it.
L115659 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Nicole...
L115658 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Well, I guess you got what you came for.
L115639 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ You're having a fling with him?
L115638 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Pike.
L115550 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Sorry.
L115549 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps.
L115265 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ You and Cassandra get anything done last night?
L115264 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Thanks.
L115263 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
L115187 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ B'bye.
L115186 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
L115185 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
L115182 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ I guess.
L115181 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Yeah... She's okay, though.
L115180 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Cassandra's really smart.
L115179 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ You guys blow.  I'm waiting on Cassandra.  She's gonna help me with my history.
L115176 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
L115175 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ I don't get it.
L115172 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Nobody is even gonna look at the game.
L115171 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Thank you very much.
L115170 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ That is so cool.
L115157 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ No.  It was mondo bizarro.
L115156 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I was just scared is all.
L115155 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ -- like she's gonna kill me.
L115142 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ What, it's not weird.  I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
L115141 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Come one, that was so weird.
L115087 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Cassandra, you gotta come, too.
L115086 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.
L114956 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Good enough!
L114955 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ That's the plan.
L114954 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?
L114942 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ They don't even have Dolby.
L114941 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ No THX.
L114930 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador.  Like I'm ever going to Spain anyway.  Ooh!
L114929 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
L114928 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.
L115282 +++$+++ u4302 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Swear to God.
L115281 +++$+++ u4308 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ LOTHOS +++$+++ Really?
L115280 +++$+++ u4302 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.
L115273 +++$+++ u4308 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ LOTHOS +++$+++ Are we so strange?  So alien to you?  I've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste... it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect place to spread my empire.  Honestly, Eastern Europe was so dead, the Communists just drained the blood out of the place.  It's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this.... this Mecca of consumption.  The city of Angels.
L115272 +++$+++ u4302 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ What... are you?
L115271 +++$+++ u4308 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ LOTHOS +++$+++ Yes, I'm sure they do.  This place is everything you said it was, Amilyn.
L115270 +++$+++ u4302 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ My parents have money...
L115269 +++$+++ u4308 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ LOTHOS +++$+++ So very much.
L115268 +++$+++ u4302 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ What's happening?  What do you want?
L115267 +++$+++ u4308 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ LOTHOS +++$+++ I find it restorative, sleeping in the life-blood of so many.  To feel their souls coursing about me.
L114921 +++$+++ u4309 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ You are much more.
L114920 +++$+++ u4303 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ I'm just a girl.
L114919 +++$+++ u4309 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers.  Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called.
L114918 +++$+++ u4309 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Ever since Adam and Eve first left the garden, he followed: the serpent. Satan.  He sends his legion in the shape of men, to feed on us, to breed his Hell on our earth.  They are a plague upon us.
L114917 +++$+++ u4303 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ I don't understand.
L114916 +++$+++ u4309 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ The mark of the Coven.
L114915 +++$+++ u4309 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ She has died.  You are the next to be called.  Why do you think you were sent to me?  Trained as you were?  You bear the mark.
L114914 +++$+++ u4303 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ Why?  Why me?
L114913 +++$+++ u4309 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
L114912 +++$+++ u4303 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ I can't!
L115003 +++$+++ u4304 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ GRUELLER +++$+++ Good.
L115002 +++$+++ u4313 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Got that.
L115001 +++$+++ u4304 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ GRUELLER +++$+++ Listen, you little worm.  I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that?  You got that?
L115000 +++$+++ u4313 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Could be.
L114999 +++$+++ u4304 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ GRUELLER +++$+++ You think so?
L114998 +++$+++ u4313 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Could be.
L114997 +++$+++ u4304 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ GRUELLER +++$+++ What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?
L114996 +++$+++ u4313 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Hi, Grueller.
L114995 +++$+++ u4304 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ GRUELLER +++$+++ Bessel!  What are you doing here?
L115832 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I heard she got straight A's.
L115831 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school.  All year.  She didn't even go to the prom.
L115783 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ But --
L115782 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Okay, let's go.
L115781 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ No --
L115780 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Well, I'm done.  Are you done?
L115779 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Jeffrey!
L115778 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Buffy?
L115776 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Make me a woman!  Yes!  Make me a woman!
L115775 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Oh, baby!
L115774 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Oh, yes!  Yes!
L115066 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Okay, what else?
L115065 +++$+++ u4305 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Write that down.
L115830 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Buffy?
L115829 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.
L115653 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Okay.
L115652 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ And Spring Fling.
L115620 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Throw it out.
L115619 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I got all the plastic stuff.  What should I do with it?
L115426 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Probably was.  What do you suppose she was doing out there.
L115425 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Well, I hope so.
L115424 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  Like dealing.
L115144 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Where'd you learn how to do that?
L115143 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ I can't believe they still ate it.
L115632 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Does Jeffrey know?
L115631 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Cool!
L115566 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ What is she...
L115565 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Buffy!
L115178 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ I gotta bail.  You coming?
L115177 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I never thought of that.
L115154 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --
L115153 +++$+++ u4306 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
L115152 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
