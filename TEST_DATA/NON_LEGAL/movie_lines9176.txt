L327827 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.
L327826 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I'm lost, boss.  What are we saying here?
L327761 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Gee, thanks boss.
L327760 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
L327759 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
L327758 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
L327757 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
L327756 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
L327755 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
L327710 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead serious.  And we're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago.  How did you find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas that day?
L327709 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Lord, wake me, please.  I must be dreaming.
L327697 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
L327696 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
L327678 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Old stains, Bill, but just as telling.
L327677 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
L327676 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?
L327567 +++$+++ u1558 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ The anonymous kind, Chief.
L327566 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Hold your horses.  What kinda source?
L328263 +++$+++ u1559 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ CORONER +++$+++ If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim. 
L328262 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.
L328261 +++$+++ u1559 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ CORONER +++$+++ Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
L328260 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
L328259 +++$+++ u1559 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ CORONER +++$+++ He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
L328258 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
L328246 +++$+++ u1559 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ CORONER +++$+++ I don't see any violence, Jim.  Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm.  Looks like natural causes.
L328245 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What's it look like, Nick?
L328616 +++$+++ u1565 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ GOLDBERG +++$+++ Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...
L328615 +++$+++ u1560 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ DYMOND +++$+++ I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
L328614 +++$+++ u1565 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ GOLDBERG +++$+++ Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
L328613 +++$+++ u1560 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ DYMOND +++$+++ Why?
L328612 +++$+++ u1565 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ GOLDBERG +++$+++ I did.
L328611 +++$+++ u1560 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ DYMOND +++$+++ Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in New York, you had drinks and, under the influence discussed killing Kennedy, is that not so?
L328642 +++$+++ u1560 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ DYMOND +++$+++ Thank you... Mr. Shaw.
L328641 +++$+++ u1585 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ No, I did not.
L328640 +++$+++ u1560 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ DYMOND +++$+++ ...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
L328639 +++$+++ u1585 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.
L328638 +++$+++ u1560 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ DYMOND +++$+++ ...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
L328637 +++$+++ u1585 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ No, I did not.
L328636 +++$+++ u1560 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ DYMOND +++$+++ ...ever called Dean Andrews?
L328635 +++$+++ u1585 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ No, I did not.
L328634 +++$+++ u1560 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ DYMOND +++$+++ ...Oswald?
L328163 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ They're Agency, too.  Don't you get it?  CIA and Mafia together.  Trying to whack out the Beard.  Mutual interests.  They been doing it for years.  There's more to this than you dream.  FBI fucking hates the CIA.  Navy Intelligence got something to do with it too.  Check out "Alan Pope" in Miami.  Jack Youngblood. Bill Harvey.  Colonel Roselli.  The shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop - the bagman at Ruby's club.  I heard he shot his own partner.  Got that? Check out the rich fucks in Dallas. H.L. Hunt.  He's dirty.  That's all I know.  But the Agency always runs the show.  Check out something called "Mongoose"  Operation Mongoose. Government, Pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man - check out Southeast Asia - that's the next big number - the heroin trail.  "Oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive."
L328162 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ What about the mob, Dave?  How do they figure in this?
L328147 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ Photographs - compromising stuff. And he'll use 'em.  The Agency plays for keeps...  I knew Oswald.  He was in my Civil Air Patrol unit.  I taught him everything.  A "wanna be," y'know, nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch.  I treated him good.  He'd talk about his kid, y'know, really wanted her to grow up with a chance, but... He got a raw deal.  The Agency fucked him.  Just like they're gonna fuck me.
L328146 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ What do you mean?
L328145 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls.
L328144 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
L328143 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
L328142 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I"m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready.
L328134 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ I don't know who to trust anymore. Yeah, sure I could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of Camels. You got anything new in the investigation?
L328133 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
L328132 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ I'm caught in the middle.  They're after me.  It's almost over.
L328122 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ I got no place to sleep.  I'll meet you in 20 minutes.
L328121 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
L328120 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ ...give me protection?
L328119 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?
L328118 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
L328117 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
L328116 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ It leads farther than that.
L328115 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
L328114 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ You still questioning any Cubans?
L328113 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ What did they...
L328112 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
L328111 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
L328110 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
L328109 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Calm down, Dave, what?
L328108 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me?
L328107 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Dave, do you think we're out of our minds?  The whole building's been a zoo since that broke.  We can't get a thing done.  Reporters crawling everywhere.  You think we want that?
L328106 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
L328105 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Dave?
L328104 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ You know damn well who it is.
L328170 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ Yeah, yeah.  But leave me alone for awhile.  I got to make some calls.
L328169 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
L328168 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.
L328167 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Dave, it's going to be okay.  Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you.  I guarantee it.
L328166 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ Shit!  Forgot to glue this fuckin' rug today.  You know, at one time I even had a full head of hair like everyone else.  And then I lost that. That fuckin' Clay Shaw.  I hate the bastard.  All I got left is in his rotten, bloody hands.  He tipped the newspapers - I know it.  That's how the Agency works.  They use people, chew them up, spit 'em out.  Now it's my turn.
L328165 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is too fuckin' big for you!  Who did Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't you get it yet?  I can't be talking like this.  They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die!  I don't know what happened.  All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God.  But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  They defrocked me.  And then I started to lose everything.
L328164 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Then who killed the President?
L328161 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ Jack?  Jack was a pimp.  A bagman in Dallas for the Mob.  He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our side.  Check out Jack Youngblood. Shit - we almost had Castro.  Then we tried to whack him.  Everybody's flipping sides all the time.  It's fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games.
L328160 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What about Ruby?
L328159 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.
L328158 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ And Shaw?
L328157 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.
L328156 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?
L328155 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
L328154 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Did you take a good look at the TV when they had Oswald?
L328153 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ Same one.  I didn't know no impersonator.
L328152 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that was in Dallas, or was it an impersonator.
L328149 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ Fuckin' A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
L328148 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Let me get this straight, now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?
L328140 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track.
L328139 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
L328138 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
L328137 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Who was paying you, Dave?
L328136 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
L328135 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
L327922 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Would you say this "Leon" was actually Lee Harvey Oswald?
L327921 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ Leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right.
L327607 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
L327606 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ Why?  What's wrong?
L327605 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
L327604 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
L327603 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
L327602 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
L327601 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ But the boys told us they didn't get any.
L327600 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ I believe the boys got a couple.
L327599 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Did you bag any geese on this trip?
L327598 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
L327597 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ And then Sunday?
L327596 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
L327595 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Why Galveston?
L327594 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
L327593 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I see.  And where did you drive?
L327592 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
L327591 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
L327590 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
L327589 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What was so appealing about Houston?
L327588 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
L327587 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
L327586 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ No, I never saw him before in my life.
L327585 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
L327584 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
L327583 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
L327582 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
L327581 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
L327580 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
L327579 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ How could I forget?  You make quite a first impression.  Sharon, could you please bring us some coffee?  I've heard over the years you're quite a first-rate pilot, Dave. Legend has it you can get in and out of any field, no matter how small...  I'm a bit of a pilot myself, you know.  Flew grasshoppers for the field artillery in the war.
L327578 +++$+++ u1561 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FERRIE +++$+++ Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
L327577 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?
L328676 +++$+++ u1562 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FINCK +++$+++ Oh yes, there were admirals - and when you are a lieutenant colonel in the Army you just follow orders, and at the end of the autopsy we were specifically told - as I recall it was Admiral Kenney, the Surgeon General of the Navy - we were specifically told not to discuss the case.
L328675 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ There were admirals.
L328674 +++$+++ u1562 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FINCK +++$+++ No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
L328673 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
L328672 +++$+++ u1562 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FINCK +++$+++ No.
L328671 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
L328670 +++$+++ u1562 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FINCK +++$+++ I don't remember his name.  You must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are.
L328667 +++$+++ u1562 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FINCK +++$+++ Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that - he said...
L328666 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?
L328665 +++$+++ u1562 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FINCK +++$+++ I had the cause of death.
L328664 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
L328663 +++$+++ u1562 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ FINCK +++$+++ I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
L328662 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?
L328631 +++$+++ u1570 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JUDGE HAGGERTY +++$+++ Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
L328630 +++$+++ u1564 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ GARRISON +++$+++ I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
L328629 +++$+++ u1570 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JUDGE HAGGERTY +++$+++ If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
L328628 +++$+++ u1564 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ GARRISON +++$+++ That's our case!
L328627 +++$+++ u1570 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JUDGE HAGGERTY +++$+++ I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm ruling it inadmissible.
L328626 +++$+++ u1564 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ GARRISON +++$+++ Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias.  You know that.  There's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions.
L328622 +++$+++ u1564 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ GARRISON +++$+++ What?
L328621 +++$+++ u1570 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JUDGE HAGGERTY +++$+++ I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
L328556 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ There's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared, Jasper, Virginia. Telling the truth can be a scary thing.  It scared President Kennedy, but he was a brave man.  If you let yourself be too scared, then you let the bad guys take over the country, don't you - and then everybody gets scared.
L328555 +++$+++ u1566 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JASPER +++$+++ I'm scared.
L328551 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No, Jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.
L328550 +++$+++ u1566 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JASPER +++$+++ Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
L328549 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
L328548 +++$+++ u1566 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JASPER +++$+++ Are we going away, Daddy?
L328077 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Hi, Freckle Face.
L328076 +++$+++ u1566 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JASPER +++$+++ Daddy!  Where have you been?
L327642 +++$+++ u1566 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JASPER +++$+++ A rhinoceros.  Can I stay up another hour?
L327641 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
L327640 +++$+++ u1566 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JASPER +++$+++ Dad, look what I drew.
L327632 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers.  I'd catch hell.  And this is the alleged murderer of the President?
L327631 +++$+++ u1566 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JASPER +++$+++ Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
L328398 +++$+++ u1567 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JEAN HILL +++$+++ I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
L328397 +++$+++ u1571 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LAWYER +++$+++ Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
L328396 +++$+++ u1567 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JEAN HILL +++$+++ So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
L328395 +++$+++ u1571 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LAWYER +++$+++ I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
L328394 +++$+++ u1567 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JEAN HILL +++$+++ No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
L328393 +++$+++ u1571 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LAWYER +++$+++ ...you heard echoes.
L328392 +++$+++ u1567 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JEAN HILL +++$+++ The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
L328391 +++$+++ u1571 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LAWYER +++$+++ I want the truth.
L328390 +++$+++ u1567 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JEAN HILL +++$+++ Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
L328389 +++$+++ u1567 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JEAN HILL +++$+++ He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
L328388 +++$+++ u1567 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JEAN HILL +++$+++ No, you don't!
L328387 +++$+++ u1571 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LAWYER +++$+++ That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
L328386 +++$+++ u1567 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JEAN HILL +++$+++ Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
L328385 +++$+++ u1567 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JEAN HILL +++$+++ He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:
L328384 +++$+++ u1567 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JEAN HILL +++$+++ I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.
L328383 +++$+++ u1576 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
L328382 +++$+++ u1567 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JEAN HILL +++$+++ No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
L328381 +++$+++ u1567 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JEAN HILL +++$+++ ...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
L328380 +++$+++ u1576 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
L328379 +++$+++ u1567 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JEAN HILL +++$+++ Four to six.
L328378 +++$+++ u1576 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ How many shots you say you heard?
L328377 +++$+++ u1567 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JEAN HILL +++$+++ These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
L328578 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I know.
L328577 +++$+++ u1586 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SUSIE +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L328499 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone else?
L328498 +++$+++ u1586 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SUSIE +++$+++ Aren't you being a little hard?
L328449 +++$+++ u1586 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SUSIE +++$+++ This is interesting - are you ready for this?  Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination.  It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
L328448 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right?  It proves he's a liar.  Keep on it, Bill. 
L328238 +++$+++ u1586 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SUSIE +++$+++ Bugging the District Attorney's office of New Orleans!  It's outrageous!
L328237 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I don't believe it!
L327989 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Goddamn!  They put Oswald together from Day One!  Like some dummy corporation in the Bahamas - you just move him around a board.  Sent him to Russia, in and out, no passport problems.  You got the word "microdots" in his notebook, you got the Minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions, the sealed DIZ201 personnel file. For all we know, there could be a dozen Oswalds in different cities, countries - all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination.  Does the real Oswald know he's been put together?  Who knows.  It doesn't matter, does it?  He's a low level spy, he doesn't know who he really works for...
L327988 +++$+++ u1586 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SUSIE +++$+++ ...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name "Oswald" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.  The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?  Guy Banister.  Banister has someone using the name "Oswald" to buy the trucks.  Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald's passport and identity.
L327821 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "We both know who's responsible."  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?
L327820 +++$+++ u1586 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SUSIE +++$+++ All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
L327819 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.
L327818 +++$+++ u1586 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SUSIE +++$+++ The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams.  It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.
L327808 +++$+++ u1586 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ SUSIE +++$+++ Equally incongruous is Oswald becoming chummy with the White Russian community of Dallas - all rabid anti- Communists.
