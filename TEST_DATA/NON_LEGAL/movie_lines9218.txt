L349514 +++$+++ u1793 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Mom said I should.
L349513 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What's that for?
L349942 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Who are all these people?
L349941 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Atonement.
L349927 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh.  And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.
L349926 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom.
L349925 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Has he eaten anything at all?
L349924 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I'm going to bed.
L349768 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Uh...using Josh like that.
L349767 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Why?  What do you mean?
L349766 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I'm supposed to be mad at you, but I'm not.
L349765 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ I couldn't sleep last night.
L349764 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ What are you doing up so early?
L349747 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Oh God, we don't want the police!
L349746 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ You'd better call and cancel.
L349745 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
L349744 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ And why was the alarm on?
L349743 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ I couldn't get it to go down.
L349742 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ What's wrong?
L349741 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ I put him to work.
L349739 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Here, honey!
L349738 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Mom?
L349732 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I don't know...  More like when I kissed Sam.
L349731 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What did you think it would be?
L349730 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ It's not what I was expecting.
L349728 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Let's shut up and not kill her.
L349727 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ My mother would die.
L349725 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb.  Why did you do that?
L349724 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Did you feel anything?
L349723 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I've taken a lot of morphine.  Oral morphine...for my back.  Can I wait till I can say no and sound convincing?
L349722 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I want you to try something with me, okay?
L349721 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You have to ask like that?
L349720 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
L349719 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You're a good girl.
L349718 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
L349717 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
L349716 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
L349715 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Can you keep Sam straight?
L349124 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
L349123 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I had them in my pocket.
L349121 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ What's that?
L349120 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ My keys.
L349119 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Monday.
L349118 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What's today?
L349116 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Nope.
L349115 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Don't you have school?
L349114 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Is that legal?
L349113 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm living here while I build another house.
L349112 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
L349111 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Alyssa.
L348907 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
L348906 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Why?
L348905 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ No.
L348904 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Are you his friend?
L348903 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ He seems lonely.
L348902 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ He must.
L348900 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'll survive.
L348899 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Sorry I got you into trouble.
L349996 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ What?
L349995 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Floating to Catalina.
L349994 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Where are you?!
L349952 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't wanna go.
L349951 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.
L349950 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't wanna go.
L349935 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Not if what he left me was real.
L349934 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You'd hate him for the trick.
L349933 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
L349932 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You hate your father.
L349813 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ What?
L349812 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for two hours.
L349807 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Are you afraid of heights?
L349806 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ On the handlebars or your shoulders?
L349646 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Okay.  I guess.
L349645 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
L349644 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
L349643 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
L349642 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ It would help me if I could kiss you.
L349641 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I thought I was helping you.
L349640 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
L349639 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Not really.
L349638 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
L349637 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I was wondering.
L349635 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm not gay.
L349634 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Josh said...
L349633 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L349632 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Are you sure you're totally into guys?
L349631 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ It's freakish.  I don't get it.  I'm not really supposed to touch you, but I can look.
L349630 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Does everything have to have a point?
L349629 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What's the point of this?
L349496 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hand me a towel.  Hand me a towel.
L349495 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
L349494 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
L349493 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Why are you so uptight?
L349492 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Why are you so stupid?
L349491 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ We're not gonna do anything.
L349490 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't want you to!
L349489 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I'm coming in.
L349488 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.
L349487 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I've seen lots of people.  It's not a big thing for me.
L349485 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I'm just here to shower.
L349484 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.
L349483 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ He can peddle over anytime he wants to for it.
L349482 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
L349481 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Really?
L349480 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ His parents took his car.  They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.
L349479 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Not really.  No.  Kinda.  He got busted?
L349477 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I'm okay.
L349476 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I can use your mom's.
L349475 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Huh?
L349257 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No thanks.
L349256 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?
L349255 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Turn over.
L349254 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Why?
L349253 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I wanted him to marry her.
L349252 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Really?
L349251 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
L349250 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yeah.
L349249 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Do you remember me from when you lived here?
L349246 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No.  That's okay.
L349245 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I'll get your back.
L349244 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I might not stay, anyway.
L349243 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
L349242 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I can't even take a shower here.
L349241 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ You look better without make-up.
L349240 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ He's a freak.
L349221 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Tell him I said "hi".
L349220 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ He jumped into the ocean.
L349219 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Where's your dad?
L349218 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't know.
L349217 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ You should stay.
L349216 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you.
L349215 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't know.
L349214 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Your dad's really gonna build his house?
L349213 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
L349212 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Where to?
L349211 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ They're trying to make me spend the summer here.  I'm leaving in the morning.
L349210 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L349209 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hey.
L349208 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Hi.
L349207 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm hungry!  Where's my dinner?  Who ate my dinner?  Huh?  Who's in trouble now?
L349898 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ No.
L349897 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Will he talk to me?
L349896 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ He won't leave my room.
L349657 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ He's not the type to worry.
L349656 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
L349655 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Well, he doesn't need to worry.
L349654 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
L349653 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ He's at work while I'm here.
L349652 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
L349651 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Why is that?
L349528 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ He's got a standing invitation.
L349527 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.
L350001 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
L350000 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
L348926 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ He builds models for architects.  His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
L348925 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
L348924 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ George just never really...aimed that high.  Even with not hitting a rabbit.  I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun.  It was always like you were frightened.  Quiet and boring.
L348923 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I wouldn't want you as a friend.
L348919 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ I mean, but did you both go camping on weekends?  Listen to music?  Masturbate together?  Talk on the phone?
L348918 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ We've known each other since grade school.
L348917 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ Are you guys' friends?
L348914 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ You've been good this week.
L348913 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ It could have been a squirt gun.
L348912 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ And of course the Beck's, with the...
L348911 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ IPO's caused the rat population on this street.
L348910 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
L348909 +++$+++ u1794 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ALYSSA +++$+++ This is such a street of whiners.
L349919 +++$+++ u1795 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Months.
L349918 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ That would take weeks.
L349912 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ To the patio and one north-facing window...  And six inches to the height.
L349911 +++$+++ u1795 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
L349910 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I have the permit.
L349909 +++$+++ u1795 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Well, if it is, we have a problem.
L349908 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It's thirty feet.
L349907 +++$+++ u1795 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Mr. Stevens.  One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height.  He's filed to have construction stopped immediately.
L349426 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ If that's what it takes.
L349425 +++$+++ u1795 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
L349422 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I flushed it down the toilet.
L349421 +++$+++ u1795 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I hate to ask about a window.
L349413 +++$+++ u1795 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Allowed outside the enclosed area.
L349412 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ A sink?
L349411 +++$+++ u1795 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ An exhaust system or a window is code.
L349410 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ And if I enclosed it?
L349409 +++$+++ u1795 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Oh, yes.
L349408 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ A violation?
L349407 +++$+++ u1795 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Bob Larson.  Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen?
L349406 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I've been dreading you.
L349405 +++$+++ u1795 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Mr. Stevens?
L349017 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yes, it is.
L349016 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Well, it's the least I can do.
L349015 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Thank you.
L349014 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work.  I could maybe ask them if you could choose one.  But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours.  They're a part of this firm.  They inspire me.  I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed.  It amazes me. I would miss that too much.  Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.

I was wondering if I might be able to pick a few to keep, to take home?  Only the ones that really mean something to me.
L349012 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ What can I do for you, George?
L349011 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I've got one favor to ask.
L349010 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Good.  I was hoping for that.
L349009 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Well, I feel better about this now.
L349008 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ For everything.
L349007 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
L349006 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
