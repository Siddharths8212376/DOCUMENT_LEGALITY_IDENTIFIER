L377433 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ You're the memory guy?
L377432 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ I don't remember. See, I have no short-			* term memory. It's not amnesia -				   *
L377431 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ You tell me.
L377430 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Oh. But haven't we met before?
L377429 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Well, that's me.
L377428 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
L377427 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ What are you here for?
L377426 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ There's a dress code?
L377425 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Don't just waltz in here dressed like			  * that and order a beer.						  *
L377424 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ A BEER, please.
L377423 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ What do you want?
L377422 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Beer, please.
L377419 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ I remember my wife dying.
L377418 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ What?
L377417 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Dying.
L377416 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Sweet.
L377415 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ My wife.
L377411 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Thanks.
L377410 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ On the house.
L377397 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Thank you.
L377396 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.
L377395 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ * John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.						 *
L377394 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?
L377389 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Why not?
L377388 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ They're not looking for him.
L377387 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Can I ask you something?
L377386 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ * Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this -			*
L377380 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ About your whore of a wife?
L377379 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Don't say another fucking word!
L377376 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Shut the fuck up!
L377375 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
L377374 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Yes.
L377373 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?!
L377372 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
L377371 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
L377370 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Calm down.
L377369 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
L377368 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Don't talk about my wife.
L377365 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ That's different.
L377364 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
L377363 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
L377362 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Kill him. I'll pay you.
L377361 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ What?
L377360 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Get rid of Dodd for me.
L377359 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ How?
L377358 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Help me.
L377357 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ I'm not.
L377356 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Don't protect him.
L377355 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Neither do I.
L377354 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ What happened is that Jimmy went to meet a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back. Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't know whether you know this Teddy or how well -
L377353 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ What happened?
L377350 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ I have this condition -
L377349 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ You don't know, do you? You're blissfully ignorant, aren't you?
L377348 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ What's this all about?
L377347 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ No!
L377346 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Did you?
L377345 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
L377344 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ What does he want?
L377343 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Calls himself Dodd.
L377342 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Who?
L377341 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Somebody's come. Already.
L377340 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ What's wrong?
L377335 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!
L377334 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Why would you do that?
L377333 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ I told him about your car.
L377332 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Me? Why would he be interested in me?
L377330 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else.
L377329 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Yeah, I hated it.
L377328 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Yeah?
L377327 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ My wife used to call me Lenny.
L377326 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ He'll kill you, Lenny.
L377325 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.
L377324 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ And? 
L377323 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ I'll go see him.
L377322 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ What are you gonna do?
L377321 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Where is he?
L377320 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
L377319 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ And what did he say?
L377318 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ I did exactly what you told me. I went to		   * Dodd and I said that I didn't have				* Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.
L377314 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Who?! Fuck, Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me.
L377313 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Who?
L377125 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Maybe I can help you find him. I know a			* lot of people.
L377124 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Kill him.
L377123 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
L377122 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ What do the police think?
L377120 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Who did he go to meet?
L377119 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
L377118 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ What happened?
L377117 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ His name was Jimmy.
L377113 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Just relax.
L377112 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ It's not easy to be calm when -
L377109 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes.
L377108 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Your wife?
L377107 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
L377106 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Such as?
L377105 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ There are things you know for sure.
L377104 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
L377100 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Course not.
L377099 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Kill him.
L377098 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ What?
L377097 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Did you?
L377096 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
L377095 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Yes.
L377094 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ So I just take your word?
L377093 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
L377092 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ How do I know he did that to you?
L377091 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Leonard, you offered to help when you saw what this guy did to me.
L377090 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
L377089 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.
L377086 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Who is he? What have you got me into?
L377085 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
L377062 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Yeah. You?
L377061 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Sleep okay?
L376984 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ You know what we have in common?
L376983 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Don't remember.
L376982 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ They treating you alright?
L376978 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Sorry.
L376977 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ I wasn't helping you for money.
L376976 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
L376975 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ It's isolated.
L376974 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Deals?
L376973 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ I wrote an address in there, too. Might be useful. It's this abandoned place outside of town. I guy I know used to use it for his bigger deals.
L376970 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ She was beautiful. Perfect to me -				*
L376969 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
L376968 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Why?
L376967 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Tell me about her again.
L376966 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ * So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *
L376965 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
L376964 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Then you shouldn't have to ask.
L376963 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Yes.
L376962 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Have I told you what this man did?				*
L376961 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before
L376960 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ You know him?
L376957 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Must be tough living life according to a few scraps of paper. Mix up your laundry list and your grocery list, you'll be eating your underwear.
L376956 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Yes.
L376955 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Is that what your little note says?
L376954 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ So you have information for me?
L376953 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L376951 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ You told me.
L376950 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.
L376949 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ You did explain, Lenny.
L376948 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
L376947 +++$+++ u6567 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ You don't remember me.
L377309 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ She seemed to leave happy. I thought I'd helped her.
L377308 +++$+++ u6566 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ MRS. JANKIS +++$+++ Thank you.
L377307 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
L377306 +++$+++ u6566 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ MRS. JANKIS +++$+++ I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition.
L377305 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?
L377302 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Then why are you here?
L377301 +++$+++ u6566 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ MRS. JANKIS +++$+++ I'm not appealing the decision.
L377300 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
L377299 +++$+++ u6566 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ MRS. JANKIS +++$+++ I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
L377298 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
L377297 +++$+++ u6566 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ MRS. JANKIS +++$+++ Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking -
L377210 +++$+++ u6565 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD'S WIFE +++$+++ Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to annoy you, I enjoy it. Just let me read, please.
L377209 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
L377208 +++$+++ u6565 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD'S WIFE +++$+++ I enjoy it.
L377207 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ You've read it a hundred times.
