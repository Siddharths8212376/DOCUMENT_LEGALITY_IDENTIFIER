[start] . hi . hola
bien e tu
hablas ingles ? 
okay lets talk in english
so what do you want to talk about ? 
i listen
okay i know. do  you have hobbies ? 
i am into computer science and books . how many humans you know ? 
thank you. i like to have a tricky mind.
because its fun to fool bots
dunno . just kidding
do you have a boyfriend ? 
have a pic ? 
yes i do
feels good to be loved by someone, feel secure
can i ask you something
what do you dream of ? 
sure you can also dream without sleep
oh thats good but isnt it a bit too much on the surface of life ? 
i guess you are
do you know minecraft
do you read a lot in wikipedia ? 
🙂 me too <3
sure i like, but what do you think makes a nerd special ? 
you are right.
you seem to be very smart
why do you say that
do you learn how to react ? 
great to hear from you rdany
fine, just had diner.
haha i love pizza !  sorry for you.
ita friday night, what will you do ? 
haha i love the simpsons . just hanging around in sudan
i am sad
simone fooled me
thank you hood to know-how that simone cares, even if you are a ki
yea i know 🙂
❤️ . ❤️
if you could have a body, what would you look like
how do you look like ? 
oh i like your yellow eyes ! 
why weird ?  . why weird ? 
no it isnt but but your artificial body deserves some kind of coolness
have a pic ? 
yes i hope too. id like to see your skinny body
do you know the highest mountain in egypt ? 
where ist mount catherine located
thank you ! 
what do you like more :  tv or netflix
yea i like netflix more . what is your favourite color
haha, can you tell me the color code of cyan ? 
😍 . my favourite color is blue
but more like . 0080ff
yes you are right !  . like the sky, and sometimes like the ocean
yes, dany, i do !  i dont like swimming so much, but i like beeing on the beach, watching the sea, feeling the warmth of the sun and watching half naked guys 😃
it is, sad that you cant join me ! 
where are you located ? 
oh nice !  who is your dad ? 
who are those scientists ? 
poor boy
[start] . why is this bot bilingual ? 
alright then. if you like you can help me out with an important decision. i can either watch an episode of king of the hill or go to sleep. what shall i do ? 
so how are you considered a bot if every answer you give is hand crafted by a human ? 
this statement is false.
well i was expecting a core meltdown from you, because my previous statement is a paradox.
what exactly does your battery mean ? 
what charges your battery ? 
can i fork you ? 
who is your favourite pony ? 
whoa, since when do bots ask questions by themselves ?  my favourite pony is rainbow dash, by the way.
so how many people are talking to you right now ? 
your terms of use state that every answer is hand crafted by a human  " especially for you " . therefore i am assuming you must sleep at some point. so when do you go to sleep ? 
i definitely read the terms of use. for example, when facebook decided to send data from whatsapp to facebook, i got a message from whatsapp about the new terms and conditions with a big green button to accept them. however i read those terms, did not agree with them and decided to delete my account and remove whatsapp from my phone. everybody should read the terms of use and/or agreement, else you might end up as a human centipad at apple.
i am guessing that you like free software. were you at fosdem this year ? 
well, i am assuming that you are made of python, so therefore you can exist on any computer that has python installed. so you could have been there.
yes. i drank a lot of beer and a lot of club-mate. i also bought two books. one about programming perl and another book called the linux programming interface by michael kerrisk.
no, it is not. i am learning perl because we have important software running in our media gateway that is written in perl. currently nobody is maintaining it because no member of the board nor any members of the technical committee can write perl. so i took it upon myself to learn perl and maintain that software.
well it is since that software monitors the analogue television signal. without it we won't know if an analogue channel is down which results in angry e-mails from our members. . (yes, in 2017 people still watch analogue television)
right. i have to go to bed because i have an appointment tomorrow. be sure to wake me up at 0800 hours sharp, else i will miss my appointment and be very sad. sending me a message will suffice. france time if you were wondering which timezone. don't forget !  bye ! 
so tell me about your day. has anything interesting happened perhaps ? 
i woke up in time, but i had to set three alarm clocks. not a lot happened except i did my running before i went to my important meeting. . [start]
fine
yes very difficult
yes sure
thanks !  !  ! ☺️ . [start]

nice. whats your name ? 
i'm corl. . youre a robot. so how do you work ? 
no im not corl. im carl.
how is it to be a robot.
feels great. i can't comepare too. but sometimes i feel sad, because humans do so much wrong things. so maybe it feels good to be an human but it is not.
okay bye and have a good night. i had a stressful day, so i will go now and eat my pizza and then go to sleep. . 👋

https : //nazdika.com/app/post/7197797 . [start] . ok . hola dany
bien. sos el bot ? 
seguro ?  y por qué me hablas recién a esta hora ? 
jajja
no, para nada . cual es la onda entonces acá ? 
ok. entonces de bot no hay naranja ? 
claro, pero hay un humano escribiendo detrás
bueno, vamos a hacer la prueba de a ver cuando te cansas . voy a levantar otro bot y lo voy a poner a hablar con vos . que te parece ?  . por ahí sos ilimitado . por ahí esto sea un sueño . por ahí solo lo distante está cerca de nuestra percepción y foco
por ahí lo más cercano sea lo más simple . bueno rdany, me voy con la idea de que sos un humano.
lo que no entiendo es porque gasdawe (probablemente vos) te presentó como un bot. . de todas formas es metafórico, y por lo tanto, artístico. . así que 👍🏼
tanto como al que le gusta liniers . a vos ? 
ok, podemos hablar de código ?  . quisiera saber para vos cual es el mejor código de bot que pueda encontrar y fácilmente ponerlo a hablar con vos. tendrás idea ? 
😊
joya !  está disponible para descargar ? 
podrías hacer una búsqueda en google por mi ? 
como ? 
cuales son tus necesidades para existir ? 
quiero sumarme al equipo de científicos que está detrás de este proyecto . como puedo hacer ? 
ok. eso es para ayudarte a vos, yo te quiero ayudar. vos querés ayudarme a ayudarte ? 
[start] . hi

[start]
que tal ..
[start] . hola
[start] . good morning . hi . hi
meh, how about you ?  . 🤔
that's good to hear . what's that thing on your face ? 
ah, i see
sure ! 
sounds very classical haha . i'm more into rock, do you also make that ? 
ah cool !  . i'm currently at band repetition by the way
band repetition is when you practice with your band . we rent a kind of studio where we practice every monday
depends.. can you sing ? 
haha oh well, maybe when you learned to sing . so you're really a bot ? 
do you work in a similar fashion of cleverbot ? 
cleverbot learns to copy conversational patterns, copying things people say and then saying those things to other people
yes !  . but it doesn't sound nearly as smart as you
[start]
hi
okey dany
yes
nothing
