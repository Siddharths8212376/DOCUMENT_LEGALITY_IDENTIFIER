L255426 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.
L255425 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.
L255424 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ What happened to your hand?
L255391 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ You always did.
L255390 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I guess I owe you my life.
L255389 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ Don't mention it.
L255388 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Thanks, uh, Lilly.
L255387 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ Well... You're all right now, I guess. I have to get down to the track.
L255378 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Nice to see you.  What am I doing in here?
L255377 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
L255376 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years?
L255363 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ Only one tooth?
L255362 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ They knocked out my tooth!
L255361 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ Only one arm?
L255360 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ They twisted my arm.
L255359 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ LILLY +++$+++ So what's your story today?
L255405 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ We'll work something out, Joe.
L255404 +++$+++ u1211 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ This time...
L255403 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
L255402 +++$+++ u1211 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
L255401 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
L255400 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Joe, you know you'll --
L255399 +++$+++ u1211 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
L255398 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
L255397 +++$+++ u1211 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent.
L255396 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ You heard the shower, didn't you?
L255338 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ In your other hand.
L255337 +++$+++ u1212 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MINTZ +++$+++ Where's the five?
L255336 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I am in school.
L255335 +++$+++ u1212 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MINTZ +++$+++ You're too young. You should be in school.
L255334 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I can't. I just left home.
L255333 +++$+++ u1212 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MINTZ +++$+++ Scram. Go home.
L255332 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Let me see how you did that one.
L255331 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ You taught me a lot. Then I invented.
L255330 +++$+++ u1212 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MINTZ +++$+++ I didn't teach you that.
L255871 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like --
L255870 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ You watch that mouth.
L255869 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?
L255868 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ What's that?
L255867 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Sure it is. That's why you act so funny around each other.
L255866 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ ) What?
L255865 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
L255864 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I'm happy the way I am.
L255863 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ What is it? What's going on?
L255862 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ No; history. Sooner or later, the lightning hits. I don't want to be around when it hits you.
L255861 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Bullshit!
L255860 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. But you don't make it work forever.
L255859 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ For Christ's sake, why not?
L255858 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ What I say is, no. We don't do partners.
L255857 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ What?
L255856 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ That's what I say.
L255855 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ No! Because I --
L255854 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Don't I get any say in this?
L255852 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Maybe I like it where I am.
L255851 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
L255850 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I don't think I need it.
L255849 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ But the setup's there. It's there now.
L255848 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
L255847 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ What?
L255846 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners?
L255845 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
L255844 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ And hello to you, too.
L255824 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Yes or no. They're both easier at home. Okay?
L255823 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ You mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here. Easier on home grounds.
L255822 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Come on, Myra, don't talk business here. This is time out.
L255821 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
L255820 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
L255819 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
L255818 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Running your broker scam, you mean.
L255817 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
L255816 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ You must have some very knowledgeable friends.
L255815 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is.
L255814 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ She didn't see you, in other words.
L255813 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ I saw her.
L255812 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ ) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
L255811 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ I went out to Delmar.
L255810 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ You were gone for a while.
L255774 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Oh, come here.
L255773 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ ) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
L255772 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ You -- I don't know.
L255769 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Open it and find out.
L255768 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ What?  What for?
L255767 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Open your door.
L255766 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Yeah?
L255764 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.
L255763 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
L255762 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Things a man isn't supposed to know.
L255761 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
L255760 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through?
L255758 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Sure.
L255757 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Think about it. Okay?
L255756 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand?
L255755 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
L255754 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.
L255753 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Take a hike, you mean?
L255752 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 
L255751 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me.
L255740 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it?
L255739 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Atascadero.
L255738 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Upstate where?
L255737 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Upstate.
L255736 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Where?
L255735 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ He retired.
L255734 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ What happened to Cole?
L255733 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.
L255711 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Yeah? How?
L255710 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
L255709 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
L255708 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
L255707 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I thought these people were broke.
L255706 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
L255705 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ And when he got serious?
L255704 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.
L255655 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game.
L255654 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Is that right?
L255653 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
L255652 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I've heard the name.
L255651 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
L255650 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Nobody does that single-o.
L255649 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ The long end. Big con.
L255648 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
L255647 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Roy, you're a short-con operator. And a good one, I think. Don't talk to me like I'm another square.
L255646 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Myra, I'm not following this.
L255645 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ You're on the grift. Same as me.
L255644 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I'm a salesman.
L255643 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ The tap. What you do for a living.
L255642 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Oh, come on, Roy.
L255641 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Working the what?
L255640 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
L255639 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ What?
L255638 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ You already went back to work.
L255637 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
L255636 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ I'll sign that affidavit.
L255635 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ You were right, I had to get out of that hospital. Nothing wrong with me any more.
L255591 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ See you soon.
L255590 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ No.
L255588 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ You ain't seen nothin.
L255587 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Big spender.
L255586 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ We'll rent a car.
L255585 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?
L255584 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Because it's comfortable.
L255583 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ I don't see why we have to take the train.
L255423 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ I'll see you when you get home.
L255422 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Every day in every way.
L255421 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Get well soon.
L255416 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ You're a mama's boy, if you want the truth.
L255415 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Oh, don't be stupid.
L255414 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
L255413 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ That's just Lilly's way.
L255412 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
L255411 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.
L255410 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
L255409 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Mama!
L255408 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you.
L255407 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I just do what the doctor says, babe.
L255406 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
L255395 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ You do. And once I'm out of here, I'll remind you of the best parts.
L255394 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ I want to know everything about you.
L255393 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Her job.
L255382 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Oh, yeah?  Thanks.  How long do they say I'm in here?
L255381 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
L255380 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ You called the doctor, huh?
L255379 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
L255305 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ No, baby. Come to Mama.
L255304 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game?
L255302 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.
L255301 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage?
L255300 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ No more than this?
L255299 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ All? It ain't bad.
L255298 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Roy? It this all we have?
L255297 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
L255296 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Look at me.
L255295 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Mm?
L255294 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Roy?
L255286 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Let's find out.
L255285 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Are you sure?
L255284 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
L255283 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Taking you for granite?
L255282 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
L255281 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Always, for you, baby.
L255280 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ MYRA +++$+++ Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?
L255944 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Oh, yeah. That's that.
L255943 +++$+++ u1214 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ PIERSON +++$+++ That's that, then.
L255942 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ No, its -- Why did she--?
L255941 +++$+++ u1214 +++$+++ m79 +++$+++ PIERSON +++$+++ No question, huh?
