L129262 +++$+++ u4464 +++$+++ m295 +++$+++ SCENE +++$+++ INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
L129261 +++$+++ u4467 +++$+++ m295 +++$+++ VITELLI +++$+++  We've gotta take out Brynner's van before  they reach...
L129752 +++$+++ u4468 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ BARNEY +++$+++ So anyway, he says, 'whyn't you do what the Chinese do?'
L129751 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ An honest living.
L129750 +++$+++ u4468 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ BARNEY +++$+++ 'Course you do, Jake.
L129749 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact – it surprised me it was so quick. I make an honest living.
L129746 +++$+++ u4468 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ BARNEY +++$+++ Jake, for Christ's sake.
L129745 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
L129744 +++$+++ u4468 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ BARNEY +++$+++ Take it easy, Jake.
L129743 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Barney, who is this bimbo? He a regular customer?
L129733 +++$+++ u4468 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ BARNEY +++$+++ Heat's murder.
L129732 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Look at that.
L130274 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ The print's pretty fine. I forgot my glasses. I'd like to be able to read across.
L130273 +++$+++ u4469 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ A ruler?
L130272 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Well, then, how about a ruler?
L130271 +++$+++ u4469 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records.
L130270 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Can I check one of these volumes out?
L130269 +++$+++ u4469 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ If that's what it says.
L130268 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
L130267 +++$+++ u4469 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ That's right.
L130266 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Then these are all new owners?
L130265 +++$+++ u4469 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.
L130264 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
L130261 +++$+++ u4469 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ Row twenty-three, section C.
L130260 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I'll settle for L.A. County.
L130730 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Who do you blame for that? Her?
L130729 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
L130728 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
L130727 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ Oh, my, yes.
L130726 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
L130725 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ I have no idea. How much do you want?
L130724 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ How much are you worth?
L130723 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.
L130722 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ How do you do that?
L130721 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
L130720 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.
L130719 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
L130718 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
L130717 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
L130716 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Haven't the faintest idea.
L130715 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
L130714 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ ...the coroner's report showed Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.
L130712 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
L130711 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ What does this mean?
L130710 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ Yes... I think I can manage...
L130709 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ An obituary column... can you read in this light?
L130708 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ What is it?
L130707 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross.
L130705 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ With her mother.
L130704 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ Where is she?
L130703 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ She's fine.
L130702 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ Is she all right?
L130701 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I've got her.
L130700 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ Well, you don't look any the worse for wear, Mr. Gittes, I must say... where's the girl?...
L130257 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
L130256 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ Avocado groves?
L130255 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
L130254 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ Just find the girl.
L130253 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
L130252 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
L130251 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ How did you find out?
L130250 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
L130249 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
L130248 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized.
L130247 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I didn't realize you and Hollis were so fond of each other.
L130246 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.
L130245 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ What about her?
L130244 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ My daughter.
L130243 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about?
L130242 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Well, It was about five days ago. You were outside the Pig 'n Whistle and you had one hell of an argument.
L130241 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ At my age, you tend to lose track...
L130240 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Yeah. Do you remember the last time you talked to Mulwray?
L130239 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection. I let 'em practice up out here.
L130238 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ When was the last time?
L130237 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ No.
L130236 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
L130235 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
L130234 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Maybe.
L130233 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
L130232 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ No. She's probably scared to death.
L130231 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ Doesn't that strike you as odd?
L130230 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Yeah.
L130229 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
L130228 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
L130227 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ Yes, his girlfriend.
L130226 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ His girlfriend?
L130225 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ 'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
L130224 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
L130223 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ ...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?
L130222 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ Was he right?
L130221 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
L130220 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ Why is that funny?
L130219 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.
L130218 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ What for?
L130217 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
L130216 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.
L130215 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ Are you sleeping with her? Come, come, Mr. Gittes. You don't have to think about that to remember, do you?
L130214 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
L130213 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking, of course. How much are you charging her?
L130212 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Too bad?
L130211 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ That's too bad.
L130210 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ None.
L130209 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
L130208 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
L130207 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ Honest?
L130206 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Very.
L130205 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ Would you call him a capable man?
L130204 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ We worked in Chinatown together.
L130203 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ Where from?
L130202 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Oh yes.
L130201 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ Do you know him?
L130200 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Lou Escobar – he's a Lieutenant.
L130199 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ Who's the investigating officer?
L130198 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ They're calling it an accident.
L130197 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ Tell me. What do the police say?
L130196 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.
L130194 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I think I gave it to her.
L130193 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ How did she get that idea?
L130192 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.
L130191 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
L130190 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Probably.
L130189 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
L130188 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ It doesn't hurt.
L130187 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising.
L130186 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Thanks.
L130185 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.
L130183 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ What?  Oh, damn near yes. Unless the animal's sick or something.  And the steam rising off it like that in the morning. That's life, Mr. Gittes. Life.
L130182 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Always?
L130179 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Yes, sir, that's what it looks like. I'll give you that.
L130178 +++$+++ u4470 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS +++$+++ I said horseshit.  Horseshit.
L130177 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Sir?
L130570 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Just bring your checkbook.
L130569 +++$+++ u4471 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS' VOICE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L130568 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Either that or she'll be in jail.
L130567 +++$+++ u4471 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS' VOICE +++$+++ Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
L130566 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
L130565 +++$+++ u4471 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS' VOICE +++$+++ Of course I do. Where are you?
L130564 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Do you remember the figures we discussed?
L130563 +++$+++ u4471 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS' VOICE +++$+++ You've got her? Where?
L130562 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.
L130561 +++$+++ u4471 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CROSS' VOICE +++$+++ Hello.
L130698 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Curly, you know how long I been in business.
L130697 +++$+++ u4472 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CURLY +++$+++ You sure this is okay?
L130696 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. Then if I don't show, take her down to the boat.
L130695 +++$+++ u4472 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CURLY +++$+++ Okay, you got yourself a boat.
L130694 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I'll throw that in too.
L130693 +++$+++ u4472 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CURLY +++$+++ Plus what I owe you?
L130692 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
L130691 +++$+++ u4472 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CURLY +++$+++ I don't know...
L130690 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
L130689 +++$+++ u4472 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CURLY +++$+++ Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
L130688 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ How much do you owe me, Curly?
L130684 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Tell her later.
L130683 +++$+++ u4472 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CURLY +++$+++ I'll just tell my wife.
L130682 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
L130681 +++$+++ u4472 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CURLY +++$+++ Sure, as soon as we eat.
L130680 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Could you drive me somewhere?
L130679 +++$+++ u4472 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CURLY +++$+++ Off the alley.
L130678 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Where's that?
L130677 +++$+++ u4472 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CURLY +++$+++ In the garage.
L130676 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Curly, where's your car?
L130675 +++$+++ u4472 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CURLY +++$+++ Sure thing.
L130672 +++$+++ u4472 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CURLY +++$+++ How about a glass of wine? Honey, this is...
L130671 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ No thanks.
L130670 +++$+++ u4472 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CURLY +++$+++ Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
L130669 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Call me Jake. How is everything?
L130668 +++$+++ u4472 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CURLY +++$+++ Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes.
L129667 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Call me Jake. Careful driving home, Curly.
L129666 +++$+++ u4472 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CURLY +++$+++ Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
L129665 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ What kind of guy do you think I am?
L129663 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...
L129662 +++$+++ u4472 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CURLY +++$+++ I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
L129661 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ You bet your ass you don't. You can't even pay me off.
L129660 +++$+++ u4472 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CURLY +++$+++ ...No...
L129658 +++$+++ u4472 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ CURLY +++$+++ Not for your wife. That's the unwritten law.
