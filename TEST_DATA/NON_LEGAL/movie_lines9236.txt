L381925 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Jesus Christ...
L381924 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Get back in the car!
L381923 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Jesus...
L381919 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ That's the Loch Ness Monster.  And... Kay-- that's... 444-Eyes?
L381918 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Ernie Goose?  Cynthia?
L381900 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I think that's what's happening...
L381899 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ You think that's what's-happening?
L381898 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
L381897 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ The radio show?
L381896 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
L381895 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ What's going on, Kay?
L381873 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Where to?
L381872 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Looks like a train ticket.
L381871 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ What?
L381870 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ And what's this ... ?
L381869 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
L381868 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.
L381867 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why?
L381866 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Gee.  You really think?
L381865 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Something's wrong here.
L381831 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ There's a god damn good reason.
L381830 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
L381829 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ He's a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is.
L381802 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Hold it.
L381801 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
L381800 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.
L381796 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid.  They use it to make our food digestible for their systems.
L381795 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Now what?
L381792 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ A what?
L381791 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
L381790 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
L381789 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?
L381787 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.
L381786 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ what's this?
L381776 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Let's check am out.
L381775 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
L381774 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
L381773 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
L381772 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Something seem unusual to you about that?
L381771 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ What?
L381749 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD.  Jay winces.
L381748 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ?
L381747 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Um-- Kay?
L381746 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ You don't know me at all.
L381745 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
L381744 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Why?
L381743 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Well, one thing's for sure.  You could certainly lighten up.
L381741 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ It was a long time ago.-
L381740 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Ha ha.  No, really.
L381739 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I taught kindergarten.
L381738 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
L381737 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ You don't know the half of it.
L381736 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I think you're too used to it.  If you ask me, you've been doing this job too long.
L381735 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  Believe me, you get used to it.
L381734 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I know, I know.  I read the manual. No attachments.  We work alone. Blah. blah.
L381733 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
L381732 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
L381731 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
L381730 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
L381729 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ She didn't even know you. .
L381728 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.
L381694 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I'm, uh... real curious about your met up here. I see you have the, uh, double-office-type thing going here..
L381693 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Keep her out of here while I check it out.
L381692 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I think she's the alien.  In any case, she's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room.
L381668 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ This is a college?  I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival.
L381667 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I know, but we're on a college campus...
L381666 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
L381665 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.
L381660 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Well, first of all... I gotta think we could still blend in pretty nice in a Ferrari Testerrosa.  I mean, there is a lot of `em on the street these days, and... uh...
L381659 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ So what's the problem?
L381658 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
L381655 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ But not a BUG bug-- it's an insect.
L381654 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Right.
L381653 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ It's a bug.
L381650 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
L381649 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
L381648 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Oh. Right.  I guess that's kind of cool, too, in it's own way.  Course, this isn't really black; it's kind of a dull, dirty, tarry sort of noncolor, isn't it?
L381647 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ We wear black.
L381646 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space.  Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity.
L382030 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?
L382029 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
L382022 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Me, too.  I feel a long day coming on.
L382021 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Sure.
L382013 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ You know, there's something we never really thought of...
L382012 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
L381938 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Why does it feel like the only thing scarier than having a bunch of aliens on the planet... is having then leave the planet?
L381937 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
L381936 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I'm just wondering what's so great out there that everyone's trying to get to it?
L382236 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.
L382235 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Yeah ... ?
L382234 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ They respond to fear, right?
L382233 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ What are you doing?
L382230 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Are you sure you don't?
L382229 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
L382228 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
L382227 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Okay.  If you've got a bug problem-a big one.  And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?
L382189 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Out of focus?
L382188 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
L382157 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Actually... I don't know.
L382156 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ What the hell does that mean?
L382155 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ What do we do?    Lean into it.
L382154 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ What do we do?
L382110 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ So... how did they get here?
L382109 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
L382108 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ When?
L382099 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
L382098 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
L382097 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
L382096 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ What is it?
L382095 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...
L382075 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Well, first of all, it's entomologist.
L382074 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Why not?
L382073 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
L382072 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
L382071 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
L382068 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Actually, you may have.
L382067 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
L381710 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Do have any idea what I just said?
L381709 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
L381708 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
L381707 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Right, right-- I like that stuff.
L381698 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Yeah, right.  Even I can barely read all my work.
L381697 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
L381696 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ So... how'd you hear about this?
L381683 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I'd prefer if you were just a little more blunt.
L381682 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare.  I really like that.  Let the other girls have the guys like you. Chiseled jaw, perfect nose, quirky dimples.  I find you all so boring.
L381681 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Actually, they disgust me.  But that's what I love about them.  Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?
L381680 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ So, I guess you could say you're really into insects...
L381864 +++$+++ u1905 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JEEBS +++$+++ You're not taking me in!
L381863 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Let's go, Jeebs.  Downtown.
L381853 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ And I'm bringing you in and locking you up until you tell me--
L381852 +++$+++ u1905 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JEEBS +++$+++ Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
L381851 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ And I'm arranging deportation papers.
L381850 +++$+++ u1905 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JEEBS +++$+++ I understand.  I understand, thank you. --How about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser?
L381849 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Your licence is revoked. Permanently.
L381847 +++$+++ u1905 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JEEBS +++$+++ I figured it didn't matter.  It's my last day of business.   I was wrong.  I'm sorry.  Hey, look what I got for you-- a free-floating plasma pad? --One of the good ones, too, with zoids.
L381846 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ You figured what?
L381845 +++$+++ u1905 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JEEBS +++$+++ The kid looked desperate.  I figured...
L381839 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Maybe you need a closer look.
L381838 +++$+++ u1905 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JEEBS +++$+++ No.
L381837 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ What a coincidence, cause I was just thinking about you, too, Jack.  Recognize this?
L382195 +++$+++ u1912 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ YAZ +++$+++ Most entirely.  Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated.
L382194 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Goodwill...
L382179 +++$+++ u1912 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ YAZ +++$+++ Give or take.  It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last.  We were waiting till your planet was warm enough.
L382178 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Not bad.  Briliiant, actually.  You come unarmed, and alone.  Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?
L381997 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ No-- a Person is smart.  People are dumb.    And the more people you put together, the dumber they get.  And you know that.
L381996 +++$+++ u1912 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ YAZ +++$+++ Come on now.  People are smart.
L381995 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
L381994 +++$+++ u1912 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ YAZ +++$+++ How could it not?
L381993 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help?
L381430 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ What are you talking about, it's coming?  What's coming?
L381429 +++$+++ u1909 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ It's... coming.
L381428 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
L381427 +++$+++ u1909 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ I dunno. One?
L381426 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Oh yeah?  Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to?  You know how many rules you've just broken?
L381425 +++$+++ u1909 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Yeah, wall, you know, I was just going there... to pick then up.
L381424 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
L381423 +++$+++ u1909 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Er. well, nowhere special.
L381422 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
L381421 +++$+++ u1909 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Nowhere.
L382130 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Cause I think we're looking at it.
L382129 +++$+++ u1914 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED'S VOICE +++$+++ How'd you know that?  Kay?
L382128 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
L382127 +++$+++ u1914 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED'S VOICE +++$+++ Actually, yeah--
L382126 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Did he say where?
L382125 +++$+++ u1914 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED'S VOICE +++$+++ Noon exactly.
L382124 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
L382123 +++$+++ u1914 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED'S VOICE +++$+++ Yeah, Kay?
L382122 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I know what this is.    Zed, you in?
L381702 +++$+++ u1914 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED'S VOICE +++$+++ Nope.  Nothing at all.
L381701 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Nothing at all?  Now?  Last month? Anything in the last few years?
L381700 +++$+++ u1914 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED'S VOICE +++$+++ Nothing.
L381699 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ ... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?
L381473 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Yeah, I'll talk to you.
L381472 +++$+++ u1914 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED'S VOICE +++$+++ We've got about eight or nine prospects	I want you look--
L381471 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ So... now what?  Cattle call again?
L381822 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ This guy.  Where was he?
L381821 +++$+++ u1908 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...
L381819 +++$+++ u1908 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ I promised I wouldn't tell.
L381818 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Tell us the truth.  You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood.
L381817 +++$+++ u1908 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Found it.
L381812 +++$+++ u1908 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ I wanna make a deal.
L381811 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
L381810 +++$+++ u1908 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Will it lower the curve?
L381809 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
L381808 +++$+++ u1908 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ What if I don't?
L381807 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
L381806 +++$+++ u1908 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ They're not my pals--
L381805 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
L382142 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Wait-- listen--
L382141 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Really nice wheels, by the way.
L382078 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.
L382077 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Which way?
L382063 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ The what?
L382062 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ We need to talk to you about the alien.
L381725 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ But, unfortunately, you're even less attracted to guys you've never seen before.
L381724 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--
L381716 +++$+++ u1907 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Come again?
L381715 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ We're with the immigration and Naturalization Service, Intergalactic Bureau.  We monitor all-alien activity in and around Earth and its enveloping atmosphere.
