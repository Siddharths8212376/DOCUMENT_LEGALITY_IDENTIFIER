L120380 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ She asleep?
L120379 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.
L120374 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
L120373 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.
L120333 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ This peter's a motherfucker.
L120332 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What's takin' so long over there?
L120331 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Sometimes I used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off lookin' at me, so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around.
L120210 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You go over there right now and you apologize. You better hope he lets you back in.
L120209 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ Get up.
L120208 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Come here, come here.

L119926 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ Smarten up.
L119906 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ Of course.
L119905 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
L119904 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Ace saw Vegas one way.
L119859 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hold it, hold it. Here.

L119663 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ 'Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten...
L119662 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ Well, how come I laid nine?
L120511 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Kill you,  You motherfucker you!  Frankie, do him a fuckin' favor.

L120505 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name!
L120502 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ This motherfucker, do you believe this? Two fuckin' days and nights!  Fuck me?
L120501 +++$+++ u4371 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ TONY DOGS +++$+++ Fuck you!
L120500 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.
L119925 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck around, Tony.
L119924 +++$+++ u4370 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ My fuckin' head.
L119923 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?!
L119922 +++$+++ u4370 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it.
L119921 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Maybe if I stick your fuckin' face through this window over here like, you know, you'll - you'll get unconfused. Give me the fuckin' money!
L119920 +++$+++ u4370 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Yeah.
L119919 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You're a little confused?
L119918 +++$+++ u4370 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Well, I'm a little confused here.
L119917 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'm positive.
L119916 +++$+++ u4370 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ You sure?
L119915 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
L119914 +++$+++ u4370 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
L119913 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
L119912 +++$+++ u4370 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ How you doin'?
L119911 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ How you doin'?
L119910 +++$+++ u4370 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Hey.

L121015 +++$+++ u4365 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ Do I hear a motion seconded?
L121014 +++$+++ u4360 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ OSCAR +++$+++ Denying?
L121013 +++$+++ u4365 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ ...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
L121012 +++$+++ u4360 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ OSCAR +++$+++ No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
L121011 +++$+++ u4365 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...
L121002 +++$+++ u4362 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO'S MOTHER +++$+++ Then do it the way you want.
L121001 +++$+++ u4361 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO +++$+++ ...done right, you gotta do it yourself.
L120993 +++$+++ u4362 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO'S MOTHER +++$+++ You are right. What can I...
L120992 +++$+++ u4361 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO +++$+++ ...everything's comin' out of my pocket. I gotta pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth.
L120985 +++$+++ u4361 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO +++$+++ You know, I - I'm too upset right now. And - An end has to be put to this.
L120984 +++$+++ u4362 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO'S MOTHER +++$+++ You'll get a heart attack like that.
L120983 +++$+++ u4361 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO +++$+++ All right, all right. But I - I -
L120982 +++$+++ u4362 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO'S MOTHER +++$+++ Take it easy, though.
L120981 +++$+++ u4361 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO +++$+++ I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth.
L120980 +++$+++ u4362 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO'S MOTHER +++$+++ I know it, I know it.
L120979 +++$+++ u4361 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO +++$+++ You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
L120978 +++$+++ u4362 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO'S MOTHER +++$+++ I know, but that's enough.
L120977 +++$+++ u4361 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO +++$+++ Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
L120976 +++$+++ u4362 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO'S MOTHER +++$+++ All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
L120975 +++$+++ u4361 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO +++$+++ ...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
L120974 +++$+++ u4361 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO +++$+++ I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...
L120966 +++$+++ u4361 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L120965 +++$+++ u4362 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO'S MOTHER +++$+++ That's enough.
L120964 +++$+++ u4361 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO +++$+++ I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
L120963 +++$+++ u4362 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO'S MOTHER +++$+++ Again!
L120962 +++$+++ u4361 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO +++$+++ Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
L120961 +++$+++ u4362 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO'S MOTHER +++$+++ There's a lot of people here.
L120960 +++$+++ u4361 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L120959 +++$+++ u4362 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO'S MOTHER +++$+++ Since when do you talk like that?
L120958 +++$+++ u4361 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO +++$+++ Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
L120957 +++$+++ u4362 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO'S MOTHER +++$+++ What's the matter with you?
L120956 +++$+++ u4361 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO +++$+++ Oh, sorry -
L120955 +++$+++ u4362 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO'S MOTHER +++$+++ Hey! Oh!
L120036 +++$+++ u4374 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WINNER +++$+++ Uh, I have a plane to catch to Cleveland...  Can I get my winnings?
L120035 +++$+++ u4366 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SHERBERT +++$+++ You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
L120034 +++$+++ u4374 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WINNER +++$+++ Yes, uh...
L120033 +++$+++ u4366 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SHERBERT +++$+++ Having a good time?
L120032 +++$+++ u4374 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WINNER +++$+++ Hi.
L120027 +++$+++ u4366 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SHERBERT +++$+++ Why don't I take him over to the office and verify it, huh?
L120026 +++$+++ u4374 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WINNER +++$+++ Yeah.
L120025 +++$+++ u4366 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SHERBERT +++$+++ Hiya. That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.
L123456 +++$+++ u4378 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GOD +++$+++ Adonis, be polite. She's a friend.
L123455 +++$+++ u4375 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ ADONIS +++$+++ Yew'll be ovah in the naxt tehn minutes...
L123454 +++$+++ u4378 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GOD +++$+++ I'm not going to worry about it. We are quite beyond the computer disc. Everything will be over within the next hour or so.
L123168 +++$+++ u4375 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ ADONIS +++$+++ I don't know about you, guys, but I'm getting a little buzz off this.
L123167 +++$+++ u4378 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GOD +++$+++ Works for me.
L123155 +++$+++ u4375 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ ADONIS +++$+++ Ayy!  Some cat's blocking the periscope.  Somebody, give it a swat...
L123154 +++$+++ u4378 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GOD +++$+++ Have we reached the epi-center?
L123013 +++$+++ u4378 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GOD +++$+++ It's okay. Let her go.
L123012 +++$+++ u4375 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ ADONIS +++$+++ Oh Man, not the sewer, I just had this cape cleaned...
L122943 +++$+++ u4378 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GOD +++$+++ You have to dial nine first.
L122942 +++$+++ u4375 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ ADONIS +++$+++ I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?
L122941 +++$+++ u4378 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GOD +++$+++ Do I have to remind everyone that in two days, we'll all be dead. The Cult of Good will be a memory. I don't want to hear about lawsuits or cereals. We have a secret mission...
L122937 +++$+++ u4378 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GOD +++$+++ Crowd always buys it. What do we got?
L122936 +++$+++ u4375 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ ADONIS +++$+++ The crowd bought it.
L122859 +++$+++ u4375 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ ADONIS +++$+++ Sorry, sir. The Cult is my life and my life is the Cult. By God, Captain God, I shall not fail you..
L122858 +++$+++ u4378 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GOD +++$+++ Hey, Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock...
L123460 +++$+++ u4377 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ CACTUS +++$+++ Yeah, all those women who went feline this afternoon...They're so ashamed now..
L123459 +++$+++ u4375 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ ADONIS +++$+++ You know, nobody likes you...
L123444 +++$+++ u4377 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ CACTUS +++$+++ That's a good one, dude. He says we're going to kill you whether you tell us where the disc is or not.
L123443 +++$+++ u4375 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ ADONIS +++$+++ 
L123195 +++$+++ u4377 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ CACTUS +++$+++ Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.
L123194 +++$+++ u4375 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ ADONIS +++$+++ Ah, Cats. Now and Forever.
L122986 +++$+++ u4377 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ CACTUS +++$+++ This looks promising...
L122985 +++$+++ u4375 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ ADONIS +++$+++ I thought we were going to take it easy until the Mission...
L122954 +++$+++ u4377 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ CACTUS +++$+++ Oops--my face must match my cape. And to think we were going to let you go...
L122953 +++$+++ u4375 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ ADONIS +++$+++ Cactus, I can't believe you just said all that...
L123525 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ I lied.
L123524 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ I thought you said you weren't a very good liar.
L123520 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ We'll hunt him down together...
L123519 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ In many ways, that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain...
L123518 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ You're serious?  You'd help me...
L123517 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
L123516 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
L123515 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ Somewhere very far away, very quiet, and very...  This is all wonderful, Selina, but...But I'm afraid I can not rest until all my sister's killers are brought to justice...That one-armed monster..
L123514 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?
L123511 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ A couple that battles the forces of evil together is a couple that stays together.  Thank you, Jeff.
L123510 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ Quite a pair we make. Thank you, Jeff.
L123428 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..
L123427 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--
L123411 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ You're telling the truth. I can tell..How did this..
L123410 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Hmm. Not bad.
L123407 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ What did you say?  Selina, sit down, the entire city is going crazy...You have to just calm down...
L123406 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Tonight, somewhere in the city, innocent people will die--but then one of you knows that; for one of you is a vicious pirate-terrorist posing as the beloved superhero Captain God.
L123293 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Uh Brock, today you are without me...
L123292 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
L123291 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
L123290 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
L123289 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
L123288 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ Selina, did you make it home, all right?  I tried calling, but your mother said that there was "no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means..
L123145 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ I'm sure.
L123144 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ Are you sure?
L123143 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
L123142 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ This is insane. Let the heroes handle it.  I'd better get you home...I should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit...
L123141 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Well, it's just that I would think that the woman who is the real, non- imitation Catwoman would be pretty angry at some little amateur minx stealing the whole whip idea. Really angry.
L123140 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ What's the matter?  What are you saying?
L123139 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ A whip?  Now that's going too far!  Some of these women have no shame!
L123138 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ No it's not.
L123137 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ What little boy doesn't...  My God...it's, it's...Catwoman.
L123136 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ I'm sorry I went off like that, I get passionate. I--I guess I'm a passionate person. One of those things I had forgotten.  When you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero?
L123135 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ So, did you see "Seinfeld" last week? That Kramer-guy really makes me laugh.
L123134 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side.  Ooh, she has a dark side." Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night." If you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a "duality" conversation.
L123133 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ I despise these kind of winds. Sorry, I guess I'm a little on edge. Seems this Catwoman has everyone, men and women, on edge. Don't you feel Catwoman says something about the duality of all men and women...
L123132 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ You're very special. Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors, but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one..
L123131 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
L123130 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
L123129 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
L123128 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ What did you think?
L123127 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ You designed Gotham Plaza?  The big silver guys pulling on those big silver things...
L123058 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ I'm not afraid. Are you?
L123057 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
L123056 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
L123055 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan.
L123054 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ How heroic of you...
L123053 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...Would you like to go to dinner? I know; a tame suggestion considering the wide variety of miniature golf possibilities available to the Oasisburg citizen--but nevertheless, would you?
L123052 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ You're probably right.
L123051 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
L123050 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
L123049 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ What's the matter...
L123046 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ I wonder..
L123045 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ Strange--you seemed so close. I wonder what's happened since yesterday..
L122922 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ I don't know. I can't remember.
L122921 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
L122920 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Guilty. I am.
L122919 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ You say that like an amnesia victim.
L122918 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
L122917 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
L122916 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ In women?
L122915 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ He likes you. Kincaid and I have always had similar tastes...
L123485 +++$+++ u4383 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ LANE +++$+++ What little boy doesn't?
L123484 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
L123483 +++$+++ u4383 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ LANE +++$+++ But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
L123482 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
L123481 +++$+++ u4383 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ LANE +++$+++ I've been looking for you.
L123430 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ It may be time to get the police involved...
L123429 +++$+++ u4383 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ LANE +++$+++ I can. That's not an admission of guilt,  It's just..I knew you had it in you...
L123426 +++$+++ u4383 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ LANE +++$+++ Did you ever think that maybe neither of us is Captain God?
L123425 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
L123424 +++$+++ u4383 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ LANE +++$+++ We're waiting.
L123420 +++$+++ u4383 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ LANE +++$+++ Your uniform, that first time I saw you, was a ghastly cage I vowed to unlock in order to..
L123419 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ You're right, I wasn't looking to fall in love with a casino worker. I'd given up trying to find anyone. But there was a fire in your eyes that cut right through the air conditioning and through the coldness of my heart.
L123415 +++$+++ u4383 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ LANE +++$+++ But it's true!  You can call him yourself.
L123414 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ You're kidding.
L123405 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
L123404 +++$+++ u4383 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ LANE +++$+++ Selina, are you okay?
L123365 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ Oh, you don't have to explain to me where you're going...
L123364 +++$+++ u4383 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ LANE +++$+++ I better go report this in...
L123363 +++$+++ u4383 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ LANE +++$+++ I suppose she does.
L123362 +++$+++ u4376 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
L123361 +++$+++ u4383 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ LANE +++$+++ A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
