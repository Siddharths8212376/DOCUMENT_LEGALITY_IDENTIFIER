L411268 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
L411267 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
L411266 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ What's that?
L411249 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
L411248 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
L411247 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
L411246 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ What is with this school and prom?
L411213 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ NASA.  Plus we have these really fun pizza study groups, and we go to-these all county meets. And, I mean, not that you need it, and without sounding too much like the Godfather, I think we could offer you a certain amount of protection", if you know what I mean. We all kind of stick together and watch out for each other.
L411212 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ College?
L411211 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
L411210 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Petty good.
L411209 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
L411208 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ Sure. No problem.
L411207 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Thanks.
L411206 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.
L411194 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.
L411193 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
L411191 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
L411190 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
L411189 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Oh I know.
L411188 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
L411187 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Yeah. Let's do that.
L411186 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ : Because he's Guy Perkins.  Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?
L411185 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Why do they listen to Guy?
L411184 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
L411183 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ How long will they watch us for?
L411182 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ Nice.
L411181 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
L411180 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ Well, do you?
L411179 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ What?
L411176 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now-
L411175 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Never mind.  That is so awful that they hide your cars.
L411174 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
L411173 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
L411172 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
L411171 +++$+++ u6854 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ALDYS +++$+++ Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.
L411370 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Nope.
L411369 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ No Roger from op/ed?
L411368 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
L411367 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night.
L411366 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ You should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you.
L411365 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
L411364 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
L411363 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Leave.
L411362 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Gus, have you ever been in love?
L411040 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ YOU KNIT?
L411039 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ YOU DID.
L410934 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
L410933 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Oh, man! Who told?
L411549 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What about the "Roaring Twenties"… or "The 80's"?
L411548 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Well excuse me.
L411547 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
L411546 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
L411525 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Right. Right.
L411524 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
L411523 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox!  Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal.  Oh look. Class is over already.
L411518 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ If you say so.
L411517 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You're Pam?
L411516 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
L411515 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hi. You're here for the sex talk?
L411820 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.
L411819 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Wow. It's packed.
L411783 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
L411782 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ You need my help?
L411781 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
L411780 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?
L411522 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ 
L411521 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Hi!
L411084 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Jos, please try and have some fun here, okay? How many of us get to go back to high school? You're gonna have a blast!
L411083 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Anita!
L411082 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
L411081 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ 'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
L411080 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Cuuuute!
L411079 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.
L411078 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ How about this?
L411077 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Very romantic.
L411076 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Bridgework?
L411075 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ What'd you feel when you kissed him?
L411074 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.
L411073 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ That is lingerie.
L411072 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Now this is cute.
L411071 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Mama mia.  Just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation.
L411070 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
L411069 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Okay. That's bad.
L411068 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
L411067 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
L411066 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Anita, remember espadrilles?
L411065 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ So, you were a geek. Big deal.
L411038 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
L411037 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Senorita Josie.
L411036 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs?
L411035 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Jos, that's not what we're --
L411034 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.
L411030 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!
L411029 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ You don't think I can do it.
L411028 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
L411027 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller".
L410975 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
L410974 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
L410973 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ When I finally get kissed, I'll know.
L410972 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
L410971 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
L410970 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy—  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
L410969 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Anita!
L410968 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
L410967 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I'm concentrating on my career right now.
L410966 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
L410965 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Forget it.
L410957 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ You stood for like a month.
L410956 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L410955 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
L410936 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
L410935 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
L410927 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure.
L410926 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
L410925 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Who told!
L410924 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Roger in Op/Ed.
L410923 +++$+++ u6855 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Guess who I did it with last night...
L411338 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus.
L411337 +++$+++ u6856 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
L411336 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Wings?
L411335 +++$+++ u6856 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Hidden camera.
L411334 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ What is this?
L411333 +++$+++ u6856 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Just get in the van, Josie.
L411332 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ George! What are you doing here?
L411705 +++$+++ u6862 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen?  Did I say that out loud?
L411704 +++$+++ u6857 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GIBBY +++$+++ You guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?
L411672 +++$+++ u6862 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.
L411671 +++$+++ u6857 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GIBBY +++$+++ Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea.
L411566 +++$+++ u6862 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Her dad sold a car to Leonardo Di Caprio's uncle and before he picked it up, her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures.
L411565 +++$+++ u6857 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GIBBY +++$+++ Wannabes. Kirsten transitioned last year.
L411531 +++$+++ u6857 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GIBBY +++$+++ Sometimes opposites attract.
L411530 +++$+++ u6862 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ wait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different.
L411507 +++$+++ u6862 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
L411506 +++$+++ u6857 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GIBBY +++$+++ Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?
L411679 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Rosalind and Orlando.  From "As You Like It"?  Shakespeare?
L411678 +++$+++ u6857 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GIBBY +++$+++ Don't tell me... You're Medieval Barbie.
L411624 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Betty.
L411623 +++$+++ u6857 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GIBBY +++$+++ Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica?
L411581 +++$+++ u6857 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GIBBY +++$+++ By Guy?
L411580 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Do I want to be crunched?
L411579 +++$+++ u6857 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GIBBY +++$+++ He is totally crunching on you.
L411568 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Why?
L411567 +++$+++ u6857 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GIBBY +++$+++ : Wait. Do you know any gay guys?
L411562 +++$+++ u6857 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GIBBY +++$+++ You crossed over.
L411561 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Transitioned?
L411560 +++$+++ u6857 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GIBBY +++$+++ Josie, you have totally transitioned.
L411513 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.
L411512 +++$+++ u6857 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GIBBY +++$+++ I think it's pronounced gauche.
L411152 +++$+++ u6857 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GIBBY +++$+++ Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
L411151 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
L411778 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ I'll tell you a story. It's about this shy copy editor who makes a mockery of herself and her boss when she completely botches her first assignment as a reporter.
L411777 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
L411776 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us.
L411660 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ You already pitched this to Rigfort?!
L411659 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
L411658 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
L411657 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!
L411656 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ He's my teacher!
L411655 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
L411654 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
L411653 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ That's your story!
L411343 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
L411342 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ What if I say no?
L411341 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
L411340 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Gus?
L411303 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ OUT!
L411302 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
L411301 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.
L411300 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ They hid my car--
L411299 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Do you even know these kids?
L411298 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this.
L411297 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ This is where the stories are. You are going to become friends with these people. You are going to party with them. You are going to hang out with them on weekends. When they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo!
L411296 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Well, how would you define to parties"? Because we ordered a deli platter at this one Denominator drill session--
L411295 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Have you been to any parties?
L411294 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Uhh, no.
L411293 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Have you been there?
L411292 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go.
L411291 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Kristen got a quote?
L411290 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call "The Court." Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, "Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night."
L411289 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Oh. Right.
L411288 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
L411203 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!
L411202 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
L411201 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
L411200 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ It's an expose on cafeteria food.
L411199 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ You're a sick puppy, Geller.
L411198 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ It's my dad. He worries.  Hi, Dad. I miss you too.
L411033 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Geller, this is way out of your league.
L411032 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ But I don't want it straightened out.
L411031 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
L410952 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Hey--I can be out of control.
L410951 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
L410950 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
L410949 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
L410948 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ A--flack jacket.
L410947 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ A flack jacket.
L410946 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
L410945 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
L410944 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ You've done five of my ideas.
