L339506 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.
L339505 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
L339504 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ The new store?
L339503 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ What?
L339502 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Ellen?
L339477 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas, because you'd be worried about how much money we don't have to spend on each other... I know it's not New Years, because you'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don't like to dance... and I'm sure it's not our anniversary, because I didn't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says, 'Pick out something pretty'... Yes -- Maurice -- I'm virtually certain it's not a special day today.
L339476 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ It's a special day isn't it?
L339474 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ It's just a regular day.
L339473 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?
L339472 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ There was no card.
L339471 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ You thought I sent them?
L339469 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ The flowers... they're beautiful.
L339468 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Yes?
L339905 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ I'm not proving to her.  I'm showing her.  And I know I don't have to.  I want to.  I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can.
L339904 +++$+++ u1742 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ You don't have to prove anything to her.
L339903 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ About my love for her.
L339902 +++$+++ u1742 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Doubts?  About what?
L339901 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
L339900 +++$+++ u1742 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ That's a reasonable assumption.
L339899 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
L339898 +++$+++ u1742 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Most certainly.
L339897 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
L339896 +++$+++ u1742 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Why?
L339895 +++$+++ u1742 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ I see.
L339894 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
L339893 +++$+++ u1742 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ From where?
L339892 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Pacifica, California.
L339891 +++$+++ u1742 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ To where?
L339888 +++$+++ u1742 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now.
L339887 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.
L339886 +++$+++ u1742 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.
L339885 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ What did they ask?
L339884 +++$+++ u1754 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ TANDY +++$+++ Out of the car.  He jumped out of the god damn car!
L339883 +++$+++ u1744 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ HANSEN +++$+++ Jumped where?
L339882 +++$+++ u1754 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ TANDY +++$+++ Shit!  He jumped!
L339879 +++$+++ u1754 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ TANDY +++$+++ That's all right isn't it?
L339878 +++$+++ u1744 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ HANSEN +++$+++ I'm going to drop off Tandy at the station and then drop you back.
L339856 +++$+++ u1744 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ HANSEN +++$+++ P-A-R-K-E-R.  Right.  Get on the horn with Philly.  Call me here.
L339855 +++$+++ u1754 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ TANDY +++$+++ Hansen's whipped.  Has to call his wife every two hours or she'll go ballistic when he gets home.
L339854 +++$+++ u1754 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ TANDY +++$+++ Maurice and Ellen Parker... it was issued in Philly... Mr. Maurice Parker has come a long way from home.  Why?
L339853 +++$+++ u1744 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ HANSEN +++$+++ A marriage certificate?  Who the hell carries their marriage certificate around?
L339850 +++$+++ u1744 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ HANSEN +++$+++ If he is, half the town has seen us take him out for dinner like a couple of jack-asses.
L339849 +++$+++ u1754 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ TANDY +++$+++ This guy's not a murderer.
L339848 +++$+++ u1744 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ HANSEN +++$+++ It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.
L339847 +++$+++ u1754 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ TANDY +++$+++ Not our problem.
L339846 +++$+++ u1744 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ HANSEN +++$+++ Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
L339845 +++$+++ u1754 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ TANDY +++$+++ Not our problem.
L339844 +++$+++ u1744 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ HANSEN +++$+++ Red flags man.
L339833 +++$+++ u1754 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ TANDY +++$+++ If he's in trouble with the law -- fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.
L339832 +++$+++ u1744 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ HANSEN +++$+++ Red flag, man.
L339831 +++$+++ u1754 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ TANDY +++$+++ His name is Maurice.  He's dancing around everything else.
L339830 +++$+++ u1744 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ HANSEN +++$+++ What's his story?
L339945 +++$+++ u1745 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ISAAC +++$+++ You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again.
L339944 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
L339943 +++$+++ u1745 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ISAAC +++$+++ Nine.
L339942 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
L339941 +++$+++ u1745 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ISAAC +++$+++ That's me.
L339940 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands.  'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove.
L339938 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Who's telling this story?
L339937 +++$+++ u1745 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ISAAC +++$+++ You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
L339936 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.
L339932 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Oh no... I'm not good at that. Very bad in fact...
L339931 +++$+++ u1745 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ISAAC +++$+++ You tell stories?
L339930 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Your parents would want you to be in bed.
L339929 +++$+++ u1745 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ISAAC +++$+++ You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up.
L339928 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ I thought you were asleep.
L339918 +++$+++ u1745 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ISAAC +++$+++ Yeah!
L339917 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
L339916 +++$+++ u1745 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ISAAC +++$+++ You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
L339915 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Is that right?
L339914 +++$+++ u1745 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ISAAC +++$+++ You know what, I can play baseball with my brothers when I'm bigger.
L339913 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ I'm Maurice Parker... I'm much older than three.  Are your parents home?
L339912 +++$+++ u1745 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ISAAC +++$+++ I'm Isaac... I'm three.
L339911 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Well, hello.
L339608 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ By car right?
L339607 +++$+++ u1746 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ JOSELLE +++$+++ Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
L339606 +++$+++ u1746 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ JOSELLE +++$+++ This is the route approved by triple A.  Even if you followed back roads the entire way, you'd still be looking at roughly the same distance...
L339605 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Perhaps there's another route?
L339604 +++$+++ u1746 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ JOSELLE +++$+++ What was that?
L339603 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Three thousand miles?... How many times does twenty go into three thousand?
L339602 +++$+++ u1746 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ JOSELLE +++$+++ Damn baby, relax.  I'm getting to it.  From Philadelphia following the route highlighted to Pacifica California -- you're traveling an estimated three thousand two hundred miles...
L339601 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Making the grand total?
L339600 +++$+++ u1746 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ JOSELLE +++$+++ Each inch represents 150 miles...
L339977 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ Maybe.
L339976 +++$+++ u1749 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ Umm, he's going to make it isn't he?
L339973 +++$+++ u1749 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ Umm, Coalville Utah.
L339972 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ Michelle, breathe... that's it, what is it, talk to me.
L339872 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ God damn, you're right... You don't say much Michelle, but what you say is golden.
L339871 +++$+++ u1749 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ Umm, no.  It's just that --
L339870 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ What are you saying?  This story is too big for this paper?
L339869 +++$+++ u1749 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ The Gazette's small huh?
L339868 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ Mammoth.
L339867 +++$+++ u1749 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ This story is big huh?
L340069 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ No more words.  Until I touch the ocean with my hands... it's all just words.
L340068 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ She knows you love her Mr. Parker. She knows now.
L340066 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ It's mine to risk.
L340065 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life.
L340064 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ ... To look me in the eye and say what's important to you isn't as important to me?  To tell me you know what's best?  To tell me life is more precious than what I feel for my wife?
L340063 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ Don't do this.
L340062 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
L340061 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ I do.
L340060 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing.
L340059 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ I can't do it.  I want you to finish, but I want you to live more.
L340058 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ What, come on?
L340057 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ Come on Mr. Parker.
L340056 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ Saluting.
L340055 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Are they standing?
L340053 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ I was thinking you could open another store with investors.  I'm sure a lot of people would want to get involved with you now.
L340052 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ I haven't been too punctual with the rent.
L340050 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ You were right.  From the heart is always better.
L340049 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Adelle told me, your writing is going well.  The Crusader for social issues and all.
L340048 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ I missed you to Mr. Parker.
L340047 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ I missed you Kris.
L340046 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ You're amazing.
L340045 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ ... The Grapes of Wrath.
L340044 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ Tom Joad?
L339677 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ She never ate a slice.
L339676 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ What Mr. Parker?
L339675 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast... Everyday. Now that's about a quarter mile each way... 17 years... that comes to about three thousand miles...  And you know what Kris?
L339673 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ So I've been informed.
L339672 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.
L339671 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Because I should have shown her before... Everyday, I should have shown her.
L339670 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ Why know?
L339669 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ I need to show her how much I love her Kris.
L339668 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.
L339667 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ I'm really lost.  What does this have to do with walking?
L339666 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ She wasn't certain... I never really showed her.
L339665 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ She knew you loved her.
L339664 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.
L339663 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ Oh, a coastal city.  That's good.
L339662 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
L339661 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ You're walking to California?
L339660 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ I told you.
L339659 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
L339658 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ ... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
L339657 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ Phileas Fogg?
L339632 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ I always knew you had good instincts...  Goodbye Kris.  I'll see you when I get back.
L339631 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ The hairs on my arm are standing up... Something strange is happening.
L339630 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ California.
L339629 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ Walking where?
L339628 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ I'm walking there Kris.
L339627 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Tomorrow.
L339626 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ When are you leaving?
L339623 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ California.
L339622 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ Where?
L339621 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Yes.
L339620 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ You going on a trip Mr. Parker?
L339619 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ No.  No... I won't be here for a while.  The store will be closed in the interim.
L339618 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ Are you firing me?
L339614 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great.
L339613 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
L339612 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things.  How can you feel for dog food?  The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.
L339611 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ I want to reach people.  Nobody listens to me.  This is my way to reach them.
L339493 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.
L339492 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ What happened?
L339491 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ Pulitzer, here I come.
L339490 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
L339489 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ They called her 'Lizy' in the book...  Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on the way over from the paper.
L339488 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ It has to be a full character's name.
L339487 +++$+++ u1747 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ KRIS +++$+++ You're amazing.
L339486 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Lizy, Eliza... Elizabeth Bennett...  Pride and Prejudice.
L340091 +++$+++ u1753 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Someone should be with you.
L340090 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.
L340082 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Did you tell him everything you wanted to?  Did you do everything you could while he was here?
L340081 +++$+++ u1753 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ ... My father.
L340080 +++$+++ u1753 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Mr. Parker, I'm supposed to give you your fish sticks.
L340079 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
L340078 +++$+++ u1753 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did.
L340077 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ I need your help.
L340076 +++$+++ u1753 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ You're in pain.
L340074 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Do you have a car, Steph?
L340073 +++$+++ u1753 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Steph.
L340072 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ What do your friends call you?
L340002 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Which hospital?  Did you take me back?
L340001 +++$+++ u1753 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ In a hospital.
