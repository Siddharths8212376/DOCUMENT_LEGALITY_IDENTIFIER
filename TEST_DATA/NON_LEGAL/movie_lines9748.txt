L164555 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ Good evening, Neighbor Stone.
L164307 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ 1840. Well, that'll take us to the seventh day of April in 1847.
L164306 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ The seventh day of April --
L164305 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
L164304 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Well, I'll be -- 
L164303 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ Excellent. A firm, fair signature. One that will last till doomsday.  My dear Neighbor Stone, I congratulate you! You're going to be the richest man in New Hampshire! 
L164301 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?
L164300 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ No, no! Give it to me!
L164299 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ Well, why should that worry you. A soul -- a soul is nothing. Can you see it, smell it, touch it? -- No! -- Think of it -- this soul -- your soul -- a nothing, against seven whole years of good luck! You will have money and all that money can buy. Upon my word, Neighbor Stone, if it weren't for my firm's reputation for generous dealing--
L164298 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ What does it mean here -- about my soul?
L164297 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
L164296 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ It's mine?
L164295 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.
L164294 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Yes, why shouldn't it?
L164293 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ Oh, you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!
L164292 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Where did it come from?
L164279 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ A clever man like yourself -- he can find money anywhere. Money to pay his bills -- money for his wife and his children -- money to be a rich man. All he needs is a friend to point it out to him.  Like that!
L164278 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
L164277 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
L164276 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Opportunities?
L164275 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
L164274 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
L164273 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ Do you deny that you called me? I've known people in other States who went back on their word. But I didn't expect it in New Hampshire.
L165029 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Breakfast ... Ah! ... Come along friends, Ma Stone's a cook this side of heaven.
L165028 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Ma says breakfast's ready, Mr. Webster!
L165022 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ I know -- that was mighty queer Medford -- knew it the minute I tasted it. But it takes more than that to down Daniel Webster.
L165021 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Well, I --
L165020 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
L164937 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Oh, come, man, come. Just because you've sold your soul to the devil that needn't make you a teetotaler.
L164936 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ There's no joy in it for me.
L164935 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ There's nothing like it. I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. Come -- try a nip!
L164933 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Then I'll just christen the jug, with your permission, Stone. Somehow or other, waiting's wonderfully shorter with a jug.
L164932 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Not long -- now.
L164931 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ They make plucky women in New England.  H'm ... how long have we to wait?
L164924 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Yes -- at midnight.
L164923 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
L164922 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
L164921 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ It's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
L164880 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ It's your fault! You brought Daniel Webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- I don't want to -- to talk to you again!
L164879 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
L164878 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
L164877 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ I'm sorry you can't see that, I know you could once -- you made a little speech once, that I'll always remember and I know the others do too --  They remember and they see how you have changed. That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you, Jabez -- you're as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you, it's not the money, I've been talking about, it's what you make of it.
L164876 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ They'd have a good neighbor, Jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more!
L164875 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
L164874 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
L164873 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ What -- what's on your mind?
L164872 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?
L164871 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Well -- Mr. Webster! This is a great day for me. Come on in, sir. I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!
L164428 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Well -- I'll be -- if it isn't little Mary Sampson from Franklin.
L164427 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
L164426 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Eloquent speech, Neighbor Stone -- couldn't have done better myself --  -- under the circumstances.  Thank you.
L164405 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Thanks, Mr. Webster!  To the champion of the whole United States -- Dan'l Webster!
L164404 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Here's a man who knows what's good for Dan'l Webster! Medford rum! Ah, a breath of the Promised Land!  To the champion of the Iron Horseshoe, Jabez Stone!
L164397 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Not at all, lad -- not at all.  For a good game of horseshoes I would always sacrifice fame and acclaim.
L164396 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
L164395 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.
L164394 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Webster.
L164393 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?
L164392 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Ten throws it is.
L164391 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
L164775 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Shake!
L164774 +++$+++ u4835 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SQUIRE +++$+++ 5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
L164773 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ How much?
L164772 +++$+++ u4835 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SQUIRE +++$+++ Why not -- ?
L164771 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
L164770 +++$+++ u4835 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SQUIRE +++$+++ You are not so sure that he'll come.
L164769 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.
L164768 +++$+++ u4835 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SQUIRE +++$+++ Well -- yes --
L164767 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
L164766 +++$+++ u4835 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SQUIRE +++$+++ You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
L164765 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Yes  siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: "Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor." Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.
L164764 +++$+++ u4835 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SQUIRE +++$+++ You want me to go around --
L164763 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ You keep that -- that's for you. I want you to talk up the party to make sure that the best folks really come.
L164762 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ You think that's a joke? I had him on there too, but I was afraid Dan'l Webster might feel insulted.
L164761 +++$+++ u4835 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SQUIRE +++$+++ The only one you missed -- is the President.
L164760 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
L164759 +++$+++ u4835 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SQUIRE +++$+++ Yes.
L164758 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
L164757 +++$+++ u4835 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SQUIRE +++$+++ Dan'l Webster?
L164756 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
L164755 +++$+++ u4835 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SQUIRE +++$+++ Why of course --
L164754 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
L164753 +++$+++ u4835 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SQUIRE +++$+++ Well, Jabez -- I'm a little pressed for time. You wanted to discuss something -- some business --
L164749 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ You really think so?
L164748 +++$+++ u4835 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SQUIRE +++$+++ How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez?  Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
L164747 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Howdy, Squire! Howdy! Oh -- how do you do, Squire.
L164488 +++$+++ u4835 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SQUIRE +++$+++ Well? Don't a politician have to be?
L164487 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ But -- I was just lucky.
L164484 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Selectman? Selectman of the village? Me?
L164483 +++$+++ u4835 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SQUIRE +++$+++ And so, Jabez Stone, in the name of the Whig Party of Cross Corners, we offer you the nomination of that party for Selectman.
L164477 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Camomile tea!
L164476 +++$+++ u4835 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SQUIRE +++$+++ Worst I had in years -- ahem -- starting a spring cold, I guess -- er -- don't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house, do you, Stone?
L164475 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Headache -- Squire?
L164474 +++$+++ u4835 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SQUIRE +++$+++ Oh!
L164473 +++$+++ u4835 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SQUIRE +++$+++ Ahem -- Neighbor Stone, we want--
L164472 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Mighty good of you to come out, Squire -- sparing all this time to --  Sheriff, too -- and Schoolmaster -- mighty nice.
L164469 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Come right into the parlor, won't you, folks.
L164468 +++$+++ u4835 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SQUIRE +++$+++ Ahem -- we want to have a little confidential talk with you, Neighbor Stone. Don't like to take a man away from his planting -- but sometimes --
L164465 +++$+++ u4835 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SQUIRE +++$+++ Morning, Jabez.
L164464 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Why -- good morning, Squire.
L164434 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Shall we?
L164433 +++$+++ u4835 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SQUIRE +++$+++ Coming along, Jabez?
L165019 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Mary!
L165018 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Jabez -- Jabez!
L164930 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ All right, Jabez ...
L164929 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ You must go now, Mary -- you must!
L164919 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
L164918 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Mary! Come back ...
L164917 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Jabez!
L164916 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!
L164821 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ What's the matter with 'em? Why don't they come?
L164820 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
L164819 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Think this room is larger than anything Webster's got at Marshfield? You've been there. What about it, Mary?
L164817 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I don't know, Jabez.
L164816 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Why don't they come --
L164705 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Oh, for heaven's sake, leave me alone!
L164704 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?
L164703 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ It shows on your face.
L164702 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ But Jabez, I never said that!
L164701 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ He's my son and I like him the way he is. Why do you always have to pick on him? If it's not the boy it's me. You don't like the way I live -- you don't like my friends, or my new house -- or anything.
L164700 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.
L164699 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Isn't that your own fault?
L164698 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.
L164693 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ You're not supposed to punish my son, Mary.
L164692 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I am going to lock him up.
L164691 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ What happened.... Where are you taking him?
L164637 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Nothing, Jabez -- just natural for a baby to cry, sometimes.  Shh, little Daniel -- sleep -- sleep --
L164636 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
L164635 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun, Sleep, sleep, my baby -- Raccoon sits in the spruce all night, Sleep, baby, sleep --
L164602 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Don't be cross with him, Ma. This don't happen every day.
L164601 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Well -- I -- I-
L164596 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Hello, Jabez --  Here's your son.
L164595 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Mary --
L164571 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
L164570 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 
L164518 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now, I've made up my mind.
L164517 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Jabez -- once you said we'd never change --
L164514 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ And I don't want to have a washwoman for a wife.
L164513 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No, no. I don't want to be idle.
L164512 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
L164511 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
L164510 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
L164509 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It's very becoming to you, Mr. Selectman.
L164508 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ I'm serious.
L164507 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Selectman!
L164506 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
L164505 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'll never get my washing done.
L164504 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ You could have knocked me down with a feather -- Selectman -- me.
L164494 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Oh -- Jabez.
L164493 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!
L164480 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Thanks, Mary.
L164479 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'll get it, Jabez.
L164478 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Mary, get three cups of camomile tea for the Squire and the rest. They all feel colds coming on.
L164462 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Jabez --
L164461 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Mary --
L164460 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Don't take cold, Jabez.  Come -- it's warm in here.
L164459 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
L164458 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
L164454 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.
L164453 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You'll never change -- will you?
L164452 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ There is nothing to worry about now.
L164451 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Worried!
L164450 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Tired?
L164449 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ But I'm glad to be home again --
L164448 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Oh, Jabez -- it was a wonderful day --
L164447 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Remember, Mary, how he said it: "Couldn't have done better myself, Jabez Stone," and it was my first speech. I don't know what came into me, Mary. I just stood up and the words came flowing like water out of my mouth.
L164436 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
L164435 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ We must go on home, Jabez.
L164358 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Looks right elegant, Mary.
L164357 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What do you think of that, Jabez?
L164327 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'd love to.
L164326 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
L164325 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It feels fine now, Jabez.
L164315 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Mary -- look! Hessian gold. I found it in the barn.
L164314 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
L164313 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Mary -- what would you do?
L164312 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Jabez!
L164311 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
L164267 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.
L164266 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ I'll get the doctor.
L164263 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Mary -- how do you feel?
L164262 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Jabez ...
L164261 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Mary--
L164250 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ You're right, Mary it's a fine calf. That's why Stevens'll take it for the rest of the payment.
L164249 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ...  It's a lovely calf.
L164248 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
L164247 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Jabez!
L164237 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ I will, Mary -- always thought a man could be stronger alone -- seems I've been wrong about that.
L164236 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
L164235 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end?
L164234 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
L164233 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ To save us work on the spring plowing?
L164232 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
L164231 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.
L164230 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
L164229 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
L164228 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Not all of it?
L164227 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Mary -- it's gone.
L164226 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Do you think I'm grudging it?
L164225 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Your butter money?
