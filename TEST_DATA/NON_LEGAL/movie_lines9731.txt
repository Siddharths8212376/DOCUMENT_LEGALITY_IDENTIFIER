L150554 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ We'll see that she gets there in good time
L150553 +++$+++ u4724 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MISS CALLAHAN +++$+++ You'd better hurry.  I've left Amy in the car and she's getting impatient.  She tells me there's something especially important about a sixth birthday.
L150529 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Amy has too many fancies -- too few friends. It worries me. It doesn't seem normal.
L150528 +++$+++ u4724 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MISS CALLAHAN +++$+++ Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
L150527 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.
L150526 +++$+++ u4724 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MISS CALLAHAN +++$+++ Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
L150525 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ I know it may seem stupid of me--but it isn't the slap I'm worried about -- it's the reason.
L151598 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ Looks like a helluva lot more than a make-over. Was there surgery involved?
L151597 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Jennifer gave her a make-over.
L151596 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.
L151585 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Can we get some service here?
L151584 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ Waiter! She needs more water.
L151192 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome.
L151191 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
L151190 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
L151189 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
L151188 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.
L151187 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
L151186 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
L151185 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It all starts with them going to the bathroom together.
L151613 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Never felt better.
L151612 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
L151611 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I've been working out.
L151610 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ Wow your body's really hot.
L151609 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ Your lips look delicious.
L151608 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What?
L151606 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ Yeah but they looked cool...
L151605 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
L151604 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
L151603 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No.
L151602 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
L151601 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.
L151600 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I've changed a lot lately.
L151599 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.
L151577 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ Yeah that's like a three bagger. Today a bag is also a condom, so now a three bagger can be a chick that's really hot. So hot you gotta put several condoms on to dull the senses.
L151576 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.
L151575 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ No one I've run into knows what "coyote ugly" means.
L151573 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ Don't apologize. It's great to see a woman really enjoying her food. I hate it when I buy a woman dinner and she won't even touch it.
L151572 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
L151571 +++$+++ u4727 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ CARLTON +++$+++ Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?
L151471 +++$+++ u4728 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Now it's menopause. She's always hot. I gotta wear a parka around the house cause she keeps it so cold. It's always something.
L151470 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Does she have PMS?
L151469 +++$+++ u4728 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
L151468 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I get crazy dreams and I black out.
L151467 +++$+++ u4728 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
L151466 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
L151465 +++$+++ u4728 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ How have you been feeling?
L151464 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Nearly four.
L151463 +++$+++ u4728 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?
L151264 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ It's not just in my head.
L151263 +++$+++ u4728 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
L151262 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What else is there?
L151261 +++$+++ u4728 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
L151260 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
L151259 +++$+++ u4728 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
L151258 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Good. Except for PMS.
L151257 +++$+++ u4728 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ How's the rest of your health?
L151255 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No, it was another woman.
L151254 +++$+++ u4728 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ A dog at Victoria's Secret?
L151253 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Oh, on my wrist.
L151252 +++$+++ u4728 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ I mean where on your body?
L151251 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ There was a sale.
L151250 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ At Victoria's Secret.
L151249 +++$+++ u4728 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
L151643 +++$+++ u4735 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ It's okay if you are, we just want to know. I don't want to be expecting grandchildren if...
L151642 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
L151641 +++$+++ u4735 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
L151640 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What does that have to do with me?
L151639 +++$+++ u4735 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ We're worried about you. "60 Minutes" was on same-sex couples.
L151638 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Mom!
L151637 +++$+++ u4735 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ No it's mom.
L151636 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Jennifer?
L152038 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Sure. See ya.
L152037 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
L152036 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
L152035 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.
L152034 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Frida? You okay?
L152033 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Hello?
L151977 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. Then the PMS should be over.
L151976 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
L151975 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I wish I only had your problems.
L151974 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
L151973 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I thought you and George were getting married.
L151972 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ No, he's the guy I'm having an affair with.
L151971 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Did I kill a guy named Benito?
L151970 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ About Benito.
L151969 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ About Mark? Carlton?
L151968 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I think George knows.
L151967 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ The werewolf always dies at the end. Didn't you see "American Werewolf in London?"
L151966 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ No. I won't let you do that.
L151965 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
L151964 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I guess you'll find out.
L151963 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
L151962 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
L151961 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
L151960 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks.
L151959 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean.
L151958 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
L151957 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I'm cleaning my stove.
L151939 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I think I already have.
L151938 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Fall in love.
L151937 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ So what do I do?
L151936 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ What choice do we have?
L151935 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
L151934 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
L151933 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Guess she never found true love.
L151932 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ She died at age 34 in the 1800's. They thought she was crazy. She was banished from her town. Seems her husband shot her.
L151931 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
L151930 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ "The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
L151929 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
L151928 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. "The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love."
L151926 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Check out what I found.
L151925 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ "Paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in vision, feelings of losing control; belief that you have a mental problem..." Nothing about turning into a werewolf.
L151895 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ We don't know you're a werewolf. It might never happen again. You have to get on with your life.
L151894 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
L151893 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
L151892 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Peter keeps asking me out.
L151891 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
L151868 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ So are you. Look, go about your life. Act like nothing's wrong. We'll get to the bottom of this.
L151867 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You're such a good friend.
L151866 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
L151865 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.
L151864 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Does that mean this whole thing is over?
L151863 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I think I just got my period.
L151856 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
L151855 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Peter knows something.
L151809 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Hide him.
L151808 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What the fuck are we going to do?
L151804 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Tell them you'll meet them outside.
L151803 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me, now I have to let him in.
L151802 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Ignore it.
L151801 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No.
L151800 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You expecting someone?
L151799 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You should have seen it erect.
L151798 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark.
L151791 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Okay, let's say that this is PMS- related. You think those male cops are going to understand that? You'll either be locked up for murder or locked up in the looney bin. We have to keep this hidden until we figure it out ourselves.
L151790 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
L151789 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
L151788 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I could smell another woman on him.
L151787 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Why the fuck would you do that?
L151786 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
L151785 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
L151784 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
L151783 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
L151782 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
L151781 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
L151780 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What? Why'd you do that?
L151779 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
L151778 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Why not? There's been a murder.
L151777 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ DON'T call the police.
L151776 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
L151775 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ What happened to his tooth?
L151768 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Yeah, I guess. Mark?
L151767 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ He's been here all night?
L151766 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.
L151765 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Did you get rid of Mark?
L151764 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Holy shit, I don't know.
L151744 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I'm stopping by later. I'm worried about you. Bye.
L151743 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Okay, I gotta go.
L151742 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Get rid of him!
L151738 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No way could you have done that. Maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out... or...
L151737 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
L151736 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ And he was missing an arm.
L151735 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Oh no.
L151734 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Frida, Carlton's dead.
L151733 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Shit, I guess I missed work.
L151732 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Tuesday. Are you okay?
L151731 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I've been here. What day is it?
L151730 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been?
L151729 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Hello?
L151670 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.
L151669 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
L151668 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I haven't gotten it yet.
L151667 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
L151666 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
L151665 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
L151664 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No, last night I think I chased Carlton around as a wolf and killed him. I woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed. And my throat hurts.
L151663 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida, are you on drugs?
L151662 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf!
L151661 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ And what makes you think you killed a man?
L151660 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I put it down the garbage disposal.
L151659 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ So where's this infamous arm now?
L151634 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Frida, you're not making sense. I can't come over right now.
L151633 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter?
L151632 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No! Not fucked him, I think I killed him.
L151631 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
L151630 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.
L151628 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ There is a man's arm in my bed.
L151627 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone.
L151595 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I look like fuckin' Chewbacca.
L151594 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
L151593 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
L151592 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ No they're not.
L151591 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!
L151590 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No you don't, believe me.
L151589 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
L151588 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
L151587 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You might want to tape your nipples down next time. It's really distracting.
L151581 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I still thought it was a purse.
L151580 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault."
