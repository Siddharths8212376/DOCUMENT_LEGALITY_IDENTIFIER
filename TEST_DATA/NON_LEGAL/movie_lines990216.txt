L451802 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
L451800 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.  I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.
L451799 +++$+++ u7145 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ FEZZIK +++$+++ I don't think more than ten.
L451798 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ How many could you handle?
L451797 +++$+++ u7145 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ FEZZIK +++$+++ He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
L451793 +++$+++ u7145 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ FEZZIK +++$+++ Yeah?
L451792 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ Perhaps not. I feel fine.
L451791 +++$+++ u7145 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ FEZZIK +++$+++ You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either.
L451790 +++$+++ u7145 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ FEZZIK +++$+++ True!
L451789 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ It's you.
L451788 +++$+++ u7145 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ FEZZIK +++$+++ Hello.
L451395 +++$+++ u7145 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ FEZZIK +++$+++ If there are, we'll all be dead.
L451394 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?
L451392 +++$+++ u7145 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ FEZZIK +++$+++ Yes, some of the time. 
L451391 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
L451390 +++$+++ u7145 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ FEZZIK +++$+++ He's really very short on charm.
L451389 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ Probably he means no harm.
L452098 +++$+++ u7146 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ As you wish...
L452097 +++$+++ u7153 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
L452095 +++$+++ u7146 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So long. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          124.
L452094 +++$+++ u7153 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ Okay.
L452093 +++$+++ u7146 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
L452090 +++$+++ u7153 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ I don't mind so much.
L452089 +++$+++ u7146 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
L452088 +++$+++ u7153 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ What? What?
L451856 +++$+++ u7146 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Okay.  All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.
L451855 +++$+++ u7153 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ No! I'm okay. I'm okay.  -- sit down. All right?
L451852 +++$+++ u7146 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.
L451851 +++$+++ u7153 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?
L451850 +++$+++ u7146 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ I don't understand.
L451849 +++$+++ u7153 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ Who gets Humperdinck?
L451848 +++$+++ u7146 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ You want me to read this or not?
L451847 +++$+++ u7153 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ Westley's only faking, right?
L451743 +++$+++ u7146 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ -- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.
L451742 +++$+++ u7153 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
L451741 +++$+++ u7146 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ It was ten days till the wedding. The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse.
L451734 +++$+++ u7146 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
L451733 +++$+++ u7153 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ Yes.
L451732 +++$+++ u7146 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Do you want me to go on with this?
L451731 +++$+++ u7153 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
L451730 +++$+++ u7146 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
L451729 +++$+++ u7153 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
L451660 +++$+++ u7146 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.  So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor.
L451659 +++$+++ u7153 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
L451658 +++$+++ u7146 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Someday, you may not mind so much.
L451657 +++$+++ u7153 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part?
L451656 +++$+++ u7146 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ What is it? What's the matter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.
L451655 +++$+++ u7153 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ Oh no. No, please.
L451422 +++$+++ u7153 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ No. You could read a little bit more ... if you want. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           17.
L451421 +++$+++ u7146 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Because I can stop now if you want.
L451420 +++$+++ u7153 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.
L451419 +++$+++ u7153 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ Well, I wasn't nervous.
L451418 +++$+++ u7146 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
L451417 +++$+++ u7153 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ What?
L451360 +++$+++ u7153 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ -- murdered by pirates is good --
L451359 +++$+++ u7146 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
L451352 +++$+++ u7153 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ I don't be-leeve this.
L451351 +++$+++ u7146 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
L451349 +++$+++ u7146 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Keep your shirt on. Let me read.  Westley had no money for marriage. So he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea.
L451348 +++$+++ u7153 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ -- well, when does it get good?
L451347 +++$+++ u7146 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ -- wait, just wait --
L451346 +++$+++ u7153 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book?
L451345 +++$+++ u7153 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ -hold it, hold it-
L451333 +++$+++ u7146 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around.
L451332 +++$+++ u7153 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ Yeah. It's really good.
L451331 +++$+++ u7146 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
L451330 +++$+++ u7146 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right.  The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.
L451329 +++$+++ u7153 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.
L451327 +++$+++ u7153 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ Has it got any sports in it?
L451326 +++$+++ u7146 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
L451325 +++$+++ u7153 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ A book?
L451324 +++$+++ u7146 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Open it up.
L451323 +++$+++ u7153 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ What is it?
L451322 +++$+++ u7146 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ I brought you a special present.
L451814 +++$+++ u7157 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ YELLIN +++$+++ The gate has but one key, and I carry that.
L451813 +++$+++ u7147 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ HUMPERDINCK +++$+++ Double it. My Princess must be safe.
L451812 +++$+++ u7157 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ YELLIN +++$+++ The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
L451811 +++$+++ u7147 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ HUMPERDINCK +++$+++ Rise and report.
L451775 +++$+++ u7147 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ HUMPERDINCK +++$+++ Try ruling the world sometime.
L451774 +++$+++ u7157 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ YELLIN +++$+++ It won't be easy, Sire.
L451773 +++$+++ u7147 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ HUMPERDINCK +++$+++ Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
L451772 +++$+++ u7157 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ YELLIN +++$+++ Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
L451771 +++$+++ u7147 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ HUMPERDINCK +++$+++ She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.
L451766 +++$+++ u7157 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ YELLIN +++$+++ My spy network has heard no such news.
L451765 +++$+++ u7147 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ HUMPERDINCK +++$+++ As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
L451764 +++$+++ u7157 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ YELLIN +++$+++ Sire.
L451763 +++$+++ u7147 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ HUMPERDINCK +++$+++ Yellin.
L452061 +++$+++ u7156 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ WESTLEY +++$+++ Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --
L452060 +++$+++ u7147 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ HUMPERDINCK +++$+++ -- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
L452059 +++$+++ u7156 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ WESTLEY +++$+++ I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
L452058 +++$+++ u7147 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ HUMPERDINCK +++$+++ -- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.
L452055 +++$+++ u7147 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ HUMPERDINCK +++$+++ That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me.
L452054 +++$+++ u7156 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ WESTLEY +++$+++ I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
L452053 +++$+++ u7147 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ HUMPERDINCK +++$+++ I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
L452052 +++$+++ u7156 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ WESTLEY +++$+++ No.  To the pain.
L452051 +++$+++ u7147 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ HUMPERDINCK +++$+++ A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death.
L451696 +++$+++ u7156 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ WESTLEY +++$+++ DEATH FIRST!!
L451695 +++$+++ u7147 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ HUMPERDINCK +++$+++ For the last time -- SURRENDER!
L451693 +++$+++ u7156 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ WESTLEY +++$+++ It will not happen!
L451692 +++$+++ u7147 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ HUMPERDINCK +++$+++ I tell you once again -- surrender!
L451691 +++$+++ u7156 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ WESTLEY +++$+++ Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
L451690 +++$+++ u7147 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ HUMPERDINCK +++$+++ I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
L451689 +++$+++ u7156 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ WESTLEY +++$+++ You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
L451754 +++$+++ u7147 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ HUMPERDINCK +++$+++ Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.
L451753 +++$+++ u7152 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ RUGEN +++$+++ Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.
L451752 +++$+++ u7147 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ HUMPERDINCK +++$+++ Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war.
L451751 +++$+++ u7152 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ RUGEN +++$+++ Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.
L451747 +++$+++ u7147 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ HUMPERDINCK +++$+++ Then we will simply alert him.  Beloved, are you certain he still wants you? After all, it was you who did the leaving in the Fire Swamp. Not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words.
L451746 +++$+++ u7152 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ RUGEN +++$+++ Yes.
L451745 +++$+++ u7147 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ HUMPERDINCK +++$+++ I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  You returned this Westley to his ship?
L451724 +++$+++ u7152 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ RUGEN +++$+++ Of course.
L451723 +++$+++ u7147 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ HUMPERDINCK +++$+++ She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
L451705 +++$+++ u7152 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ RUGEN +++$+++ I swear it will be done.
L451704 +++$+++ u7147 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ HUMPERDINCK +++$+++ Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
L451557 +++$+++ u7147 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ HUMPERDINCK +++$+++ I always think everything could be a trap -- Which is why I'm still alive.
L451556 +++$+++ u7152 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ RUGEN +++$+++ Could this be a trap?
L451555 +++$+++ u7147 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ HUMPERDINCK +++$+++ The loser is nothing. -- Only the Princess matters --  -- clearly this was all planned by warriors of Guilder. We must be ready for whatever lies ahead. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           42.
L451554 +++$+++ u7152 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ RUGEN +++$+++ Shall we track them both?
L451553 +++$+++ u7147 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ HUMPERDINCK +++$+++ The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
L451552 +++$+++ u7152 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ RUGEN +++$+++ Who won? How did it end?
L451551 +++$+++ u7147 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ HUMPERDINCK +++$+++ There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters.
L452086 +++$+++ u7156 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ WESTLEY +++$+++ Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.
L452085 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ You know, it's very strange -- I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.
L452073 +++$+++ u7156 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ WESTLEY +++$+++ In that case --
L452072 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ No.
L452071 +++$+++ u7156 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ WESTLEY +++$+++ I thought he was with you.
L452070 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ Where's Fezzik?
L451981 +++$+++ u7156 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ WESTLEY +++$+++ Light him.
L451980 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ Now?
L451978 +++$+++ u7156 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ WESTLEY +++$+++ Not yet.
L451977 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ Now?
L451960 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ I'll say -- how do I find the Count? -- Once I do, how do I find you again? -- Once I find you again, how do we escape? --
L451959 +++$+++ u7156 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ WESTLEY +++$+++ True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
L451958 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ Why? You can't even lift one.
L451952 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ There we cannot help you.
L451951 +++$+++ u7156 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ WESTLEY +++$+++ Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
L451944 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.
L451943 +++$+++ u7156 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ WESTLEY +++$+++ And our assets?
L451942 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ And it is guarded by sixty men.
L451938 +++$+++ u7156 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ WESTLEY +++$+++ That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
L451937 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
L451936 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ Let me explain --  -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.
L451935 +++$+++ u7156 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ WESTLEY +++$+++ Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --
L451930 +++$+++ u7156 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ WESTLEY +++$+++ I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
L451929 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ Your guess is as good as mine --
L452039 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
L452038 +++$+++ u7152 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ RUGEN +++$+++ -- anything you want --
L452037 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ -- offer me everything I ask for --
L452036 +++$+++ u7152 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ RUGEN +++$+++ -- all that I have and more please --
L452035 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ -- power too -- promise me that --
L452034 +++$+++ u7152 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ RUGEN +++$+++ -- yes --
L452033 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ -- offer me money --
L452032 +++$+++ u7152 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ RUGEN +++$+++ No --
L452030 +++$+++ u7152 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ RUGEN +++$+++ Stop saying that!
L452029 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
L451917 +++$+++ u7150 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ MIRACLE MAX +++$+++ Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
L451916 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ Thank you for everything.
L451910 +++$+++ u7150 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ MIRACLE MAX +++$+++ That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.
L451909 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ Humiliations galore!
L451892 +++$+++ u7150 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ MIRACLE MAX +++$+++ Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said "to blave." And, as we all know, "to blave" means "to bluff." So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated
L451891 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
L451887 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ What's that?
L451886 +++$+++ u7150 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ MIRACLE MAX +++$+++ Now, mostly dead is slightly alive. Now, all dead...well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do.
L451885 +++$+++ u7150 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ MIRACLE MAX +++$+++ Look who knows so much. Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth.
L451884 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ He's dead. He can't talk.
L451883 +++$+++ u7150 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ MIRACLE MAX +++$+++ Your first story was better.  Where's that bellows?  He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him.
L451882 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
L451881 +++$+++ u7150 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ MIRACLE MAX +++$+++ Are you a rotten liar.
L451880 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ This is noble, sir.  His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
L451879 +++$+++ u7150 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ MIRACLE MAX +++$+++ Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.
L451878 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ Sixty-five.
L451877 +++$+++ u7150 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ MIRACLE MAX +++$+++ Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
L451876 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ We're really in a terrible rush.
L451875 +++$+++ u7150 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ MIRACLE MAX +++$+++ Hah?
L451874 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ Sir. Sir.
L451872 +++$+++ u7150 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ MIRACLE MAX +++$+++ He is, eh? I'll take a look. Bring him in.
L451871 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ He's already dead.
L451870 +++$+++ u7150 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ MIRACLE MAX +++$+++ Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
L451865 +++$+++ u7150 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ MIRACLE MAX +++$+++ The King's stinking son fired me. And thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject. While you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it? We're closed!
L451864 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
L451863 +++$+++ u7150 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ MIRACLE MAX +++$+++ What? What?
L451521 +++$+++ u7149 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ MAN IN BLACK +++$+++ I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either --
L451520 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ Kill me quickly.
L451518 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ Okay.
L451517 +++$+++ u7149 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ MAN IN BLACK +++$+++ Get used to disappointment.
L451516 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ I must know.
L451515 +++$+++ u7149 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ MAN IN BLACK +++$+++ No one of consequence.
L451514 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ Who are you?!
L451513 +++$+++ u7149 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ MAN IN BLACK +++$+++ I am not left-handed either.
L451512 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ Tell me.
L451511 +++$+++ u7149 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ MAN IN BLACK +++$+++ There's something I ought to tell you.
L451510 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ I ought to be after twenty years.
L451509 +++$+++ u7149 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ MAN IN BLACK +++$+++ You're amazing!
L451507 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ I am not left-handed.
L451506 +++$+++ u7149 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ MAN IN BLACK +++$+++ And what is that?
L451505 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ Because I know something you don't know.
L451504 +++$+++ u7149 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ MAN IN BLACK +++$+++ Then why are you smiling?
L451503 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ I admit it -- you are better than I am.
L451502 +++$+++ u7149 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ MAN IN BLACK +++$+++ Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
L451501 +++$+++ u7148 +++$+++ m480 +++$+++ INIGO +++$+++ You are wonderful!
