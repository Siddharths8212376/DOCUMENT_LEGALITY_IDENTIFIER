L393021 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ I've got 'im, Joe. Be right along.
L393020 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Chick--
L393010 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Jeff--meet Mr. Cook and Mr. Griffith-- members of our State headquarters here.
L393009 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill!
L392997 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ Here, I'll take a dozen of those things. Miss Paine.
L392996 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Here, Jeff, I'll advance it for you.-- Fine introduction to the nation's capital!
L392988 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ Fine thing Jim Taylor wished on me-- show him the monuments--I need this job like I need ten pounds.
L392987 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ You can't find it in racing forms, Chick.
L393182 +++$+++ u2142 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ NOSEY +++$+++ Okay. See you here.
L393181 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
L393180 +++$+++ u2142 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ NOSEY +++$+++ Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
L393179 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Look, Nosey--your pals would like to get in on this, wouldn't they?
L393175 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Well, well!
L393174 +++$+++ u2142 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ NOSEY +++$+++ What do I *mean*, huh? Uh--*I'll* tell ya--World's Series--a pass! In a month it's worth fifteen bucks!
L393171 +++$+++ u2142 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ NOSEY +++$+++ Saunders--it's meat and drink--lemme at 'im! Five minutes--! I'll make it right with you!
L393170 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Go away, Nosey.
L393169 +++$+++ u2142 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ NOSEY +++$+++ Who? Who? Your boss! A nut, huh? A nut! Wow! There's a *story* in this guy--! I smelled it!
L394175 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ He did it.
L394174 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Every word that boy said is the truth! I'm not fit for office! I'm not fit for any place of honor or trust in this land! Expel me--!
L393910 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ So I go right back where I was-- carrying compromises--covering up-- back to political tricks--this time for--! No! I was just getting rid of all that. If I did *anything*, I ought to go and tell him to stand up and--. No! I don't want any part of it! Smith or anything else! I'm all through. I want to be left alone!
L393909 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
L393908 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ *Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
L393907 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
L393906 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
L393905 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Do you?
L393904 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ What are you talking about? What difference--?
L393903 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
L393902 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Well--me, too!
L393901 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ He's lost complete faith in me--
L393900 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Why don't you do it yourself?
L393899 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Yes--
L393898 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?
L393897 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
L393896 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ What do you want, Senator?
L393261 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ I see. All right. You finish this job properly--and you get a handsome bonus besides--
L393260 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
L393259 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L393258 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Yeah?  And what else?
L393257 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
L393256 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
L393255 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
L393254 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
L393253 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--
L393252 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ No?
L393251 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--
L393250 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Nice *compliment*!
L393249 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ You're the best nurse I can think of--
L393248 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Look, Senator--I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is. What do you need me for? Get somebody else--get a registered nurse--
L393247 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Oh, now--that won't do--
L393246 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ That's right.
L393245 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
L393244 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
L393243 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
L393242 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
L393241 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ No?
L393240 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
L393239 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Yes. Good morning, Saunders.  Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
L393238 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ You want to see me, Senator?
L394053 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Keep doing it! This is the whole works, Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!
L394052 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
L394051 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until--  Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
L394050 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
L394049 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
L394048 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Jim--the boy's talking to that State-- the story is out--!
L393884 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ No--I--I'll take a walk-- 
L393883 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Hey--Joe! Where you going? We've got to celebrate tonight!
L393807 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ But--if he *does*, Joe--
L393806 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Maybe he won't get up.
L393805 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Anything *better* to offer?
L393804 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ It's crucifying him--!
L393803 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ It's in your lap, Joe. Keep an eye on him. If he gets to his feet and says anything--
L393792 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ *I* know what I'm doing! I'll say what I *want*!
L393791 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ You can't say *that* to--
L393790 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Just a minute, Joe!
L393789 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Jim!
L393779 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Congressmen, Radner, Schultz, Diggs--
L393778 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
L393777 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Jeff--this is Mr. Taylor.
L393775 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ I'm glad to see you come to your senses. You had me scared there for a minute, thought.  Let him in.
L393774 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
L393773 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
L393772 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Jim, you don't have to--
L393771 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together.
L393770 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
L393769 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ You won't stand for it?
L393768 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Jim, I won't stand for it.
L393767 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Well, what do you want me to do? Stand around like you chump and let that drooling infant wrap that Willet Creek Dam appropriation around my neck. Either he falls in line with us and behaves himself or I'll break him so wide open they'll never be able to find the pieces.
L393766 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.
L393765 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
L393764 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator, however it happened, he's a Senator. This is Washington.
L393763 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ What do you think?
L393762 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
L393761 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ That's him. Let him in.
L392955 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Chick--turn the ballyhoo boys loose on this right away. Greatest appointment ever made. A banquet-- declare a holiday.
L392954 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
L392953 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
L392952 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.
L392798 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Don't worry about Horace--he'll take orders. Come on--
L392797 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
L392796 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ We can't drop it now, Joe. We bought the land around this Dam and we're holding it in dummy names. If we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations, and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the State under phoney names. No, Joe, in my judgment the only thing to do is push this Dam through--and get it over with.
L392795 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
L392794 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.
L392793 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Joe--what's the matter with you-- where you're concerned, I wouldn't take the slightest risk--'specially now after the great reputation you've made in the Senate. Why, look at this campaign I've started for you in all my papers. You're the logical man from the West on the National ticket--at the convention, anything can happen--
L392792 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
L392791 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
L392790 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?
L392789 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ That'd be a crime--after all this work--getting it buried in this Deficiency Bill as nice as you please-- approved--all ready to roll--
L392788 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Jim--suppose we didn't try to go through with this Willet Creek Dam-- suppose we postpone it until the next session of Congress--or drop it altogether--
L392787 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ That's why I say Miller--Horace Miller. He jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench. He'll take orders.
L392786 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ --in other words, Jim--with this Willet Creek Dam on the fire--the man who goes to the Senate now in Sam Foley's place can't ask any questions or talk out of turn. We must be absolutely sure of him.
L392785 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ That Happy Hopper is tougher to handle than a prima-donna.
L393383 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ And Honest Abe's ideals. A rare man-- these days.
L393382 +++$+++ u2150 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
L393381 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan--you've made another conquest.
L393361 +++$+++ u2150 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ How nice. How do you do, Senator?
L393360 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.
L393359 +++$+++ u2150 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Father--oh.
L393237 +++$+++ u2150 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
L393236 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Do I actually *see* this--?
L393235 +++$+++ u2150 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Such pretty knees for a big boy!
L393234 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ His first 'whiff'!
L393017 +++$+++ u2150 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I'm afraid we won't have room in the car, Father. Senator Smith can follow with Mr. McGann and the pigeons.
L393016 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
L393015 +++$+++ u2150 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ How nice.
L392993 +++$+++ u2150 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.
L392992 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator.
L394166 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Page boys!
L394165 +++$+++ u2146 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator.
L394159 +++$+++ u2146 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
L394158 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?
L394009 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Finally, there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which I rose and gave to this body!  Mr. President--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. And now, he is trying to blackmail this Senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! To prevent his expulsion, he would probably even try to hold up this Deficiency Bill--vital to the whole country--which must be passed immediately--*today*! *Anything*--to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide!  Gentlemen--I--I have no more patience with this--this *rascally* character. I apologize to this body for his appointment--I regret I had ever known him. I--I'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and I refuse to listen to him any longer! I hope every member of this body feels as I do!
L394008 +++$+++ u2146 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Order!
L394006 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ --to avoid bringing disgrace upon a clean and honorable State!
L394005 +++$+++ u2146 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Order!
L394004 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
L393999 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ It was *I* who rose in this Chamber to accuse him. He is saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence--
L393998 +++$+++ u2146 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Senator Paine will state it!
L393978 +++$+++ u2146 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Order!  Will Senator Smith yield to--?
L393977 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Will the Senator yield?
L393973 +++$+++ u2146 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Will Senator Smith yield to--?
L393972 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?
L393294 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ I present the credentials of Honorable Jefferson Smith who has just been appointed Senator by the Governor of my state.
L393293 +++$+++ u2146 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Senator Paine.
