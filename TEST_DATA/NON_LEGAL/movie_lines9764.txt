L174886 +++$+++ u4937 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand.
L175707 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah.  It seems a little crazy, but sometimes <u>you just know</u>.  She's perfect for me.
L175706 +++$+++ u4938 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Edward, are you sure you know what you're doing?
L175551 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I told you, the octopus is made of rubber.  This is a piece o' cake.
L175550 +++$+++ u4938 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Incidentally, you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car...?
L175545 +++$+++ u4938 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ My pleasure.  I'm always happy to assist in a little larceny.
L175544 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
L175543 +++$+++ u4938 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Bravo!  Bravo!  Magnifico!
L175330 +++$+++ u4938 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Eddie, we're in show biz!  It's all about razzle-dazzle.  Appearances. If you dress nice and talk well, people will swallow anything.
L175329 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It's that easy?
L175328 +++$+++ u4938 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.
L175327 +++$+++ u4938 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ I made it up.  It's horseshit!
L175326 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I don't understand.
L175325 +++$+++ u4938 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ I guessed.
L175324 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970?  How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?
L175321 +++$+++ u4938 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ I'm Criswell.  I know all.
L175320 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ H-how'd you know?!
L175319 +++$+++ u4938 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
L175318 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Edward Wood, Sir.
L175317 +++$+++ u4938 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ And who may you be?
L175316 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Wow.
L175774 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Look, he doesn't have any money... but I'll give you everything I've got.  I have a few hundred dollars.
L175773 +++$+++ u4939 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
L175772 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Isn't he?
L175771 +++$+++ u4939 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild.
L175753 +++$+++ u4939 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ We'll do our best.
L175752 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Will he be okay?
L175751 +++$+++ u4939 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.
L175750 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Excuse me.  Doctor?  I'm with Mr. Lugosi.  How is he?
L175634 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Ed... I just stuck it out so you could finish your movie.  Now that it's done, so am I.
L175633 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But you used to say --
L175632 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ I'm tired of living on the fringe.
L175631 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Did you really mean those things you said..?
L175630 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
L175629 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Dolores, wait!
L175541 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.  Quit kidding around.
L175540 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
L175539 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
L175538 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Eddie, what's <u>my</u> motivation?
L175530 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hey, <u>the movie's getting made</u>. That's the main thing.
L175529 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
L175528 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
L175527 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
L175526 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
L175524 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here.  Say, who's the lug?
L175523 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ That's right...
L175522 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene.
L175521 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message.
L175482 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Does she have room for me?
L175481 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ I'm going to my mother's.
L175480 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So WHAT??  Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.
L175479 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ You're a fuckin' mess.
L175478 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ <u>I didn't dump you</u>!  Get it through your skull -- I just recast the part!
L175477 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend.
L175476 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry?  I blew it!  I thought she was rich.
L175475 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
L175474 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
L175473 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ I told you this was gonna happen.
L175472 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Goddamn landlord.
L175388 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ The secretary.  Or the file clerk.
L175387 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Like <u>what</u>?!
L175386 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But there's plenty of other parts.
L175385 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
L175384 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
L175383 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
L175382 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It was the only way I could get the movie made!
L175362 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ All I know is, ever since "Glen Or Glenda," all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes!
L175361 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
L175360 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
L175359 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ That's the problem!  <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!
L175358 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
L175357 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
L175356 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.
L175284 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Well maybe you're not studio kind of material.  Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.
L175283 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ All I wanna do is tell stories.  The things I find interesting...
L175282 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ That's ridiculous.
L175281 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
L175280 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
L175279 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'm no good.
L175171 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Exactly.
L175170 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Toss us out on our ass.
L175169 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Look on the bright side.  If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do?
L175168 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But <u>you</u> do!  And anyway, I've got tons of new scripts.  And now that I have a track record, studios are bound to hire me!
L175167 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
L175166 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
L175165 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ I don't know.  It's so much money...
L175164 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ From today on, our lives are different!  We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did.
L175155 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
L175154 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
L175138 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Say it a little louder.  I don't think Bela heard you in his trailer.
L175137 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
L175136 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
L175135 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
L175075 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Oh, just like in the script!
L175074 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It takes me comfortable.
L175073 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ <u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
L175072 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It's a damn good role.
L175071 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Oh!  You got nerve, buddy.
L175070 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.
L175069 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ And what about this so-called "Barbara" character?  It's obviously ME!  I'm so embarrassed!  This is <u>our</u> <u>life</u>!
L175068 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ What, by putting it in a fuckin' script, for everyone to see?!  What kind of sick mind would operate like that?
L175067 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ This is my way of telling you --
L175066 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
L175065 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.
L175064 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ How long have you been doing this?
L175061 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well, I'd really like to know what you think.  Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it?  I'll Wait...
L175060 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Ed, I'm so proud!  I'll read it as soon as I get home.
L174998 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ So did you get his autograph?
L174997 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It's a shame.  He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
L174996 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
L174995 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No!  He's very alive.  Well... sort of.  He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi!  And he's really nice.
L174994 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ I thought he was dead.
L174993 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!
L174992 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ You met Basil Rathbone!
L174991 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Close!  The <u>other</u> one!
L174990 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Boris Karloff!?
L174989 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No!  A horror movie star!
L174988 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Who?  Robert Taylor?!
L174987 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody <u>really big</u>!
L174986 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Better than not getting a job?
L174985 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
L174984 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ You got the job?!!
L174983 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Sweetie, you won't believe it!  I've got the most incredible news!
L174921 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door.
L174920 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are <u>you</u> the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
L174901 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I know... But sometimes I get scared this is as good as it's gonna get...
L174900 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
L174899 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
L174898 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Ed, it was only one review.
L174897 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it?
L174880 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ The ghost can be barefoot.  <u>Give</u> <u>me your shoes</u>!
L174879 +++$+++ u4940 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ What?
L174878 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Dolores, give me your shoes.
L175446 +++$+++ u4946 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ You misunderstood.  I gave you everything I have in the world: Three-hundred dollars.
L175445 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
L175444 +++$+++ u4946 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ What other sixty-thousand?
L175443 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
L175442 +++$+++ u4946 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
L175441 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I kinda need it now.
L175440 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah.  Exactly!
L175439 +++$+++ u4946 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
L175438 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.
L175401 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I don't know.  Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
L175400 +++$+++ u4946 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Eddie, which dress do you like better?
L175378 +++$+++ u4946 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Hmm.  Those sound kind of small.  Oh, here's one that looks good: Janet Lawton.  I'd sure like to play her.
L175377 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
L175376 +++$+++ u4946 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
L175375 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.
L175374 +++$+++ u4946 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
L175373 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ For this one, we need $60,000.
L175372 +++$+++ u4946 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Perhaps a small amount of money.  How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
L175371 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.
L175368 +++$+++ u4946 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Yes.  Hollywood is oh so exciting.
L175367 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I understand you just moved here?
L175366 +++$+++ u4946 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Pleased to meet you.  I'm Loretta King.
L175005 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well, uh, if I could I would...
L175004 +++$+++ u4953 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ RUDE BOSS +++$+++ He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
L175003 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ That's not true --
L175002 +++$+++ u4953 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ RUDE BOSS +++$+++ Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
L175001 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
L175000 +++$+++ u4953 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ RUDE BOSS +++$+++ He's a <u>bum</u>.
L174905 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz.
L174904 +++$+++ u4953 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ RUDE BOSS +++$+++ Hey big shot, get off your ass.  They need a potted palm over in the Carl Laemmle Building.
L175214 +++$+++ u4947 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.
L175213 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
L175212 +++$+++ u4947 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ Lugosi's washed-up.  What else you got?
L175211 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But Bela Lugosi's in it!
L175210 +++$+++ u4947 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ Oh, "Dr. Acula."  I get it.  I don't like it.
L175209 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ <u>Dr. Acula</u>!
L175208 +++$+++ u4947 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ Doctor Acula?  I don't get it.
L175207 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well, Mr. Feldman, I don't believe in thinking small.  So I've got a whole slate of pictures for you: "The Vampire's Tomb," "The Ghoul Goes West"... and "Doctor Acula"!
L175206 +++$+++ u4947 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ I can't wait to take a look.  So what's up next?
L175205 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
L175204 +++$+++ u4947 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
L175203 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
L175202 +++$+++ u4947 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ Really?!  Well good for you.
L175201 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
L175200 +++$+++ u4947 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ So what are you bringing me?  Looks like you got some film cans.
L175199 +++$+++ u4947 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ Wood?  Ward?  Wood.  Hey, what do you know.  It <u>is</u> Wood. Dang secretaries, you can never get a good one.  Right?
L175198 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It's Wood.  Ed Wood.
L175197 +++$+++ u4947 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ Mr. Ward, it's a delight to meet you.
L176036 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ We are gonna finish this film <u>just</u> <u>the way I want it</u>!  Because you can't compromise an artist's vision!
L176035 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Yes?
L176034 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Mr. Reynolds!
L175999 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Oh, you wanna talk about the "big picture"?!  How 'bout that the policemen arrive in the daylight, but now it's suddenly night???
L175998 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ People won't notice.  Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
L175997 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
L175996 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I like to think so.
L175995 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ "Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
L175994 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ And PERFECT.  CUT!
L175986 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.
L175985 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible!
L175910 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It's plenty!  It's the acorn that will grow a great oak.  I'll just find a double to finish his scenes, and we'll release it as "Bela Lugosi's Final Film"
L175909 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Just, it doesn't look like very much.
L175908 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!
L175907 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ <u>Lugosi</u>??!  Didn't be pass on?
L175906 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
L175905 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
L175904 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
L175903 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ I don't know... this is all a lot to absorb.
