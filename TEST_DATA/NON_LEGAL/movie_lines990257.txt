L481529 +++$+++ u7399 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ RAMÓN +++$+++ What attitude?
L481528 +++$+++ u7401 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...
L481307 +++$+++ u7399 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ RAMÓN +++$+++ Do the bosses wait? No sanitation. So my kids get sick. Does the company doctor wait? Twenty bucks. So we miss one payment on the radio I bought for my wife. Does the company store wait? "Pay -- or we take it away." Why they in such a hurry, the bosses' store? They're trying to scare us, that's why -- to make us afraid to move. To hang on to what we got -- and like it! Well, I don't like it I'm not scared ... and I'm fed up -- to here!
L481306 +++$+++ u7401 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ But you don't pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union. You wait till you're ready, so you can win.
L482520 +++$+++ u7411 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY/TOM +++$+++ I was talking to my wife.
L482519 +++$+++ u7405 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ BO +++$+++ No, I don't mind.  That's how come I told you about it.
L482518 +++$+++ u7411 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY/TOM +++$+++ You mind?
L482517 +++$+++ u7405 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ BO +++$+++ Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
L482516 +++$+++ u7411 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY/TOM +++$+++ You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
L482515 +++$+++ u7405 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ BO +++$+++ Good. I fucking hate Australians.
L482514 +++$+++ u7411 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY/TOM +++$+++ No.
L482513 +++$+++ u7405 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ BO +++$+++ Are you Australian?
L482512 +++$+++ u7411 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY/TOM +++$+++ That's it?
L482511 +++$+++ u7405 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ BO +++$+++ What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway.
L481933 +++$+++ u7406 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ... 
L481932 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.
L481926 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Come on.  Ease off the girl.
L481925 +++$+++ u7406 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What?
L481922 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.
L481921 +++$+++ u7406 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What can I do for you?
L481920 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Yeah.
L481919 +++$+++ u7406 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.
L481916 +++$+++ u7406 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ The spiders.
L481915 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ What?
L481914 +++$+++ u7406 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Shhh.
L481913 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Bobby?
L482610 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Nothing, I'm trying to remember...
L482609 +++$+++ u7407 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ BOOKMAN +++$+++ What is it?
L482607 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ No, Why?
L482606 +++$+++ u7407 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ BOOKMAN +++$+++ Did you see his hair color?
L482605 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.
L482604 +++$+++ u7407 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ BOOKMAN +++$+++ How about in the house?
L482603 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
L482602 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ 
L482601 +++$+++ u7407 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ BOOKMAN +++$+++ Not even a guess?
L482600 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on.
L482585 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I'll see you tonight.
L482584 +++$+++ u7408 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ BUBBA +++$+++ I ain't a idiot, asshole.
L482583 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
L482582 +++$+++ u7408 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ BUBBA +++$+++ Yeah.
L482581 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Everything go?
L482580 +++$+++ u7408 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ BUBBA +++$+++ Yeah.
L482241 +++$+++ u7408 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ BUBBA +++$+++ Get used to it.  You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.
L482240 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice.
L482239 +++$+++ u7408 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ BUBBA +++$+++ I'll have to live with that.  My money my risk, my rules.
L482238 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Now that's down-right insulting.
L482237 +++$+++ u7408 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ BUBBA +++$+++ Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
L482236 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Why? The guys is ready to deal now.
L482235 +++$+++ u7408 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ BUBBA +++$+++ I wanna do a small buy first.  Ten thousand.  We'll see how it goes.
L482040 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ It's downright classy is what it is.
L482039 +++$+++ u7408 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ BUBBA +++$+++ First rate, ain't it?
L482038 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Who wouldn't?
L482037 +++$+++ u7408 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ BUBBA +++$+++ You like that?
L482036 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Ride 'em cowboy)
L482701 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Your daughter needs you.  Go.
L482700 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ I don't want to leave you.
L482699 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Colette, go.
L482689 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ Danny, it's not what you think.
L482688 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You're good, princess. I'll give you that.
L482541 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back.
L482540 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ Why?
L482539 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Will you do that?  Then I want you to get out of the room.
L482537 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ I don't want to.
L482536 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
L482535 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ What is it?
L482534 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
L482533 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ Really, I don't want to.
L482530 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Nothing could be worse then this slow death I'm living now.
L482529 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ They would have killed you too.
L482528 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something.
L482507 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I can't tell you.
L482506 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
L482505 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
L482504 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ What's wrong, Danny?
L482503 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I just can't. Okay?
L482502 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ Why not?
L482498 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ I been that way ever since.
L482497 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Ass first into the world.
L482496 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ From day one.  I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.
L482495 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You always been this stubborn?
L482494 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.
L482493 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Find a new job.
L482492 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ He knows where I work.
L482491 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You can still work.
L482490 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ I need my paycheck.
L482489 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
L482488 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ We been through that.
L482486 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ Please open the door, Danny.
L482485 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I'm kind of busy.
L482484 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ It's me.
L482483 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Who is it?
L482359 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.  And that's how it's gonna stay.
L482358 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
L482357 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Therapy session is over.
L482356 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ What are you hiding, Danny?
L482355 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You don't like the tune, find another station.
L482354 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
L482353 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
L482352 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.
L482351 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ How much time do you have?
L482350 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ What is wrong with you?
L482349 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ How much time do you have?
L482348 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
L482347 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
L482346 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ This has nothing to do with him.
L482345 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after.
L482344 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ You really need to lighten up.
L482343 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ It gets me through the day.
L482342 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
L482341 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ What do you want from me, Colette?
L482340 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ Nothing.
L482339 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ : What are you up to?
L482336 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I try.
L482335 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ Is that how you play?
L482334 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ It's the only way to play.
L482333 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ And you admire that?
L482332 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
L482331 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Nah. I'm strictly minor league... except for the fucked-up part.
L482330 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ Like you?
L482329 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
L482328 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ Never heard of him.
L482327 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Miles Davis. "All Blues."
L482326 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ Trust me. We're safe.
L482325 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ How far out of town?
L482324 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ Don't worry. He's out of town.
L482323 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
L482322 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ What happened to your eye?
L482321 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Oh. Hi.
L482233 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ How?
L482232 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Then make sure he gets put away for longer.
L482231 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ I can't. I've got a kid.  She lives with my parents.  Quincey knows where they live.
L482230 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ That's long enough to get out of town.
L482229 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
L482228 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Why don't you call the cops?
L482227 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ Because he'll kill me.
L482226 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
L482225 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ Fuck you.
L482224 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You get off on abuse or something?
L482223 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ I can't leave.
L482222 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
L482221 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ You don't understand.
L482220 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Why not?
L482219 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ I can't.
L482218 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Then leave.
L482217 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
L482216 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
L482215 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ It's not that easy.
L482214 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
L482213 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ Go ahead.
L482212 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Nothing.
L482211 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ What?
L482210 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Colette ...
L482209 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ Oh, he's a keeper all right.
L482208 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ This man sounds like a real catch.
L482207 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now.
L482206 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Ouch.
L482205 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ Could be worse.  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.
L482203 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ That bad, huh?
L482202 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Leave me out of this.
L482201 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ What about the guy on the very bottom?
L482200 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen.
L482199 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ How?
L482198 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
L482197 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ Oh God.
L482196 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I was thinking Alice Cooper.
L482195 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ Jesus, I look like a raccoon.
L482192 +++$+++ u7409 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ COLETTE +++$+++ I understand. Thanks anyway.
L482191 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.
L482631 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Can you do me a favor? This girl I know, her boyfriend's a real piece of shit-dude's really jamming her up. I promised her I'd try to help.
L482630 +++$+++ u7419 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TRAHN +++$+++ What?
L482629 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Oh shit
L482628 +++$+++ u7419 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TRAHN +++$+++ Hey, you did the right thing. You wouldn't have stood a chance against these boys by yourself. They have eaten your ass alive.
L482627 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
L482626 +++$+++ u7419 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TRAHN +++$+++ How you holding up?
L482620 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ These guys are smart. I knew they wouldn't hit a deal unless they knew all the players. I needed a big buyer.
L482619 +++$+++ u7419 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TRAHN +++$+++ That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
L482618 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I knew that if these were the guys I was looking for, I'd have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able to walk away from it.
L482476 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ How?
L482475 +++$+++ u7416 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
L482474 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?
L482473 +++$+++ u7416 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
L482472 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me.
L482467 +++$+++ u7416 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
L482466 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Maybe I am dealing with it.
