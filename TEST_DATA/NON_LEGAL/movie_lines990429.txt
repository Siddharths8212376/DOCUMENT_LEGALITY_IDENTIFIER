L610099 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
L610098 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably.
L610097 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  They don't want any trouble.
L610096 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Yeah, I guess we should.
L610095 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Well, we should identify ourselves.
L610094 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Well?
L610091 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Epps.  What if they're not Saudi.
L610090 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ We can head back for our lines, and they don't even have to know about the gold.
L610087 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Couldn't be Syria.  We couldn't have gone that far north.  It's got to be Saudi. Come on.
L610086 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?
L610085 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
L610084 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ What do you figure it is?
L610081 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was still alive.  He's gone.  Time for a new deal.
L610080 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
L610079 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
L610078 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Don't you touch it.
L610077 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
L610076 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
L610075 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Just let me rest for a second.
L610074 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ No!
L610073 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.
L610072 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
L610071 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Getting cold.
L610070 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Okay.  Then we go this way.
L610069 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ I pick that way.
L610068 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ You sure you want me too?
L610067 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ We can't just sit here.  We've got to start moving, so pick.
L610065 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ It's got to be going better than this..
L610064 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Wonder how the war's going?
L610063 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ If we can find the Hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that.  But we won't make another day otherwise.
L610062 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ What do you think our chances are?
L610061 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Damn.
L610060 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Sorry.
L610058 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ I never had anything before, Epps.  I never was anybody.  Not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins.  When I was in high school I used to--
L610057 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.
L610056 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
L610055 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Makes two of us.
L610054 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ I don't want to die.
L610053 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Yeah.
L610052 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Epps?
L610051 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ What?  Yeah.
L610050 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ You still got a map on you?
L610049 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
L610048 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Sure.
L610047 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
L610046 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Yeah.  Well, me too.
L610045 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.
L610043 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Is it all right if I stand up?
L610042 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ I'm sorry about that, Epps.
L610039 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ That helicopter passes, and the only thing we're close to is death.
L610038 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
L610037 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ And you; you've got it all together.
L610036 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
L610035 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ First Wes, now you?
L610031 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ They'll search the pack.
L610030 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ We'll lie.
L610029 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
L610028 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.
L610027 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ No.
L610026 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ We need something:  A flare, a signal mirror.
L610025 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ No.
L610019 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.
L610018 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ What if he's not?
L610017 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Wes is dead!
L610016 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ We can't just leave him.
L610015 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Forget Wes.
L610014 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ We got to go back.  We got to go back for Wes.
L610000 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ We'll find our way!  We'll...
L609999 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ How!?
L609998 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ We'll find our way.
L609997 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
L609973 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ You think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you're wrong, and you're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it.  We're heading Northeast.
L609972 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
L609971 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
L609970 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
L609969 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ We should head Northeast.
L609900 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.
L609899 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Wes might be right about that.
L609891 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Not when you're up here with the gold, I guess not.
L609890 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.
L609889 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ What the hell took so long.
L609882 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work.
L609881 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ All right.  You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow.
L609878 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Someone's got to send the gold up.  It can't get on the line by itself.
L609877 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ I don't see how that plan's any better.
L609876 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Jesus, Jaeger.
L609875 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Why do I have to stay down here?
L609872 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...
L609871 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ He's not going to leave us.
L609870 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
L609869 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ What?
L609868 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ What?
L609867 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Wait.
L609862 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ You don't have to imagine it.  Not anymore.  Now all you've got to think up is what it's going to buy you.
L609861 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
L609860 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And it's heavier than I imagined.
L609853 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Yeah, Bwana, you got it.
L609852 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Is it dead?
L609851 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ It's just a mongoose.
L609848 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ It's giving.
L609847 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
L609845 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
L609844 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Must be a compartment.
L609840 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Get up off your ass and dig!
L609839 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
L609838 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Get up and dig.
L609837 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
L609836 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ It looks like you're not doing anything.
L609835 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ What does it look like I'm doing?
L609834 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ What are you doing?
L609828 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ So where do we start?
L609827 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ A whole lot of nothing.
L609822 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns.
L609821 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Think there might be more Iraqis?
L609802 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ If they land, we can take them.  If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about.
L609801 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ If they land--
L609798 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ They can't shoot us in here.
L609797 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ They're going to kill us!
L609796 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ We're not going to do anything.
L609795 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?
L609794 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Just stay down.
L609793 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Where the hell is it!?
L609792 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Stay low.
L609791 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Where is it?  Where'd it go?
L609777 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ I hope it means something, otherwise...
L609776 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
L609775 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Something like that.
L609774 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ X marks the spot.
L609751 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
L609750 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Not enough.  We're out numbered and out gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.
L609738 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
L609737 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ They're doing more than slapping.
L609733 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
L609732 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
L609731 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ What are they doing here?
L609730 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Iraqis.  A bunch of them.
L609727 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight. That's not a battle going on.
L609726 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ It's a fire fight.
L609725 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Don't!
L609723 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Shut up and listen!
L609722 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ I don't hear any--
L609718 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.
L609717 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?
L609714 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.
L609713 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ You're not losing trust, are you?
L609709 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ It's the treasure, that's what it is.
L609708 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ This.  Whatever it is.
L609705 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.
L609704 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
L609703 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
L609702 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ You're going to blow yourselves up.
L609687 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
L609686 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
L609685 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!
L609684 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ You're going to be fine.
L609683 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ That's going to do it, right?  I'm going to be okay.
L609682 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
L609681 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ How's this going to work?
L609680 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
L609679 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
L609678 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.
L609677 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ My leg is falling asleep.
L609673 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
L609672 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
L609670 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Epps...
L609669 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ There's a way.
L609662 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!
L609661 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
L609660 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ We're going to be right over here.
L609659 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Why you got to move away to talk!?
L609658 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Me and Wes are just going to talk.
L609657 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Where you going?
L609656 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ We're going to get off, all right.  We'll get you off of there.  Just...be cool.
L609655 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
L609654 +++$+++ u8408 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Just relax.
