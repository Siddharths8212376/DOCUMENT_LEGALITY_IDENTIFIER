L401560 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Thank you, won't you come in ?
L401559 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Hi. I brought some wine.
L401558 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Hello.
L401496 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Sure.
L401495 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?
L401494 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ As appealing as that sounds...
L401493 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.
L401492 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Yes.
L401491 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Really ? On a date ?
L401490 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Yes.
L401489 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
L401488 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Do you want to go out with me ?
L401487 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Listen, I was thinking, you know. Would you go, it's I think you're...
L401486 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ I've never heard the Flintstones reduced to a sexual exploitation quite like that. You're funny.
L401485 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Come on, I'm serious. Look at Wilma. She's this frail little thing, and Fred, I mean Fred Flintstone is this BIG guy. He has to be hung like a horse, and THAT's why Wilma puts up with his B.S.
L401423 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Excuse me, gentlemen
L401422 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Just look at this tie. You could fry an egg off that orange, yow. Have you ever considered the Jerry Garcia line of ties ?
L401421 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ I meant him.
L401420 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Thank you.
L401419 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !
L401439 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Maybe we should make the time. Especially considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to settle law suits from these very events.
L401438 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
L401437 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
L401436 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ We start with the top and work our way down. We start with the high salaries and then just let the little people go. No need to make the blue collars go crazy.
L401417 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Were you involved in the incident where that guy killed himself in his office ?  I am sorry. Perhaps we should have dinner tonight to.... discuss your future.
L401416 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
L401415 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
L401414 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
L401413 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
L401412 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Good morning.
L401411 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Good morning.
L403532 +++$+++ u6744 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Humph, meee?? My dear, this is not a country that rewards poetry, this is a country that rewards gas mileage, besides, people don't read poetry anymore, they watch television. Don't be a poet, be a TV repairman.
L403531 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
L403530 +++$+++ u6744 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
L403529 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
L403528 +++$+++ u6744 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
L403527 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ People said she looked like me.
L403524 +++$+++ u6744 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Ohhhhh.
L403523 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
L403522 +++$+++ u6744 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
L403521 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ My mother took this course with you at UCLA...&quot;The Foundations of Poetic Thought&quot;.
L403520 +++$+++ u6744 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ No, no, no, I gave it up ten years ago...actually it gave me up.
L403519 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Do you still teach?
L403518 +++$+++ u6744 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Oh, just put it over there.
L403517 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Umm, where do you want this?
L403510 +++$+++ u6744 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ No, I'm writing to the phone company because they keep charging me for calls to Caracas, Venezuela...do you know any know anybody in Caracas, Venezuela?
L403509 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Are you writing a poem?
L403508 +++$+++ u6744 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ You had to remind me?
L403295 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ I don't even know your name.
L403294 +++$+++ u6745 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Don't mention it.
L403293 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ THANK YOU.
L403292 +++$+++ u6745 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;.
L403291 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ I don't think you're very polite.
L403290 +++$+++ u6745 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
L403289 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!
L403288 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Gee, that is a problem.
L403287 +++$+++ u6745 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ My only problem is that your Uncle Phil is giving me five bucks to pick you up but I don't get paid 'till delivery.
L403286 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem.
L403285 +++$+++ u6745 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
L403284 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ This is California, anything is possible.
L403283 +++$+++ u6745 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
L403282 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
L403281 +++$+++ u6745 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Your Uncle Phil told me.
L403280 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ How did you know my name?
L403279 +++$+++ u6745 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ You're Vada right?
L403278 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
L403277 +++$+++ u6745 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Excuse me I asked you a question.
L403746 +++$+++ u6746 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ DARYL +++$+++ Me, I'll know!
L403745 +++$+++ u6754 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ So charge him with something...who's gonna know?
L403738 +++$+++ u6746 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ DARYL +++$+++ You're still asking me to break the law.
L403737 +++$+++ u6754 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
L403736 +++$+++ u6746 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ DARYL +++$+++ I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.
L403735 +++$+++ u6754 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Look, sergeant I know I said some things last time that I shouldn't have said at all but...
L403734 +++$+++ u6746 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ DARYL +++$+++ I thought I told you to lose this guy.
L403733 +++$+++ u6754 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
L403427 +++$+++ u6746 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ DARYL +++$+++ What about living in the real world pal?
L403426 +++$+++ u6754 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What about giving the other guy a break.
L403425 +++$+++ u6746 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ DARYL +++$+++ Well maybe you should join a hippie commune. But let me tell you something. Sooner or later it's gonna be your turn to take out the garbage.
L403422 +++$+++ u6746 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ DARYL +++$+++ I would do it again in a minute.
L403421 +++$+++ u6754 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
L403748 +++$+++ u6746 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ DARYL +++$+++ Hello, I'm gonna need this right now...this guy...well we think he might be going after the governor.  Twenty minutes? Fine.
L403747 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life?
L403744 +++$+++ u6746 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ DARYL +++$+++ Could you hold on for a second? 
L403743 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ I'm leaving Sunday.
L403742 +++$+++ u6746 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ DARYL +++$+++ Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.
L403741 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Pommeroy.
L403740 +++$+++ u6746 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ DARYL +++$+++ Yeah, this is Sergeant Tanaka from Holenbeck, I need a current address for a Jeffrey....
L403732 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ His name is Jeffrey Pommeroy and he used to drive a 54 Ford pickup, black with red interior. Please?
L403731 +++$+++ u6746 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ DARYL +++$+++ I'm not authorized to trace licenses for civilians.
L403420 +++$+++ u6746 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ DARYL +++$+++ Everyone was really surprised when Maggie was turned in, she got kicked out for two weeks.
L403419 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Suspended from school, my mother??
L403418 +++$+++ u6746 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ DARYL +++$+++ She was the uhh...first girl ever suspended for smoking.
L403415 +++$+++ u6746 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ DARYL +++$+++ You kidding? he picks up a picture and shows Vada and Nick
L403414 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Wow, you walked out with my mother?
L403413 +++$+++ u6746 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ DARYL +++$+++ Well, we worked on the school paper together. I remember when the Legion of Decency declared Rebel without a Cause unfit...boy...that Jim Backers, what an actor uh? What an actor.
L403412 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ What do you remember about her.
L403411 +++$+++ u6746 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ DARYL +++$+++ It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way.
L403887 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You can do anything you want. You're his sister.
L403886 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Can I see him?
L403885 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
L403884 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ We have a baby?
L403883 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ She just had a baby that's all.
L403882 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ What happened to Shelly?
L403727 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Give my love to Shelly.
L403726 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I love you too sweetie, bye.
L403725 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
L403724 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
L403723 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ I will. How's Shelly?
L403722 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
L403721 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Totally.
L403720 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Totally groovy huh?
L403719 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Yeah.
L403716 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.
L403715 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
L403714 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
L403713 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Hi honey.
L403712 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Hi Dad.
L403711 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Hello? Sultenfuss Parlor.
L403272 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Have fun.
L403271 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ I'll be back in 137 hours.
L403270 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Thanks, I needed that.
L403269 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
L403268 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the damn plane already?
L403267 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ What does that mean?
L403266 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.
L403265 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ No nuns, got it.
L403252 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ I used my own money and got a great deal, it's a Q47NR five day fare, which means that I have to change planes in Dallas and stay over a Saturday.
L403251 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What??
L403250 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ I already bought a ticket.
L403249 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
L403248 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
L403247 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Of course.
L403246 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
L403188 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Oh yes, lovely funeral, Gernaldi brothers did a beautiful job, lots of pink roses...I used the white hearse. Hey, how about this flowered wallpaper for your room?
L403187 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Was it a nice funeral?
L403186 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ She was talented, but honey I wish I could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and I had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.
L403183 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.
L403182 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
L403181 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
L403180 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ There's still a big spot on the floor.
L403144 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Her favorite poet.
L403143 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer
L403124 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over anxious, so if you think there's a boy that might like you, let him know that you like him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk when he's thinking of asking you out.
L403123 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ So you're saying...What are you saying??
L403118 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ It's just a question, it's not about anybody.
L403117 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What boy likes you?
L403116 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend that he doesn't like you? And if he pretends that he doesn't like you how can you tell that he likes you?
L403090 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Great.
L403089 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Seriously.
L403088 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Seriously?
L403087 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
L403086 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
L403085 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
L403084 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.
L403083 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room.
L403082 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Honey that's very mature, I'm proud of you Vada.
L403081 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ No it's okay, I understand, really.
L403080 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been a lot of changes, and I know you're upset about losing your room, but the baby's gotta go somewhere.
L403078 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ I figured you did.
L403077 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.
L403076 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Shelly's already told me all about sex.
L403075 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
L403074 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
L403073 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
L403072 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ So, what's on your mind?
L403071 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Well you know what I mean.
L403070 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Visualize a spare?
L403063 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Okay thanks, atta girl.
L403062 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Okay, no problem.
L403061 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.
L403060 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ You want me to move?
L403059 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
L403058 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Do what?
L403054 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.
L403053 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing.
L403035 +++$+++ u6760 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Dad, I'm trying.  The chairs, they won't scrunch.
L403034 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Vada, try to scrunch these chairs together a little more.
L403901 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Maybe he's hungry.
L403900 +++$+++ u6758 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Maybe he's wet?
L403893 +++$+++ u6758 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ I was pushing as fast as I could.
L403892 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey.
L403261 +++$+++ u6758 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Phil's moving to LA, Grammoo's passing, the baby being born, Vada's report, I think...
L403260 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Reason? What reason?
L403257 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I really think we're going overboard for just a simple school assignment.
L403256 +++$+++ u6758 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
L403255 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yeah and they forgot to ask for one who wasn't having hormone surges.
L403244 +++$+++ u6758 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ You're being narrow-minded.
L403243 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.
L403242 +++$+++ u6758 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of...
L403241 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ She can spread her wings, right here in Pennsylvania. You don't send a child alone to Los Angeles, she could come back with her ears pierced, her legs shaved and God knows what else.
L403176 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Ah, well, I bought her this huge pumpkin for Halloween, but she couldn't bear to carve it so she saved it for weeks, and it ended up under the Christmas tree.
L403175 +++$+++ u6758 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ No.
L403174 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I told you about the pumpkin didn't I?
L403147 +++$+++ u6758 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ And some taco chips so I can dunk.
L403146 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ How about a nice glass of milk?
L403145 +++$+++ u6758 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Never heard of him. 
L403142 +++$+++ u6758 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Yes I know, it runs in the family.  New book?
L403141 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Well if there was an article about it I'm sure she did. She was always reading.
L403122 +++$+++ u6758 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars.
L403121 +++$+++ u6747 +++$+++ m450 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Oh, Shell, that's ridiculous, where are my needle nosed pliers?
