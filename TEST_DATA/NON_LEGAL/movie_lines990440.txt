L615463 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I'm so sorry!
L616508 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Get it!
L616507 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ On the drunk.
L616506 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Where did you hide it?
L616505 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
L616504 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
L616503 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
L616268 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
L616267 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Say--wait a minute!
L616266 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Sure! McKinney will never suspect you--
L616265 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ <U>Me</U>!
L616264 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ You keep it-- 
L615934 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Sure--and to show you I'm a regular fella--  Here's that twenty-five hundred. 
L615933 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Partners, ain't we?
L615932 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ About sixteen hundred.
L615923 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
L615922 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
L615921 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ What is it?
L615920 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
L615908 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I'll take one. 
L615907 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Thank you, sir. 
L615906 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Thank you.  I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
L615905 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Here's your twenty-five hundred, Mr. Brett.
L615884 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Brett--right away.
L615883 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
L615876 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ That's where you come in. Now, listen, Shortie--
L615875 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
L615874 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ They won't squawk--they're professionals.
L615858 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Well, I had to get some dough to play with those suckers. Here, get this changed.
L615857 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ You take some awful chances.
L615856 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.
L615855 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ You know where that sense of humor's goin' to get you one of these days--
L615854 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
L615853 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Are you screwy?
L615852 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Inspector McKinney.
L615577 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Now you're talkin'!
L615576 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
L615575 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
L615574 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Shortie!--you know my motto?
L615569 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ A dollar forty--out of the two dollars I gave you.
L615568 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Change?
L615567 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ My change.
L615566 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ No, sir?
L615565 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
L615561 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
L615560 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
L615559 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. 
L615558 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ This is a business trip!
L615557 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ A thousand? She's one in a million--right off the top of the rosebush!
L615556 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ --there's thousands of 'em!
L615555 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Oh, Shortie!--  --there's a girl on this ship--
L615554 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Don't let money spoil a beautiful friendship. Look at these here telegrams to be delivered! This ain't a job-- it's a marathon.
L615553 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
L615552 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
L615551 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
L615550 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Not a chance.
L615549 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
L615548 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ A dollar forty.
L615547 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ How're the tips?
L615546 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
L615545 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
L615544 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.
L615448 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.
L615447 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ You don't think--?
L615440 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Shortie, look!
L615439 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
L615435 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Oh, no--You're not gonna give my hard-earned money away.
L615434 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Quick, let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.
L615427 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ I'll watch for him, sir.
L615426 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ He's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.
L615425 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
L615424 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Nix, the law!
L615423 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ I'll give you half of it.  Here's seventy cents. 
L615422 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
L615421 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
L615420 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
L615419 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
L615418 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
L615417 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ We coulda got two third-class!
L615416 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
L615415 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship. 
L615414 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I thought you were a smart guy.
L615413 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
L615412 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
L615411 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Not here--follow me around the shed.
L616375 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Make it three, boys--I'll play this hand pat.
L616374 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ That goes two ways.
L616370 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Think again--
L616369 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ I thought you were a sucker--
L616366 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Why isn't that a good time to quit?
L616365 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
L616364 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.
L616086 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Much better--thank you--
L616085 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ How's your mother feeling?
L615918 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ It's a pleasure.
L615917 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ It's your deal.
L615901 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ That beats two Pairs. I'm glad <U>I</U> didn't win the first pot. Take the money, Mr. Brett.
L615900 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Three Jacks.
L615899 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ Don't worry about that.  We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?
L615898 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I'll bet a couple of hundred--  I wonder what's keeping that boy.
L615881 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
L615880 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ Come in! 
L616527 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Thanks. That makes us square.
L616526 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Here's your fifty.
L616485 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Why, I--
L616484 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Mmmmmmmmmhm....  Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?
L616476 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
L616475 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Don't get yourself all worked up--
L616464 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
L616463 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you-- 
L616350 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Anybody that's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back.
L616349 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Nice girl, that--  I'd hate to see <U>her</U> get a raw deal.  You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're <U>too</U> smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.
L616346 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ It's a bet--come on, Sally!
L616345 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Wouldn't bet against her.  Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France.  Not a hundred, though--just fifty.
L616273 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Nooooo!--going to catch up on my reading.  I'll take this one.
L616272 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Coming to the pool for a swim?
L616271 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Hello, young fellow!
L616249 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Then we run our hands down a man's arms and legs-- like this--in case they got what you're looking for attached to a string.  See what I mean, Purser?
L616248 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Hey!--you're tickling me.
L616247 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
L616246 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ How about trying your fine Italian hand?
L616245 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ It's easy to see the Purser hasn't had much practice.
L616243 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Swell!
L616242 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ I'll go with you.
L616241 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Sure, I'll go.
L616240 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
L616239 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Why?
L616238 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
L616237 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
L616236 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ How about you?
L616231 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap? 
L616230 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
L616183 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Good night!
L616182 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
L616181 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?
L616177 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ I wouldn't be surprised--
L616176 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
L616175 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
L616174 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
L616173 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
L616172 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
L616146 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.
L616145 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Care to join us?
L616110 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ I'll go with you--
L616109 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I'm going to the show--
L615774 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ No--not quite.
L615773 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
L615772 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Before that. Your face is very familiar.
L615771 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Oh, yes. On the pier.
L615770 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.
L616502 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ If you hadn't agreed--I was going to throw you overboard-- 
L616501 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ What's that?
L616500 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
L616499 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
L616498 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?
L616497 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ She did?
L616496 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ I won't--I'll ask for one right now.  Sally tells me she's in love with you.
L616047 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Good!  At last you're making yourself useful. So long!
L616046 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I should say not.
L616045 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ I don't know what it is, but I won't use it.  Is she entertaining you?
L615989 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ I would--but our rehearsal starts right away.  Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an important part of my show. Some day--not now--when you get a chance--let her come to just one rehearsal. I'll appreciate it.
L615988 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
L615987 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
L615986 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?
L615840 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Never mind--I'll pay for it now. It'll save time.
L615839 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ Wait a minute--let's match for it.
L615838 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ That's all right. I'll attend to this.
L615786 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ I'm sorry to hear that.
L615785 +++$+++ u8467 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ BRETT +++$+++ I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
L615784 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ That's too bad.
