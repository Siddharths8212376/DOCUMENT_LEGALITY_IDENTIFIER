L393379 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Goodnight, Miss Paine.
L393378 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Goodnight, Jeff.
L393377 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Well--goodnight.
L393376 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Good as new! It's quite all right--
L393375 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Gosh!  Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll--
L393374 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
L393373 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--
L393358 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Well, I'm sort of anxious to get back to the office--
L393357 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Here--where are you running off to?
L393356 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
L393355 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Nonsense, Jeff.
L393354 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ I will, sir! I will!  I--I don't know how to thank you. I knew, if any man could help me--
L393353 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ What's to stop you? Saunders will help you with it--
L393352 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--
L393351 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
L393350 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Yes, I was--
L393349 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?
L393348 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Well, then--I--I don't feel I can stay, sir.
L393347 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--
L393346 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ I mean, sir--if I'm going to stay in the Senate--I ought to know what I'm doing--at least, I ought to try to study the Bills that are coming up--
L392980 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ No.
L392979 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
L392978 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
L392977 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
L392976 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
L392975 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
L392974 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ You don't have to tell me Jeff. We were a team, the two of us, a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer. The twin champions of lost causes, they used to call us.
L392973 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
L392972 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.
L392971 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Thank you, sir.
L392970 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ "Boy Stuff." Why, printer's ink runs in your veins, Jeff. You're just like your father.
L392969 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Well, it isn't much, but if you insist, here's this week's. 
L394193 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ We'd better see.
L394192 +++$+++ u2140 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Just fine.
L394191 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ How's Amos, Ma?
L394190 +++$+++ u2140 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Certainly would, Joseph.
L394189 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
L394188 +++$+++ u2140 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Fine--
L394187 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Hello, Ma.  Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
L394186 +++$+++ u2140 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Hello, Jefferson.
L392936 +++$+++ u2140 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ What?
L392935 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Now, Amos, now--  What?
L392922 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Sorry about this, Governor. But it won't take a minute. You were saying something in the other room, sir--
L392921 +++$+++ u2140 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Satan's in this little fella tonight!
L392920 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Now, now, now--that isn't going to get you any place. Get a firm grip, Ma!
L392916 +++$+++ u2140 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Now, now, now!  It's all right, Governor.
L392915 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Jerry! Blackie! Queenie! Let's have it quiet, fellows!
L392911 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Gosh! You see sir--I was fixing some plaster for a cast on Amos' leg-- he's always chewing 'em off. I'll only be a minute--if you'll excuse me, sir--
L392910 +++$+++ u2140 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
L392909 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Yes, Ma?
L392908 +++$+++ u2140 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Jefferson--
L392907 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Oh, now--
L392896 +++$+++ u2140 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Well--I'll go to Halifax!
L392895 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Good evening, sir. I was just making some--  Governor Hopper!
L393798 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ You're a liar!
L393797 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--
L393796 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?
L393795 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Can't you?
L393788 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Mine? Why--naturally--whatever benefits the state is mighty important to me--owning a lot of its industry-- newspapers and other odds and ends. And if I thought you had the welfare of the state at heart, like myself-- for instance, if you were to turn around and help a project like this along instead of standing in the way-- why, I'd say you were a man to watch. For a fellow your age, you'd be in a spot to make a great start in life. If you liked business--you could pick any job in the state and go right to the top. Or politics. If you like being a Senator. No reason why you couldn't come back to that Senate for the rest of your life.
L393787 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
L393786 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--
L393785 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Yes, so I was told, Mr. Taylor, but--
L393784 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--
L393783 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Like what, Mr. Taylor?
L393782 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Well. I hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. Pitching right in. Lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. You're smart. In fact, *I* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you--
L394195 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!
L394194 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!
L393943 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ To a hard night's work, son. Come on! 
L393942 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Where do we go from here?
L393941 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Hurray!
L393940 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Yay!
L393939 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ We'll *find* one! Only throw compromise out of the window--stick to Jeff Smith, the man who first came to this town--get up and *fight*-- and we'll find *some* way. I don't know where we'll wind up--but the flag'll be flying--!
L393938 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Saunders--if there was *any* way--
L393937 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
L393936 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Oh--Saunders--
L393935 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
L393934 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ But--I've done everything I--
L393933 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ What you *have* to do is fight!
L393932 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Wait--
L393931 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*! 
L393930 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--
L393929 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Well, I guess it's a chance.
L393928 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
L393927 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way.
L393925 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ I--I don't know. I--I'm afraid they've got me licked.
L393924 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L393923 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ That's funny. I thought all along--  Gee--I--I'm glad to see you. I *thought* of you--I mean--I wanted to talk to someone and--well--  --Mr. Lincoln hasn't much to say--  Saunders--I'm not fit to sit up in the Senate--haven't you heard?--I robbed boys of their pennies and dimes!
L393922 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ No. That night--I--well, *you* know-- I was pretty--. No--Diz is a--a sort of brother, that's all--
L393921 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ I'm not.
L393920 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Well gee--how--how've you been, Saunders? I--I haven't seen you in-- . I suppose--now that you're married--
L393919 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Saunders--
L393918 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Hello.
L393728 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Are you drunk?
L393727 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!
L393726 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Saunders--!
L393725 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ I know. Don't tell me. It was a wonderful party. Your suit went over big. And she looked beautiful, and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--"Thank you, Mr. Smith." Oh, but it was the way she *said* it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish!
L393630 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Wow!
L393629 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
L393628 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ *Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
L393627 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
L393616 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ I mean it. I--without you, I could't've--
L393615 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Don't mention it--
L393614 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ I--I--gee whiz--I didn't thank you!
L393613 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Oh--*Saunders*!
L393612 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Thanks a lot.
L393611 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
L393610 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Do you want to dictate them?
L393609 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate! 
L393608 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Not another bill?
L393607 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
L393606 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Second drawer.
L393605 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?
L393604 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
L393603 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Already? All these letters?
L393602 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
L393601 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
L393600 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Must have been tickled pink.
L393599 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
L393598 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Great.
L393597 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
L393596 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
L393595 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ What do they--? Who are all those--?
L393544 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Yeah. This land to be bought by contributions from the boys. You have that. Money to be--
L393543 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him.  "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"
L393542 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Well--no. I didn't. Why?
L393541 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ No, I haven't. I guess I thought the name was familiar.  By the way, you discussed with Senator Paine where the camp was to be situated and everything?
L393540 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ You couldn't. You've never been out there, you said.
L393539 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ No--
L393538 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ You--don't know it, do you?
L393537 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ In Terry Canyon?
L393536 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream--
L393532 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Yes. The most beautiful I think I ever--gee--  Say--we're *never* going to finish this thing! Now, here we go, Saunders. I'm going to talk faster'n you can write--
L393531 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
L393530 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
L393529 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
L393528 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--
L393527 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ You win. It's--Clarissa.
L393526 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ I've got more. You better tell me.
L393525 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ No! Stop it!
L393524 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Lena.
L393523 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ No!
L393522 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Letitia.
L393521 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ No!
L393520 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Abigail.
L393519 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ It *is* not!
L393518 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ I know. It's--Violet.
L393517 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Well, if it's all the same to you--
L393516 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
L393515 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Look--I think we ought to skip it.
L393514 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
L393513 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ I also answer to whistles.
L393512 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
L393511 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Why?
L393510 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
L393509 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Terrible, thank you.
L393508 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
L393507 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Go right ahead.
L393506 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
L393505 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ I don't see where we are *with* it.
L393504 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ I never met anyone more--more intelligent--or capable. I--I don't know where I'd be on this bill of mine without your help--
L393503 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Have I?
L393502 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
L393501 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ No complaints.
L393500 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ It hasn't been easy, has it?
L393499 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
L393498 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
L393497 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Since sixteen or so.
L393496 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Have you always had to--work?
L393495 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
L393494 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
L393493 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
L393492 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ You mean--here?
L393489 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ I've been over every foot of it. You couldn't have any idea. You'd have to see for yourself--  --the prairies--the wind leaning on the tall grass--
L393488 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ No.
L393487 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ About two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were! Mountains, prairie land, trees, streams! A paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities--  You don't know that country out there, do you, Miss Saunders?
L393486 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course--
L393485 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Yes, yes--
L393484 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Uh--getting back to this, Senator--
L393483 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
L393482 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ He did?
L393481 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.
L393480 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
L393479 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Well--gosh--that--that isn't "particulars," is it?
L393477 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ I want to make that come to life-- yes, and lighted up like that, too-- for every boy in the land. Boys forget what their country means--just reading "land of the free" in history books. And they get to be men--and forget even more. Liberty is too precious to get buried in books, Miss Saunders. Men ought to hold it up in front of them--every day of their lives and say: "I am free--to think--to speak. My ancestors couldn't. I can. My children will."
L393476 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ On paper?
L393473 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ And something else, too, Miss Saunders-- the spirit of it--the idea--the--
L393472 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--
L393471 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ I did--and--and I got right up.
L393470 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Try sitting down.
L393469 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
L393468 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Yes, Senator--*twice*.
L393467 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ --that's the main idea, Miss Saunders. The United States Government isn't going to buy or build this camp-- just lend us the money. You've made a note of that, huh?
L393451 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ And a *lot* of paper!
L393450 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Thanks very much.
L393449 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ No! Go right ahead, Miss Saunders.
L393448 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Yes--sure. Why not?  You don't mind if I take the time to get a pencil?
L393447 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ I said--shall we get started *now* or--
L393446 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Pardon?
L393445 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
