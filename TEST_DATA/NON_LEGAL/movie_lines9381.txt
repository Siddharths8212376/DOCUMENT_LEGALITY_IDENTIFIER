L507081 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ The picture's dead.
L507080 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
L507079 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
L507077 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.
L507076 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ You're not renewing my contract.
L507075 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ -- Christ, Viktor, look around. What do you think pays for all this?  This is about investment and return.  Those days in New York... that's... it's over.
L507074 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Spare me.
L507073 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
L507072 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ -- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
L507071 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ -- It's called a projector.
L507070 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
L507069 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
L507068 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
L507067 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ It's the truth.  Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy.  We can't open -- can't make a profit without them.
L507066 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Please.
L507065 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ The public decides who's on that list.
L507064 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Elaine, she doesn't have any children!  Don't you see?  We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the A-list.
L507063 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ -- What's wrong with that?
L507062 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ -- I'll tell you why.  It is because Miss Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card God's gift to cinema, has it written into her contract that all cherry Mike & Ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened, that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room, and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first class.
L507061 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ -- I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
L507060 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ -- overseeing the most cherished movie project of my career, am walking around with a pocketful of cherry Mike & Ike's?
L507059 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ -- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
L507058 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
L507057 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
L507056 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ -- Do you know what these are, Elaine?
L507055 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Difficult.  I'm difficult.
L507054 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ God, Viktor.  Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
L507053 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Excuse us.
L507052 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ No!  You will not give in to that blackmailing bitch!
L507049 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ We don't need a name.  We'll cast an unknown.
L507048 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Of course she is.  No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.
L507761 +++$+++ u2782 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE +++$+++ Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
L507760 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Where are you?
L507759 +++$+++ u2782 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE +++$+++ Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.
L507758 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you, Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk to you.
L507757 +++$+++ u2782 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE +++$+++ Hello, is this Elaine?
L507756 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Hello?
L507951 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ Listen to what you're saying, mom. Is there any evidence she is?
L507950 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
L507949 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ -- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
L507948 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Well, I --
L507947 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ I know it's embarrassing to admit it, mom, but when I think about it -- honestly, I haven't.  I mean, it feels like I have.  I know more about her than members of my own family.  She's even in my dreams. But I realized, going back through my diary, they were all TV appearances, near misses at parties, second-hand rumor, gossip on the internet.  I've never actually seen Simone up close, touched her, been in her physical presence.  Have you?
L507946 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
L507945 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Of course.  What are you suggesting?
L507944 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ So you did meet her?
L507943 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met.
L507942 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ Because obviously she existed, right?
L507941 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ God, it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that.
L507940 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ Just a minute.
L507939 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.
L507731 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ It was a great show, Dad...
L507730 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Thank Simone for the tickets.
L507662 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Sometimes.  But, just when I think your father's changing for the better, I realize he's as self absorbed as ever.  He took the credit for Simone tonight.
L507661 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ Mom, do you miss Dad?
L507737 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I have to talk to her.
L507736 +++$+++ u2774 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ KENT +++$+++ Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
L507735 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Obviously, this can't last.  She's going to dump him.  Viktor won't be able to take that.  He's too sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
L507734 +++$+++ u2774 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ KENT +++$+++ Why?
L507733 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I can't believe she's doing this -- taking advantage of him this way. It's cruel.
L507097 +++$+++ u2768 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known.
L507096 +++$+++ u2774 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ KENT +++$+++ You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a liability.
L507477 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Please put your clothes on
L507476 +++$+++ u2769 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ "Why are we here?  Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here?  No why.  Just here".
L507475 +++$+++ u2769 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Is that a problem?
L507474 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ You're with me to be close to her?
L507473 +++$+++ u2769 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
L507472 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Simone?
L507471 +++$+++ u2769 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Yes, call me Simone.
L507470 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ What I do to Simone?
L507469 +++$+++ u2769 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Do what you do to Simone.
L507468 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ What?... What did you say?
L507465 +++$+++ u2769 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
L507464 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
L507463 +++$+++ u2769 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ ... so much like her?
L507462 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ You look so, so...
L507461 +++$+++ u2769 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Of course.
L507460 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er...  ... scent.
L507459 +++$+++ u2769 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky.  How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
L507458 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Thank God for you, Faith.  I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.  You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.
L507980 +++$+++ u2770 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ FRANK BRAND +++$+++ And what may I ask brought this on?
L507979 +++$+++ u2782 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE +++$+++ That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
L507978 +++$+++ u2770 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ FRANK BRAND +++$+++ We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
L507977 +++$+++ u2782 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE +++$+++ With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much.
L507976 +++$+++ u2782 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE +++$+++ Frank, you know as well as I do, living in a fish bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media...
L507975 +++$+++ u2770 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ FRANK BRAND +++$+++ -- Simone, the question on everyone's mind is simply... "why?"
L507642 +++$+++ u2782 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE +++$+++ I suppose the thing I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
L507641 +++$+++ u2770 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ FRANK BRAND +++$+++ What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
L507640 +++$+++ u2782 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE +++$+++ Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are just an option.
L507639 +++$+++ u2770 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ FRANK BRAND +++$+++ How about the nudity?
L507638 +++$+++ u2782 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE +++$+++ Sure.  Where would you like to start?
L507637 +++$+++ u2770 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ FRANK BRAND +++$+++ Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
L507636 +++$+++ u2782 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE +++$+++ No, I'm okay.
L507627 +++$+++ u2782 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE +++$+++ That's a good question.  As Nietzsche said, "Whenever a man strives long and hard to appear someone else..."
L507626 +++$+++ u2770 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ FRANK BRAND +++$+++ Who are you really?
L507625 +++$+++ u2782 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE +++$+++ Because, you have to understand, Frank, these interviews -- none of this is real.  Who I am on screen and who I really am are two totally different people.
L507624 +++$+++ u2782 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE +++$+++ I'm not even sure I deserve it. After tonight I'll have almost as much screen time on your show as I do in my movies.  How is that healthy for a performer?
L507623 +++$+++ u2770 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ FRANK BRAND +++$+++ You don't secretly want the attention?
L507622 +++$+++ u2782 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE +++$+++ Don't I know it.  That's the only reason I'm here now -- to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
L507621 +++$+++ u2770 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ FRANK BRAND +++$+++ Of course, the only problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract more.
L507620 +++$+++ u2782 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE +++$+++ I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?
L507619 +++$+++ u2770 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ FRANK BRAND +++$+++ Well, no one could accuse you of being over-exposed, Simone.  Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
L507530 +++$+++ u2771 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Simone!
L507529 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ No.  In fact, between us, she doesn't really exist.
L507527 +++$+++ u2771 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ I have to talk to her about my experimental film.  It's very... experimental.
L507526 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ I know what you mean.
L507525 +++$+++ u2771 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
L507520 +++$+++ u2771 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Somebody said she was here.
L507519 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
L507518 +++$+++ u2771 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Is she here?
L507429 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ I can't explain it to you now -- you'll see when it's all put together.  Anyway, we got it a couple of takes ago.  Let's move on.
L507428 +++$+++ u2771 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ How did the wall get there?
L507427 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ -- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
L507426 +++$+++ u2771 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ -- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
L507425 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ There's... a wall between you --
L507424 +++$+++ u2771 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Why not?
L507423 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ You can't.
L507422 +++$+++ u2771 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ But she's right there!  I must feel her!
L507421 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Absolutely not!
L507420 +++$+++ u2771 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
L507419 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Hal, what are you doing?
L507388 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ For you.  I want you to know, Simone appreciates you all working for scale.  But why am I thanking you? Simone can thank you herself.  She insisted on speaking with you before filming begins.  She's on the line now.
L507387 +++$+++ u2771 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ For her?
L507386 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Body double.
L507385 +++$+++ u2771 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ How will you do our love scenes?
L507303 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ You're so far off!  Hal... Hal Sinclair... your co- star.  Remember now?... No, I don't think he's put on weight.  Anyway, you think he's right for "Eternity Forever"?... not the right type?... a different direction...  I'll try to talk her into it.
L507302 +++$+++ u2771 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ It was more in passing.
L507301 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ You'll never guess who I'm with... you ran into him on the lot.
L507299 +++$+++ u2771 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ I'm sure she's meeting with a lot of people right now.  She is just as you described her, Viktor... indescribable.  I strongly sensed she thought I was right for it.
L507298 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Really?  She didn't mention it.
L507297 +++$+++ u2771 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
L507296 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Clyde.
L507295 +++$+++ u2771 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
L507294 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ You never were together, Hal.
L507293 +++$+++ u2771 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
L507292 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Hello, Hal.
L507291 +++$+++ u2771 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
L507047 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not bigger than this picture.
L507046 +++$+++ u2771 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.
L507135 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ I'm already dead.
L507134 +++$+++ u2772 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
L507133 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
L507132 +++$+++ u2772 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
L507131 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ You saw that?
L507130 +++$+++ u2772 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ "Straw God" changed my life.
L507129 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ You do?
L507128 +++$+++ u2772 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
L507127 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ What's that?
L507126 +++$+++ u2772 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ That's why you're so perfect.  You have something I don't have.
L507125 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ I don't know anything about computers.
L507124 +++$+++ u2772 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ It can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together.
L507123 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
L507122 +++$+++ u2772 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ You already do.  But my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer.  The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years.
L507121 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ -- a living, breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake.
L507120 +++$+++ u2772 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ -- Flesh is weak.
L507119 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ I need flesh and --
L507118 +++$+++ u2772 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ -- We call them "vactors".
L507117 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
L507116 +++$+++ u2772 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ Not like this --
L507115 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ I've seen them all before.
L507114 +++$+++ u2772 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ You have to see her.
L507113 +++$+++ u2772 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ Don't be.  It was worth it.
L507112 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L507111 +++$+++ u2772 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ Good and bad.  They think that's what caused this.  Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen.  It's the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy too.
L507110 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Good for you, Hank.
L507109 +++$+++ u2772 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ -- Eight years ago.  In that whole time, I never left my computer.
L507108 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
L507107 +++$+++ u2772 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
L507106 +++$+++ u2772 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ I have your new leading lady...  ... right here in my pants.
L507105 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ I was misquoted.
L507104 +++$+++ u2772 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
L507103 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ You want me to call Security?
L507102 +++$+++ u2772 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
L507101 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ -- Please, get away from me.
L507100 +++$+++ u2772 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ -- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky... thank God.  I've been trying to see you, calling -- Your assistant wouldn't put me through.  I told her it was a matter of life and death.  I was afraid I wouldn't get to you in time --
L507515 +++$+++ u2773 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I can't believe you people!  No wonder she never comes to these things!
L507514 +++$+++ u2780 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ PREMIERE REPORTER 2 +++$+++ Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
L507513 +++$+++ u2773 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
L507512 +++$+++ u2780 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ PREMIERE REPORTER 2 +++$+++ There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
L507511 +++$+++ u2773 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
L507510 +++$+++ u2780 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ PREMIERE REPORTER 2 +++$+++ Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a minute?  What brings you here tonight?
L507972 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ Your mistake wasn't making something fake, daddy.  We're fine with fake -- as long as you don't lie about it.
L507971 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Me and Simone.  What I did.
L507970 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ About you and mom?
L507820 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Lainey...
L507819 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
L507818 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ No, that was me.
L507817 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
L507816 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
L507815 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ -- I can't accept it.  I don't want a car, Dad.
L507814 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ It's from both of us.  Of course you'll have to drive it around the lot until you get your permit --
L507813 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ I know.  Thank her for me.
L507812 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
L507811 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ It's fantastic -- it's too much.
L507810 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you like it?
L507789 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ She did... didn't she?
L507788 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ Why didn't she thank you?
L507754 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ I love you too, daddy.
L507753 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ I love you, Lainey.
L507751 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ I love her but that doesn't mean I need to meet her.
L507750 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
