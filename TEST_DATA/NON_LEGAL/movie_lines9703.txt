L140357 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
L140356 +++$+++ u4577 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Lay it on me.
L140355 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Of course.
L140354 +++$+++ u4577 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ One more thing.  If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry.
L140351 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
L140350 +++$+++ u4577 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ How do I know you'll keep your word?
L140349 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Jazz question.  What other kind is there?  You get it right, we roll with it.  You disappear.  Tonight.  You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
L140348 +++$+++ u4577 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ What kind of question?
L140343 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ I am a nice guy, Daniel.  With a job to do.  You know how it is.
L140342 +++$+++ u4577 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.
L140341 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ 'Fraid so.
L140340 +++$+++ u4577 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ You know Dmitri?
L140338 +++$+++ u4577 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ The crowd was most kind.  I was born in 1945, but my life began the night of July 22, 1964.  That was the moment of my conception.  Right here in this very room.
L140337 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ The crowd had to dig it.
L140336 +++$+++ u4577 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Most vividly.  "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..."  ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
L140335 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Remember what you played?
L140332 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Unbelievable...  ...you hearing this?  Unbelievable.
L140331 +++$+++ u4577 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
L140330 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Get outta here!  You and Louis?
L140329 +++$+++ u4577 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Oh, my, yes.
L140328 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ No.
L140327 +++$+++ u4577 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Did better'n that.
L140326 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
L140325 +++$+++ u4577 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  Louis was playing.  God was smiling.
L140324 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Was it great?  Better than great, it had to be...
L140323 +++$+++ u4577 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
L140322 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Jesus...
L140321 +++$+++ u4577 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Right through those doors.  The man himself.
L140320 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ You're kidding me.
L140319 +++$+++ u4577 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ ...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place.  Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point.  Being around the music, that was the thing.  And I was.  Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in?  Mr. Louis Armstrong.
L140576 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ By the way.  Daniel said he was sorry.
L140575 +++$+++ u4578 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Very generous.
L140574 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
L140573 +++$+++ u4578 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Twenty five?
L140572 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ As a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight.  Twenty five percent.
L140571 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Wouldn't dream of it.
L140570 +++$+++ u4578 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Vincent.  Do not cross me.
L140563 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ In fifteen years, I have never left a customer unsatisfied.
L140562 +++$+++ u4578 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Can you finish on schedule?
L140561 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.
L140560 +++$+++ u4578 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
L140559 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You think I wanted to come here tonight?  You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it.
L140558 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You tell me.  I had to toss the list in the river.  I was protecting your sorry, long-winded ass.  So why don't you show a little courtesy?
L140557 +++$+++ u4578 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Federal?
L140556 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I picked up a tail.
L140555 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I said.  Get the gun.  Out.  Of my fucking <u>face.</u> Before I wrap it in a blintz and feed it to you.
L140554 +++$+++ u4578 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ What?  What did you say?
L140553 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
L140552 +++$+++ u4578 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ What?
L140551 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I think...
L140550 +++$+++ u4578 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Tell me Vincent.  Tell me what you think.
L140548 +++$+++ u4578 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Neither do I.  But my children, they're still young.  Do you know who they like even more than jolly old Saint Nicholas?  His helper, Black Peter. An old Russian fairy tale tells of how Santa got so busy looking after all the good kids, he had to hire a helper to punish all the bad kids.  That was Black Peter's job.  He was given the list of all the bad children, and he would visit them in their homes late at night.  And if he caught them not saying their prayers, he would leave a bundle of wooden switches outside their door.  That was a warning.  If they continued to misbehave, he would swoop down and take the children away. And they would never be seen again.
L140547 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Can't say that I do.
L140546 +++$+++ u4578 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Tell me, Vincent.  Do you believe in Santa Claus?
L140545 +++$+++ u4578 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Sorry?
L140544 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L140543 +++$+++ u4578 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ I see.  That was an important list, wouldn't you say?  The people on that list are being subpoenaed tomorrow by a federal judge.  And you "lost" it?
L140597 +++$+++ u4586 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ PEDROSA +++$+++ Take him down.  Save Richard Yip, our witness...
L140596 +++$+++ u4579 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ HELLER +++$+++ What are you gonna do?
L140593 +++$+++ u4579 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ HELLER +++$+++ I don't know...
L140592 +++$+++ u4586 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ PEDROSA +++$+++ Lemme tell you something.  Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  Nobody even know what he looked like until now...
L140590 +++$+++ u4586 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ PEDROSA +++$+++ No.  Your cabbie is floating down a storm drain or stuffed in the trunk of a cab.
L140589 +++$+++ u4579 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ HELLER +++$+++ ...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo.  That guy?  That guy is a cabbie.  And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?
L140588 +++$+++ u4586 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ PEDROSA +++$+++ So?
L140587 +++$+++ u4579 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ HELLER +++$+++ ...got off the phone with his dispatcher.  What an asshole. Cabbie's name is Max Rilke, been driving that cab for ten years...
L140581 +++$+++ u4579 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ HELLER +++$+++ Can you fax me his picture?  His license or something?  What do you mean you don't have that there?  Anybody else in the cab?
L140580 +++$+++ u4586 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ PEDROSA +++$+++ Advance team, two men, stick to that goddamn cab, stay in radio contact, the rest of us follow in the van. Nobody moves until the entire team's in place...
L140565 +++$+++ u4579 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ HELLER +++$+++ ...Petrov and Cicerno for sure...
L140564 +++$+++ u4586 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ PEDROSA +++$+++ ...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight...
L140530 +++$+++ u4586 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ PEDROSA +++$+++ Pretty quiet down there.  A cab just pulled up, aside from that...
L140529 +++$+++ u4579 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ HELLER +++$+++ Something going on?
L140601 +++$+++ u4585 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ This isn't our goddamn game!
L140600 +++$+++ u4579 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ HELLER +++$+++ ...if they're wrong?!
L140599 +++$+++ u4585 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ Not our call, Phil.
L140598 +++$+++ u4579 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ HELLER +++$+++ What if they're wrong?
L140525 +++$+++ u4579 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ HELLER +++$+++ Detective Sergeant Phil Heller.
L140524 +++$+++ u4585 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ Captain Walt Muldoon, NYPD.
L140467 +++$+++ u4585 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ Pick me up in five minutes.
L140466 +++$+++ u4579 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ HELLER +++$+++ Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
L140465 +++$+++ u4585 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ Jesus.  Two in one night?
L140464 +++$+++ u4579 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ HELLER +++$+++ Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.
L140463 +++$+++ u4585 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ Elvis?
L140462 +++$+++ u4579 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ HELLER +++$+++ ...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
L140306 +++$+++ u4579 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ HELLER +++$+++ Cabbie had no criminal record, no history of mental illness.  Suddenly, he just wigs out and pops three people, then himself?  Plus the victims weren't random solid citizens. They were all lowlives.  Wiseguys.  I've always wondered if there was someone else in the cab.
L140305 +++$+++ u4585 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ Oh?
L140304 +++$+++ u4579 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ HELLER +++$+++ I never bought that.
L140303 +++$+++ u4585 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ So?  It was a random thing.
L140302 +++$+++ u4579 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ HELLER +++$+++ They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
L140301 +++$+++ u4585 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
L140300 +++$+++ u4579 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ HELLER +++$+++ Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.
L140299 +++$+++ u4585 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ What thing?
L140298 +++$+++ u4579 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ HELLER +++$+++ Remember that thing a few years back? That thing with the cab?
L140290 +++$+++ u4585 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ He could'a been depressed.  It still doesn't tell me homicide.
L140289 +++$+++ u4579 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ HELLER +++$+++ There was a car here, you can see where the glass came down all around it.  Ivan flew out the window and went bam.
L140285 +++$+++ u4585 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ What homicide?  Phil.  Where's a body? Look.  All we got is glass...
L140284 +++$+++ u4579 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ HELLER +++$+++ Oh, we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
L140283 +++$+++ u4585 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ Dmitri <u>Gusunov?</u> What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him.  They're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...
L140282 +++$+++ u4579 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ HELLER +++$+++ Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
L140281 +++$+++ u4585 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ You guys been holding hands?
L140280 +++$+++ u4579 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ HELLER +++$+++ Ivan Petrov.  Supposed to meet me for dinner, never shows up.  I come here, find this.
L140279 +++$+++ u4585 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ ...this snitch of yours, what's his name, Ivan?
L140444 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Of course!
L140443 +++$+++ u4580 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ IDA +++$+++ Try?
L140442 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ I'm in town for a short time.
L140439 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Vincent...
L140438 +++$+++ u4580 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ IDA +++$+++ What's your name?
L140437 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Quite an achievement...
L140433 +++$+++ u4580 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ IDA +++$+++ Of course I'm proud.  You know he started with nothing?  Look at him today.  Playing concerts.
L140432 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ I'm sure you're very proud of Max.
L140427 +++$+++ u4580 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ IDA +++$+++ Max never had many friends.  So much with the piano.  Always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...
L140426 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Client?  I like to think of myself as more of a friend.  A mentor.
L140424 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Tell me about it.
L140423 +++$+++ u4580 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ IDA +++$+++ Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
L140422 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ It's nothing.
L140421 +++$+++ u4580 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ IDA +++$+++ And you came all the way down here to see me?
L140420 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ I was with Max when he got the call.
L140419 +++$+++ u4580 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ IDA +++$+++ Oh, call me Ida.  To what do we owe the pleasure?
L140418 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Happy to meet you, Mrs. Rilke.
L140415 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ No harm done, ma'am.
L140414 +++$+++ u4580 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ IDA +++$+++ Why didn't you tell me we had company?  And what's your name?
L140441 +++$+++ u4580 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ IDA +++$+++ Vincent.  It was nice to meet you. Visit again?
L140440 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I came to see you, you look fine.  We gotta go.
L140431 +++$+++ u4580 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ IDA +++$+++ Yesss, you are.  He's artistic.
L140430 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm standing right here.
L140429 +++$+++ u4580 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ IDA +++$+++ What's he sayin'?
L140428 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm...in...the...room, here.  Don't talk about me like I'm not in the room.
L140417 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Mom, Vincent.  Vincent, my mother, Ida Rilke.
L140416 +++$+++ u4580 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ IDA +++$+++ You paid for my flowers?  They're beautiful.  Max, you gonna introduce us?
L140413 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ He paid for 'em.
L140412 +++$+++ u4580 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ IDA +++$+++ By worrying about you spending money on foolish things?  So I can watch them wilt?
L140411 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You're gonna cheer up.
L140410 +++$+++ u4580 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ IDA +++$+++ What am I gonna do with flowers?
L140409 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I brought you flowers.
L140408 +++$+++ u4580 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ IDA +++$+++ You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
L140407 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I got caught up at work.
L140406 +++$+++ u4580 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ IDA +++$+++ I've been calling and calling.
L140405 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Hi, Ma.

L140257 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ <u>My hands are taped to the fucking </u> <u>steering wheel!</u>
L140256 +++$+++ u4581 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ KID #1 +++$+++ I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
L140255 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You're kidding me.
L140251 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I got my, my hands taped to the steering wheel here, there's this guy, he taped me in the car, he's back there somewhere.
L140250 +++$+++ u4581 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ KID #1 +++$+++ Yo, whassup?
L140249 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Oh.  Oh, thank God, hey!  Hey, guys, hey, help me out here!
L140384 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Hang on.  Carefully...
L140383 +++$+++ u4582 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Nothin'!  Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow!  Get him on the line, please.
L140382 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
L140381 +++$+++ u4582 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
L140380 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...
L140379 +++$+++ u4582 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Who is this?
L140378 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ You hassling my driver again?
L140377 +++$+++ u4582 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Maaaaaax!
L140376 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Jesus, what is with this guy?
L140375 +++$+++ u4582 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit.
L140240 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Tell it to Max.  Tell him he's an asshole.
L140239 +++$+++ u4582 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I was just tryin' to...to...
L140238 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
L140237 +++$+++ u4582 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Let's not get excited, sir.
L140236 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Vincent <u>Farrell</u>, Assistant U.S. Attorney.  A passenger in this taxicab, and I'm reporting you to the DMV...
L140235 +++$+++ u4582 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Who the hell is this?
L140234 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ He's not paying you one cent!
L140215 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ What happens if you don't?
L140214 +++$+++ u4582 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I know you're out there!  Answer the goddamn call!
L140386 +++$+++ u4582 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Where you been the last two hours? Your mother's been calling every ten minutes whining about how you didn't show up.
L140385 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yeah?
L140224 +++$+++ u4582 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I give a shit whose fault it was, you're payin'!
L140223 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ It got crashed!  I didn't...
L140222 +++$+++ u4582 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ <u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
L140221 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yeah?  So?
L140220 +++$+++ u4582 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I just got off the phone with the cops.  They called to check you brought the cab in...
L140219 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Uh, yeah?  Lenny?  It's me.
L140217 +++$+++ u4582 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Max!  Dammit!  <u>Answer!</u>
L140216 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ He'll keep calling.
L139962 +++$+++ u4588 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ ...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...
L139961 +++$+++ u4583 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ ...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
L139960 +++$+++ u4588 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ ...oh, bullshit!  He was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing...
L139959 +++$+++ u4583 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ ...I'm sorry, I don't see it that way...
L139958 +++$+++ u4588 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ ...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
L139957 +++$+++ u4583 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ ...why is everything always about you...
L140733 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Let her go.
L140732 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Max?
L140684 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
L140683 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Well.  That was brilliant.
L140681 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Vincent?
L140680 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Slow down!
L140679 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass.
L140678 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Slow the hell down!
L140675 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ But you know what?  Nothing matters, anyway.  We are insignificant out here in the big nowhere, say the badass sociopath in my backseat.  Right? Yeah.  That's one thing I've got to thank you for, bro.  And I never saw it that way...
L140674 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ You're going too fast.
L140673 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I should have done that.  Fixed it and more.  Get out from under what I been under...
L140672 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Slow down.
L140671 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ 'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves...
L140669 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ ...pie in the sky?  "Someday my dream'll come..."  But one night you'll wake up and realize suddenly you're old.  It hasn't happened.  It never will.  Life just flipped on you.  Tomorrow became yesterday.  Then you'll bullshit yourself it was never gonna happen, anyway, and push it back in memory...and anesthetize yourself in a Barcalounger with daytime TV for the rest of your life...  Don't talk to me about murder.  You're <u>do-in</u>' yourself...in this yellow prison with steel-belted radials. Clocking in and out everyday...
L140668 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ None of your business.
L140667 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved?
L140666 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Answer the question.
L140665 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ ...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision...
L140664 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
L140663 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ As in...?
