L82382 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ The monkey.
L82381 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Which one is Elijah again?
L82380 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
L82379 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ What?
L82378 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.  Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?
L82377 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
L82376 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
L82375 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
L82374 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
L82373 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Enjoy.
L82372 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
L82371 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Morning.
L82939 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court!
L82938 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
L82937 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
L82936 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
L82935 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
L82934 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ I know. I'm sorry...
L82933 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ That... was... no... simulation.
L82932 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ So how was it?
L82919 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Let me try!
L82918 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
L82917 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Let me try.
L82916 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Sure, after a fashion.
L82915 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Simulates?
L82914 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.
L82881 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Holy shit! He said what I said!
L82880 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Holy shit! He said what I said!
L82879 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Holy shit, yes!
L82878 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Holy shit, yes!
L82868 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.
L82867 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Maxine...
L82512 +++$+++ u4025 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLORIS +++$+++ I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!
L82511 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid I’m in love with somebody else.
L82497 +++$+++ u4025 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLORIS +++$+++ Music to my ears! Whatever you said. Speak, speak, speak, my magnificent friend, speak!
L82496 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ I am a trained performer.
L82495 +++$+++ u4025 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLORIS +++$+++ You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.
L82414 +++$+++ u4025 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLORIS +++$+++ You suggest what? I have no time for piddling suggestions from mumbling job applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now. I think that's what he said.
L82413 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ I said "yes."
L82412 +++$+++ u4025 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLORIS +++$+++ Yex?
L82411 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Yes?
L82410 +++$+++ u4025 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLORIS +++$+++ Mr. Juarez?
L82408 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Forget it.
L82407 +++$+++ u4025 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLORIS +++$+++ Money, Miss Warts?
L82406 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ My name is Schwartz.
L82405 +++$+++ u4025 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLORIS +++$+++ I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
L82404 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Schwartz.
L82403 +++$+++ u4025 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLORIS +++$+++ Pardon?
L82402 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Schwartz.
L82401 +++$+++ u4025 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLORIS +++$+++ Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
L82400 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
L82399 +++$+++ u4025 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLORIS +++$+++ Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs?
L82776 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ I am not alone. There are others. We are legion. You will pay for this blasphemy. You will pay dearly.
L82775 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ You're insane.
L82774 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
L82773 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
L82772 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
L82686 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain “doors” which should never be opened.
L82685 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually.  In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
L82684 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
L82683 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
L82682 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
L82681 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
L82680 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
L82679 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Dr. Lester...
L82600 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Thank you, sir.
L82599 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
L82598 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and....
L82597 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see.  Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.
L82596 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Dr. Lester. . .
L82544 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.
L82543 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
L82542 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Yessir.
L82541 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
L82540 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
L82539 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. “Ladies,” I begin. “I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
L82521 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ All right. Meet me at the Juicy-Juice Juice Bar after work today and I'll spill my goddamn guts for you.
L82520 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
L82519 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
L82518 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
L82517 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
L82516 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ I'll keep that in mind, sir.
L82515 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
L82514 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
L82513 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.
L82438 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you.  But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.
L82437 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Just one. Why is this floor so short?
L82436 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
L82435 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ No. I understand perfectly.
L82434 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think.  I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
L82433 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ No.
L82432 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."
L82431 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester.
L82425 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Damn, you are good. I tried to trick you. Okay, put these in order.
L82424 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Glooph is not a letter, sir.
L82423 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
L82422 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
L82421 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
L82420 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
L82419 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what you’re implying.
L82418 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
L82417 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Security.
L82416 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
L82415 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
L82955 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
L82954 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
L82924 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
L82923 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
L82921 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
L82920 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Let him try.
L82883 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
L82882 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Lotte? Is that you?
L82877 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
L82876 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Lotte, this is so good...
L82870 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution.
L82869 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ You're glowing again.
L82838 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig.
L82837 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ You're evil, Maxine.
L82836 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
L82835 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
L82834 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ I've fallen in love.
L82833 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Are you torturing me on purpose?
L82832 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ You're late.
L82771 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
L82770 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
L82750 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ My God.
L82749 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
L82689 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.
L82688 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Okay. Here it is.  Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.
L82651 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ I'll protect you, Dollface.
L82650 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
L82649 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Sure. It'd be fun.
L82648 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ You wanted to be partners with me?
L82647 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
L82646 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
L82645 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
L82644 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Tickets to Malkovich?
L82643 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Good. We'll sell tickets.
L82642 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
L82641 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
L82640 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
L82639 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ What's he been in?
L82638 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
L82637 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
L82636 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
L82635 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ It better be.
L82634 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ This is important!
L82633 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ No.
L82632 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Don't you want to know what happened to me?
L82592 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
L82591 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.
L82590 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Please, let me explain.
L82589 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Yikes.
L82588 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...
L82587 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
L82586 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Hi.
L82567 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Well, I'm a puppeteer...
L82566 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy.
L82565 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Good. Now we're getting somewhere.  Not a chance.
L82564 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ No, wait! I like your tits.  I love your tits. I want to fuck you.
L82563 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
L82562 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ I mean, I am really attracted to you.
L82561 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ You're a fag or a liar.
L82560 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ I’m not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male.
L82558 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Don’t let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
