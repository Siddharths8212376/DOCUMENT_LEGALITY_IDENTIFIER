L575602 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Mm.
L575601 +++$+++ u8149 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DORIS +++$+++ *That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
L575600 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So?
L575599 +++$+++ u8149 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DORIS +++$+++ ...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.
L575598 +++$+++ u8149 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DORIS +++$+++ Ahh...
L575597 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ How's that?
L575596 +++$+++ u8149 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DORIS +++$+++ Dave.
L575595 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Who?
L575594 +++$+++ u8149 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DORIS +++$+++ ...What a knucklehead.
L575534 +++$+++ u8149 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DORIS +++$+++ Oh, don't be a grump.
L575533 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
L575532 +++$+++ u8149 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DORIS +++$+++ Come on, get ready. It's important.
L575531 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah, right.
L575530 +++$+++ u8149 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DORIS +++$+++ Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
L575529 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Where you going?
L575474 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Mm.
L575473 +++$+++ u8149 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DORIS +++$+++ Honey?
L575472 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money?
L576154 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...Well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. There was nothing left to mortgage; Riedenschneider went home and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway...
L576153 +++$+++ u8155 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ RIEDENSCHNEIDER +++$+++ ...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women...
L576147 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...He told them to look at me--look at me close. That the closer they looked the less sense it would all make, that I wasn't the kind of guy to kill a guy, that I was the barber, for Christ's sake...
L576146 +++$+++ u8155 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ RIEDENSCHNEIDER +++$+++ ...who among us is in a position to say...
L576145 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
L576144 +++$+++ u8155 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ RIEDENSCHNEIDER +++$+++ ...a puny player on the great world's stage...
L576143 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe...
L576135 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I tried to tell him the whole story, but Riedenschneider stopped me. He said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of Big Dave...
L576134 +++$+++ u8155 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ RIEDENSCHNEIDER +++$+++ Not guilty, your honor...
L575916 +++$+++ u8155 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ RIEDENSCHNEIDER +++$+++ Who? *Who?!* I don't know who! But the point is that if Mr Prosecutor over there had devoted half the time he's spent persecuting *this* woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoe's past, then we might *know* who! But we can't *know* what really happened! Because of Fritz, or Werner, or whatever the hell his name is! And because Me Prosecutor is *also* a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch who decided it's easier to victimize your wife! Because it's easier *not* to look! Because the more you look, the less you know! But the beauty of it is, we don't *gotta* know! We just gotta show that, goddamnit, *they* don't know. Reasonable doubt. Science. The atom. *You* explain it to me. Go ahead. Try.
L575915 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So... who... who actually--
L575914 +++$+++ u8155 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ RIEDENSCHNEIDER +++$+++ ...Did Big Dave mention that it was something about his war service? I don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; I'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to *you* to help him out of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch!
L575913 +++$+++ u8155 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ RIEDENSCHNEIDER +++$+++ And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money...
L575912 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah.
L575911 +++$+++ u8155 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ RIEDENSCHNEIDER +++$+++ Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.
L575910 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...I don't get it.
L575872 +++$+++ u8155 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ RIEDENSCHNEIDER +++$+++ Will anyone corroborate and goddamn part of your story at all?
L575871 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...I don't think so.
L575870 +++$+++ u8155 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ RIEDENSCHNEIDER +++$+++ Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?
L575869 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I took Doris's keys.
L575868 +++$+++ u8155 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ RIEDENSCHNEIDER +++$+++ How did you get into the store?
L575867 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I don't know. I don't think so.
L575866 +++$+++ u8155 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ RIEDENSCHNEIDER +++$+++ Will anyone else say they knew?
L575865 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I... just knew. A husband knows.
L575864 +++$+++ u8155 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ RIEDENSCHNEIDER +++$+++ OK, how did you know?
L575863 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ He and Doris... were having an affair.
L575862 +++$+++ u8155 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ RIEDENSCHNEIDER +++$+++ OK, we forget the blackmail. *You* killed him. How come?
L575859 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ *I* was with her.
L575858 +++$+++ u8155 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ RIEDENSCHNEIDER +++$+++ --don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.
L575857 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It was Big Dave's.
L575856 +++$+++ u8155 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ RIEDENSCHNEIDER +++$+++ ...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive. They got a murder scene *you* had access to. That's Opportunity. They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* weapon--
L575855 +++$+++ u8155 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ RIEDENSCHNEIDER +++$+++ Terrific. Your husband backs you up. That's terrific.
L575854 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I knew about it. Big Dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money.
L575824 +++$+++ u8155 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ RIEDENSCHNEIDER +++$+++ Good! Any questions give me a ring-- Turandot suite; if I'm out leave a message. You sure you don't want anything? No?
L575823 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...OK.
L575822 +++$+++ u8155 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ RIEDENSCHNEIDER +++$+++ Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?
L575821 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
L575820 +++$+++ u8155 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ RIEDENSCHNEIDER +++$+++ Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? *You* don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed?
L576015 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Sure, Walter. Thanks.
L576014 +++$+++ u8156 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.
L576013 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah.
L576012 +++$+++ u8156 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.
L576011 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
L576010 +++$+++ u8156 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Ed, how're you holding up?
L575763 +++$+++ u8156 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Yeah, the best.
L575762 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
L575761 +++$+++ u8156 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.
L575760 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
L575759 +++$+++ u8156 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ ...Probity.
L575758 +++$+++ u8156 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here.
L575757 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...So, uh, who should I--
L575754 +++$+++ u8156 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ No thanks, honey.
L575753 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'm fine. Thanks.
L575752 +++$+++ u8156 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Coffee, Ed?
L575746 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So, who should I--
L575745 +++$+++ u8156 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Taking it seriously.
L575744 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So--
L575743 +++$+++ u8156 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...
L575742 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ He a good man?
L575741 +++$+++ u8156 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ 'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender.
L575740 +++$+++ u8156 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless.
L575739 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah. What do I, uh...
L575738 +++$+++ u8156 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ OK. Boy. Jesus!
L575737 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'm fine.
L575736 +++$+++ u8156 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Sure you don't need one?
L575735 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No thanks.
L575734 +++$+++ u8156 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Oh, hell. Drink?
L575733 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.
L575543 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L575542 +++$+++ u8157 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
L575541 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah.
L575540 +++$+++ u8157 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
L575539 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I don't work here. My wife does.
L575538 +++$+++ u8157 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
L575537 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...Huh?
L575589 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Sorry, I just didn't remember.
L575588 +++$+++ u8158 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ YOUNG WOMAN +++$+++ ...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
L575586 +++$+++ u8158 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ YOUNG WOMAN +++$+++ I know who you are, Mr Crane.
L575585 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
L575584 +++$+++ u8158 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ YOUNG WOMAN +++$+++ He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
L575583 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ That was quite something.
L575582 +++$+++ u8158 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ YOUNG WOMAN +++$+++ Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven.
L575581 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...Did you make that up?
L575795 +++$+++ u8151 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ They too use the toilet, Ed. In spite of appearances. And their money will be secured by the barbershop. A rock. A *rock*, the barbershop. I mean, how long has *this* place been here?
L575794 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L575793 +++$+++ u8151 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.
L575792 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L575791 +++$+++ u8151 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that.
L575790 +++$+++ u8151 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ The hell with it, Eddie!
L575789 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ That's very generous.
L575788 +++$+++ u8151 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
L575787 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
L575786 +++$+++ u8151 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches!
L575785 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah.
L575784 +++$+++ u8151 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!
L575700 +++$+++ u8151 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Damn, I got a headache to beat the band.
L575699 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...Nah.
L575698 +++$+++ u8151 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You don't got a headache?
L575697 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ OK.
L575696 +++$+++ u8151 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ ...How you today, Ed?
L575525 +++$+++ u8151 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What the hell are you talking about?
L575524 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
L575523 +++$+++ u8151 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What the--
L575522 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.
L575520 +++$+++ u8151 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid.
L575519 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.
L575518 +++$+++ u8151 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?
L575517 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing.
L575516 +++$+++ u8151 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Whuddya mean?
L575515 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...You ever wonder about it?
L575514 +++$+++ u8151 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yeah.
L575513 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ This hair.
L575512 +++$+++ u8151 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Huh?
L575511 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Frank.
L575454 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah, yeah--go home.
L575453 +++$+++ u8151 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ ...You sure, Eddie?
L575446 +++$+++ u8151 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Sure, go to the store. Go there, describe to the man where you will be fishing, and for what, and the weather conditions, sun, no sun, whatnot, and so forth, and then you might as well have the man go ahead and sell you the goddamn FISH, Ed...
L575445 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah.
L575444 +++$+++ u8151 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?
L575443 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L575442 +++$+++ u8151 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
L575441 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L575440 +++$+++ u8151 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ ...so you tie your own flies, Ed. I mean, if you're really serious. You tie your own flies, you do a--I know it's matickless, I know, people say, hey, you can buy flies at the store-- but you can buy your fish at the store, Ed, you see what I'm saying?
L575397 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...
L575396 +++$+++ u8151 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Jesus...
L575395 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah.
L575394 +++$+++ u8151 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Russians exploded an A-bomb.
L575393 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Huh?
L575392 +++$+++ u8151 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ ...Ed?
L575391 +++$+++ u8151 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ How d'ya like them apples?
L575390 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L575389 +++$+++ u8151 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Says here that the Russians exploded n A-bomb and there's not a damn thing we can do about it.
L576117 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Birdy...
L576116 +++$+++ u8152 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ KREBS +++$+++ What'd he say?
L576115 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Birdy... I didn't mean to--
L575725 +++$+++ u8152 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ KREBS +++$+++ He's the dead guy.
L575724 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I don't understand.
L575720 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ My *wife*?
L575719 +++$+++ u8152 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ KREBS +++$+++ They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail.
L575718 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Huh?
L575713 +++$+++ u8152 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ KREBS +++$+++ Huh? No.
L575712 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...We goin'?
