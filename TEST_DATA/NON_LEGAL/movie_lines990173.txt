L423139 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ So not over her, in fact.
L423138 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Oh God no.
L423137 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Which means you won't be distracted by the fact that she's back in London, grasping her Oscar, and to be found filming most days on Hampstead Heath.
L423136 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ No, don't think I do.
L423135 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
L423134 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I believe I have.
L423133 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ So -- you've laid the ghost.
L423131 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
L423130 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
L423129 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
L423128 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Any more announcements?
L423122 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Is it someone we know?
L423121 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.
L422932 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ No really, one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say Indiana Jones -- and the other, who seriously ought to have known better, casually marries my best friend.
L422931 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ That's not fair.
L422930 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.
L422928 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ She's perfect, perfect.
L422927 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Well?
L422900 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Really?
L422899 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
L422898 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Buggered?
L422897 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
L422896 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine.
L422895 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ No -- did you?
L422894 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
L422746 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I think you do, yes.
L422745 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ So I get the brownie?
L422705 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You see -- it means 'yes.'
L422704 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Definitely no comment.
L422703 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Do you ever masturbate?
L422702 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ No, it doesn't.
L422701 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ 'No comment' means 'yes.'
L422700 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
L422699 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You haven't slept with her, have you?
L422681 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
L422680 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Max.  This is Anna.
L423272 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.
L423271 +++$+++ u6907 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ RITZ MAN +++$+++ No, sir.
L423270 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
L423269 +++$+++ u6907 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ RITZ MAN +++$+++ No, sir.
L423268 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ How about Miss Flintstone?
L423267 +++$+++ u6907 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ RITZ MAN +++$+++ No, sir.
L422553 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember...
L422552 +++$+++ u6907 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ RITZ MAN +++$+++ Yes, sir.  I have him in my mind.
L422551 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ No, that's right -- I know that.  She said she's using another name -- but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate, which was a serious mistake.
L422550 +++$+++ u6907 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ RITZ MAN +++$+++ I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
L422549 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
L422548 +++$+++ u6907 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ RITZ MAN +++$+++ May I help you, sir?
L422547 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Hello.
L423146 +++$+++ u6908 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SECURITY +++$+++ ... can't let you through.
L423145 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
L423144 +++$+++ u6908 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SECURITY +++$+++ I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
L423143 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ No, no.  She doesn't.
L423142 +++$+++ u6908 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SECURITY +++$+++ Does she know you're coming?
L423141 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
L423140 +++$+++ u6908 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SECURITY +++$+++ Can I help you?
L423181 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Let me help.  We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives.
L423180 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Right -- let's talk about rent...
L423179 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
L423178 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I'm going to throw out these old videos.
L423177 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ What's going on?
L423103 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Right.
L423102 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
L423101 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Was it you?
L423094 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Well, there are.  And we don't need to go anywhere near that far.  My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective.
L423093 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan.
L423079 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry.
L423078 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
L423069 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Just take my work for it.
L423068 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Why not?
L423067 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I wouldn't go outside.
L423030 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
L423029 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I'll talk to you in the morning.
L423028 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ No -- you're right.
L423027 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Spike!
L423026 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
L423025 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
L423024 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
L423023 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Yes.
L423022 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ And you get on very well.
L423021 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Yes.
L423020 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ And she's in your house.
L423019 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Maybe.
L423018 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
L423017 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Spike.
L423016 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Hello.  I wonder if I could have a little word.
L423015 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Oh my God...  Hello.
L422995 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.
L422994 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?
L422891 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ She's someone I just can't -- someone who... self-evidently can't be mine -- and it's as if I've taken love-heroin -- and now I can't even have it again. I've opened Pandora's box.  And there's trouble inside.
L422890 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
L422889 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Well, okay.  There's this girl...
L422815 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Sort of.
L422814 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ You're welcome.  Did you find them?
L422813 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
L422812 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Oh shit, is that the time?  I have to go.
L422811 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
L422810 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
L422809 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ No, 'fraid not.
L422808 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have you seen my glasses?
L422557 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
L422556 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
L422555 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ What?
L422554 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Try 'Flintstone.'
L422546 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one name's bad enough...
L422545 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Which was?
L422544 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
L422543 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ What did she say?
L422541 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Absolutely not.
L422540 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Right.  No one else?
L422539 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
L422538 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
L422537 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ You want me to write down all your messages?
L422536 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Two?  That's it?
L422535 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
L422534 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ So -- any messages?
L422533 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
L422532 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
L422531 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ There's something wrong with the goggles though...
L422530 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
L422529 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
L422528 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
L422527 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
L422526 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Hi...
L422525 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Hey.
L422517 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Yes, she is fairly fabulous.
L422516 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.
L422510 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Well, there you go.  On for a video fest tonight?  I've got some absolute classic.
L422509 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
L422508 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ There's something wrong with this yogurt.
L422404 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Good luck.
L422403 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
L422402 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
L422401 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Wouldn't want that...  Okay -- just one more.
L422400 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
L422399 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Cool, huh?
L422397 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Point taken.
L422396 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.
L422395 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Well... wait for it...  First there's this one...
L422394 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ What are the choices?
L422393 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
L422392 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
L422391 +++$+++ u6909 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ SPIKE +++$+++ Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?
L422623 +++$+++ u6910 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ TARQUIN +++$+++ Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers?
L422622 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Fabulous.
L422621 +++$+++ u6910 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ TARQUIN +++$+++ How was she?
L422587 +++$+++ u6910 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ TARQUIN +++$+++ Oh sure.  Of course.
L422586 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
L422585 +++$+++ u6910 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ TARQUIN +++$+++ I'm sorry.  Which hospital?
L422584 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.
L422573 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Oh.  Right.
L422572 +++$+++ u6910 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ TARQUIN +++$+++ Yes.
L422571 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Are you sure you...?
L422570 +++$+++ u6910 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ TARQUIN +++$+++ Three.
L422569 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Which floor?
L422432 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it.  See you in a sec.
L422431 +++$+++ u6911 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ THIEF +++$+++ Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
L422430 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
L422429 +++$+++ u6911 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ THIEF +++$+++ I haven't got a book down my trousers.
L422428 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ The one down your trousers.
L422427 +++$+++ u6911 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ THIEF +++$+++ What book?
L422426 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
L422425 +++$+++ u6911 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ THIEF +++$+++ So?
L422424 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
L422423 +++$+++ u6911 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ THIEF +++$+++ What?
L422422 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Bad news.
L422421 +++$+++ u6911 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ THIEF +++$+++ Yes.
L422420 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Excuse me.
L429135 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ No. Mister Harding, that is not true.
L429134 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
L429133 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Yes, Mister Harding?
L428460 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...
L428459 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Yes, Mister Harding?
L428275 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...
L428274 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...
L428255 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Have you ever speculated, Mister Harding, that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements?
L428254 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
L428253 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Why?
L428252 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Yes, that is correct.
L428251 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ And yet you suspect her.
L428250 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ No, Miss Ratched...
L428249 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ But you have no proof.
L428248 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
L428247 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Am I to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter?  Mister Harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.
L428233 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ He also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he didn't say how. He has been heard to say to his wife, 'I hate you, I don't ever want to see you again. You've betrayed me.'  So. Does anyone care to touch upon this further?
L428232 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Yes, that's perfectly correct.
L428231 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife...  Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?
