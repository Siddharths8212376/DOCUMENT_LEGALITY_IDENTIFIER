L406331 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.
L406330 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.
L406329 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Oh, my darling.  I'm sorry, too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.
L406328 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.
L406325 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ It's me.
L406324 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Who is it?
L406323 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ In case of a... surprise attack... at night... I am such a... light sleeper... I could wake you... I could scream.
L406322 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
L406321 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ But you will not... be safe...
L406320 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Yes.
L406319 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Separate bedrooms?
L406311 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Goodbye.
L406310 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Five minutes.
L406309 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Yes!!
L406308 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Five minutes.
L406307 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.
L406306 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Will you be joining us, soon?
L406305 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
L406304 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ What are you doing in there?
L406303 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
L406302 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Where is Madame Trillaud?
L406301 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.
L406300 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ I know what you're doing in there.
L406299 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Go away -- I'm busy.
L406298 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Open the door.  It's me.
L406297 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Yes -- what is it?
L406230 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ You are my old friend.
L406229 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ All right -- I promise.
L406228 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
L406227 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Promises mean nothing.
L406226 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Promise.
L406225 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ I don't understand you.
L406224 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
L406223 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ I will never forgive you.
L406222 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Promise me.
L406221 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ I cannot promise you that.
L406220 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Promise me you will never leave me.
L406219 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.
L406218 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ She must have been in love with you.
L406217 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
L406216 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Were any of them married?
L406215 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ One had better legs.
L406214 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Were any of them prettier than I am?
L406213 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Yes.
L406212 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Were they pretty?
L406211 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ No.
L406210 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Were you in love with any of them?
L406209 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Of course.
L406208 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ But you have had mistresses while you were away.
L406207 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ No.
L406206 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ And you, are you in love with any one else?
L406205 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Yes.
L406204 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Do you expect me to believe that?
L406203 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
L406202 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ And now?
L406201 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ I thought I was.  I was confused.
L406200 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Were you in love with him?
L406045 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Oh, you must forgive me, General Bonaparte, I'm afraid you will think me incredibly stupid but I know absolutely nothing about this. Eugene is so independent -- he hardly tells me anything any more, and he has so many things in his room, I must confess I wasn't even aware that he had this sword -- you know how boys can be!
L406044 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
L406043 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?
L406040 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Well, I'm sure that you will be just as pleased to have this as he will be.
L406039 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
L406038 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais.  I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon.
L406035 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Yes, of course.  Hortense, darling, will you tell Louise to bring some sherry?
L406034 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
L406033 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
L406032 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
L406031 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ May I offer you a drink?
L406030 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
L406029 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
L406028 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.
L406027 +++$+++ u2239 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte.  One has read so much about you lately.  Please sit down.
L406167 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ I believe so.  I believe Madame Bonaparte was not discreet, in Paris.
L406166 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
L406165 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
L406164 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ Yes, of course.  What do you want?
L406163 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Can you give me a drink, please?
L406162 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
L406161 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ How did you know it was Captain Charles?
L406160 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ Yes.
L406159 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ You mean you heard them making love?
L406158 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ Yes.
L406157 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ You could hear them?
L406155 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Yes?
L406154 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.
L406153 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ How do you know?
L406152 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ I know.
L406151 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ How do you know?
L406150 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ God help me -- yes.
L406149 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Do you know what you're saying?
L406148 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ My God, what do you think?
L406147 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ What was there to tell?
L406146 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ About Hippolyte Charles.
L406145 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ You couldn't face telling me what?
L406144 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ I couldn't face telling you.
L406143 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ You wrote it.
L406142 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ Yes, I wrote it.
L406141 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ What?
L406140 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ I wrote it.
L406139 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Yes.
L406138 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
L406137 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!
L406136 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
L406135 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ What the hell is the matter with you?
L406134 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ You mean about my wife?!  You mean there are some things better left unsaid about Josephine?!
L406133 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ There are some things... better left unsaid.
L406132 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Look, Junot, you aren't going to leave this room until you explain yourself.
L406131 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ Let's just say, he looks after your interests.
L406130 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
L406129 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ That's all I can say.
L406128 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?
L406127 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ Nothing.  That's all I can say.
L406126 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L406125 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
L406124 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Why not?
L406123 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.
L406122 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Certainly.
L406121 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?
L406120 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ All right, thank you.  Please ask him to come here.
L406119 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ He's downstairs -- somewhere.
L406118 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
L406117 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
L406116 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
L406115 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
L406114 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Why did you give it to him?
L406113 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
L406112 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Well, anyway, sorry to call you away from the festivities, but where is the breakdown on serviceable vehicles?  I asked for it yesterday.
L406111 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Yes, I'm sure he's been too busy chasing his whores to be bothered about my wife.
L406110 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ There's probably some explanation.
L406109 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ God damn it, Junot, wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph?
L406104 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Yes, yes, please sit down.  I will be with you in a moment.
L406103 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ I believe you sent for me.
L406086 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it.
L406085 +++$+++ u2240 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ JUNOT +++$+++ No, one cannot simply ignore it.
L406481 +++$+++ u2248 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN +++$+++ If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.
L406480 +++$+++ u2241 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ MAJOR FIDON +++$+++ If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
L406479 +++$+++ u2248 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN +++$+++ Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
L406478 +++$+++ u2241 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ MAJOR FIDON +++$+++ May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
L406477 +++$+++ u2248 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN +++$+++ No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
L406476 +++$+++ u2241 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ MAJOR FIDON +++$+++ Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
L406475 +++$+++ u2248 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN +++$+++ My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
L406474 +++$+++ u2241 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ MAJOR FIDON +++$+++ Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
L406460 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Well, two nice little Swiss boys, who are virgins, decide they will save up their money and go to a bordello.
L406459 +++$+++ u2242 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ MARIE-LOUISE +++$+++ No.
L406458 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Do you know the joke about the two Swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time?
L406457 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Oh, my dearest child -- you must not worry about anything.  I will teach you everything that you must know.
L406456 +++$+++ u2242 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ MARIE-LOUISE +++$+++ Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
L406455 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
L406454 +++$+++ u2242 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ MARIE-LOUISE +++$+++ Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
L406453 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
L406452 +++$+++ u2242 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ MARIE-LOUISE +++$+++ Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
L406451 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
L406450 +++$+++ u2242 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ MARIE-LOUISE +++$+++ I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
L406449 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside.
L406448 +++$+++ u2242 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ MARIE-LOUISE +++$+++ I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
L406447 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
L406446 +++$+++ u2242 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ MARIE-LOUISE +++$+++ You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
L406445 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Of course, my dear.
L406444 +++$+++ u2242 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ MARIE-LOUISE +++$+++ Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
L406443 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Yes, I do -- very much.
L406442 +++$+++ u2242 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ MARIE-LOUISE +++$+++ Do you like music?
L406440 +++$+++ u2242 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ MARIE-LOUISE +++$+++ You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.
L406439 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?
L406437 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.
L406436 +++$+++ u2242 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ MARIE-LOUISE +++$+++ And, where did you see my portrait?
L406434 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Yes, my dearest Marie-Louise, I am your husband.
L406433 +++$+++ u2242 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ MARIE-LOUISE +++$+++ Oh, then you are...
L406432 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Good evening, ladies.  You must forgive me, my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you.
L406408 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
L406407 +++$+++ u2250 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ TALLEYRAND +++$+++ Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
L406406 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ That is a matter of opinion.
L406405 +++$+++ u2250 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ TALLEYRAND +++$+++ I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
L406404 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
L406403 +++$+++ u2250 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ TALLEYRAND +++$+++ And where do you place Alexander?
L406402 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
L406401 +++$+++ u2250 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ TALLEYRAND +++$+++ What I am talking about is moderation.
L406400 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.
L406399 +++$+++ u2250 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ TALLEYRAND +++$+++ Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
L406398 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ We have a treaty with Austria.
L406397 +++$+++ u2250 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ TALLEYRAND +++$+++ England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
L406396 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ I very seriously doubt it.  I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy.  With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse.  More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent and Russia.
L406395 +++$+++ u2250 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ TALLEYRAND +++$+++ Do you think Alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator?
L406394 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ That is correct.
L406393 +++$+++ u2250 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ TALLEYRAND +++$+++ Now, the section headed "Secret Clauses of the Treaty" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade.
L406392 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Yes, he has.
L406391 +++$+++ u2250 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ TALLEYRAND +++$+++ Has Alexander agreed to this?
L406390 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ I did not ask her to go to war against me.
L406389 +++$+++ u2250 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ TALLEYRAND +++$+++ Those are extremely harsh terms.
L406388 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Does she deserve anything better?
L406387 +++$+++ u2250 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ TALLEYRAND +++$+++ Article 46, calls for the virtual dismemberment of Prussia, reducing her population by half and her army to a token force.
L405915 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.
L405914 +++$+++ u2251 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ VARLAC +++$+++ I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.
L405912 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech.  Now, I order you to come down from the cart.
L405911 +++$+++ u2251 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ VARLAC +++$+++ Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.
L405910 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only for you.  Now, will you please come down at once.  You will be taken back to Chalon for trial.
L405909 +++$+++ u2251 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ VARLAC +++$+++ Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
L405908 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
L405907 +++$+++ u2251 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ VARLAC +++$+++ A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor, Citizen Lieutenant.  One does not call it murder to kill such vermin.
L405905 +++$+++ u2251 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ VARLAC +++$+++ Very well, Citizen Lieutenant.  You have come to the right place, for I am Citizen Varlac.
L405904 +++$+++ u2244 +++$+++ m144 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
