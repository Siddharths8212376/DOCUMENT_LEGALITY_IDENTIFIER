L420385 +++$+++ u2328 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
L420384 +++$+++ u2342 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Please!  I'll never let you down again, Mother.  Never.  I promise.
L420383 +++$+++ u2328 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ I expect more from thee, Richard.
L420382 +++$+++ u2342 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please, mama ...
L420381 +++$+++ u2328 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
L420380 +++$+++ u2342 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
L420379 +++$+++ u2328 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
L420378 +++$+++ u2342 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ I don't ... have them.  Mother ... I swear, I ... didn't smoke.
L420377 +++$+++ u2328 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Do not tell a lie, Richard ... The cornsilk cigarette Harold gave thee behind the store this morning.
L420375 +++$+++ u2328 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Harold may have lost touch with his Bible, but thou must never lapse.
L420374 +++$+++ u2342 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Yes, Mother ...
L420373 +++$+++ u2328 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Because Harold tests thy father's will is no reason to admire him.  Let Harold's worldliness be a warning to thee, not an example.
L420372 +++$+++ u2342 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Why me?
L420371 +++$+++ u2328 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Richard ... come with me, would you ...
L420759 +++$+++ u2342 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ You're not gonna quit on me, are you, Harold?
L420758 +++$+++ u2329 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Relax, Dick, it's just me ... The desert's so beautiful, isn't it?  I want to go home, Dick.  Time to go home.
L420757 +++$+++ u2342 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Harold ... can I get you anything?
L420756 +++$+++ u2329 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Mom expects great things from you ...
L420755 +++$+++ u2329 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Go to law school.  Mom and Dad'll be able to afford it now ...
L420754 +++$+++ u2342 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ What ... ?
L420753 +++$+++ u2329 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.
L420369 +++$+++ u2329 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her.  Anything but a talk with her.
L420368 +++$+++ u2342 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Oh, no, Harold.  He doesn't respond well to humor.  Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ...
L420367 +++$+++ u2329 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I said I didn't need a free ride.  I need a suit.
L420366 +++$+++ u2342 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ What'd you say?
L420365 +++$+++ u2329 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
L420364 +++$+++ u2342 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ What'd he say?
L420948 +++$+++ u2330 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HELMS +++$+++ Black Irishman.  Very moving. "Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer / Things fall apart, the center cannot hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world / And everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned / The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity" ... But it ends so beautifully ominous -- "What rough beast, its hours come round at last / Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?" ... Yes, this country stands at such a juncture.
L420947 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ No.
L420946 +++$+++ u2330 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HELMS +++$+++ You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats?  "The Second Coming"?
L420945 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ No.  They make me sick.  They smell like death ... I had two brothers die young.  But let me tell you, there are worse things than death.  There is such a thing as evil.
L420944 +++$+++ u2330 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HELMS +++$+++ Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  Do you appreciate flowers?
L420943 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ I never thought Jack was ready for the presidency.  But I would never, never consider ...  His death was awful, an awful thing for this country.  Do you ever think of death, Mr. Helms?
L420942 +++$+++ u2330 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HELMS +++$+++ So President Kennedy thought.
L420941 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Cuba would be a small price to pay.
L420940 +++$+++ u2330 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HELMS +++$+++ By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
L420939 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.
L420938 +++$+++ u2330 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HELMS +++$+++ This is an extremely dangerous direction, Mr. President.  Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement.
L420937 +++$+++ u2330 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HELMS +++$+++ Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
L420936 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.
L420935 +++$+++ u2330 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HELMS +++$+++ ... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy.
L420934 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Mr. Helms, we've lived with Communism in Cuba for ten years ...
L420933 +++$+++ u2330 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HELMS +++$+++ It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
L420932 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
L420931 +++$+++ u2330 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HELMS +++$+++ My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
L420930 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Are you tapping Kissinger?
L420929 +++$+++ u2330 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HELMS +++$+++ I don't think we can treat this as a formality.  Mr. Kennedy made a verbal promise to the Russians not to invade Cuba.  But you authorized Dr. Kissinger to put this in writing.
L420928 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.
L420927 +++$+++ u2330 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HELMS +++$+++ We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.
L420926 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Yes.
L420925 +++$+++ u2330 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HELMS +++$+++ Mr. Castro.
L420924 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ What?
L420923 +++$+++ u2330 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HELMS +++$+++ It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.
L420922 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
L420921 +++$+++ u2330 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HELMS +++$+++ And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.
L420920 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job.
L420919 +++$+++ u2330 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HELMS +++$+++ And me? ...
L420918 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ The President would support a reasonable request for an increase.
L420917 +++$+++ u2330 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HELMS +++$+++ Current levels may not be sufficient.
L420916 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
L420915 +++$+++ u2330 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HELMS +++$+++ Not if I give you all the cards ...
L420914 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ I'm not Jack Kennedy.  Your agency is secure.
L420913 +++$+++ u2330 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HELMS +++$+++ President Kennedy threatened to smash the CIA into a thousand pieces.  You could do the same ...
L420912 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ I'm interested in the documents that put your people together with ... the others.  All of them ...
L420911 +++$+++ u2330 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HELMS +++$+++ Diem?  Trujillo?  Lumumba?  Guatemala? Cuba? ... It's a shame you didn't take similar precautions, Dick.
L420908 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Yes ...
L420907 +++$+++ u2330 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HELMS +++$+++ You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President.
L420906 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Yes ... It involves some old and forgotten papers.  Things I signed as Vice President.  I want the originals in my office and I don't want copies anywhere else.
L420905 +++$+++ u2330 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HELMS +++$+++ Is there something else that's bothering you, Mr. President?
L420904 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Screw congressional oversight.  I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know.  Pay close attention to this.
L420903 +++$+++ u2330 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HELMS +++$+++ I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
L420902 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
L420901 +++$+++ u2330 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HELMS +++$+++ Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
L420900 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ...
L420899 +++$+++ u2330 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HELMS +++$+++ I suppose, "Mister President," you're unhappy that we have not implemented your Domestic Intelligence plan, but ...
L420897 +++$+++ u2330 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HELMS +++$+++ I didn't choose him as my deputy, Mr. President.  You did.
L420896 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Robert Cushman is a lieutenant general in the Marine Corps, the Deputy Director of the CIA ... and this is what you use him for?
L420895 +++$+++ u2330 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HELMS +++$+++ And so shall I.  Arrange some coffee, would you General Cushman?
L420894 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ My friends call me "Mister President."
L420893 +++$+++ u2330 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HELMS +++$+++ I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last.
L420714 +++$+++ u2331 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ If things remain as they are ... He's got the anti-war vote.
L420713 +++$+++ u2347 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ TOLSON +++$+++ Ummm...
L420704 +++$+++ u2331 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ Would you walk with me down to the paddock?  I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.
L420703 +++$+++ u2347 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ TOLSON +++$+++ ... little Bobby.
L420684 +++$+++ u2331 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ Kennedy -- never.  He'll fry in hell for what he did to me.  But Nixon doesn't know that, which is why I'm gonna have to remind him he needs us a helluva lot more'n we need him.
L420683 +++$+++ u2347 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ TOLSON +++$+++ It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want?
L420682 +++$+++ u2331 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ Not Joaquin, you idiot.  Nixon.  Did you hear what he said in Oregon? About me having too much power.
L420681 +++$+++ u2347 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ TOLSON +++$+++ Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
L420680 +++$+++ u2331 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
L420646 +++$+++ u2331 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ He's lying, Clyde.  Always has. That's why Nixon's always been useful. Hold still.  And take your hand off your hip.
L420645 +++$+++ u2347 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ TOLSON +++$+++ What do you think this plan is, Edgar? A nuclear attack?
L421049 +++$+++ u2331 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ It won't.  As long as I'm here.
L421048 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar?  Churchill used to say to me, "If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself."  All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me.
L421047 +++$+++ u2331 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ No one.  Your property.  It would prove your case.  Why do you think Kissinger's taping your calls?  For history.  His word against yours -- and right now he's got the records.
L421046 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
L421045 +++$+++ u2331 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ I always get my man.
L421044 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?
L421043 +++$+++ u2331 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ He's obsessed with his own image.  He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much.  As the late "Doctor" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press.
L421042 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Kissinger?
L421041 +++$+++ u2331 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
L421040 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Who do you think is behind it?
L421039 +++$+++ u2331 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ That was a mistake.  The White House was full of Kennedy people then.  It still is.
L421038 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ We took his system out.
L421037 +++$+++ u2331 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office.
L421036 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
L421035 +++$+++ u2331 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
L421034 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond.
L421033 +++$+++ u2331 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ Remember what Lenin said in 1917, Mr. President: "The power was lying in the streets just waiting for someone to pick it up."  The Communists have never been closer.  Now is the time to go back to the old themes, the ones that made you president.  Let the Communists know you're onto them.
L421032 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ There must be a quarter-million out there, Edgar.  They've been at it now for a year.  Young kids just like Tricia.  I don't know.  Do you think they have a point, Edgar?  Maybe this whole damned system of government is ...
L420725 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ The old queen did it on purpose.
L420724 +++$+++ u2331 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
L420723 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Yeah, well, as I said, Edgar ...
L420716 +++$+++ u2331 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ I know ...
L420715 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Or he'll steal it like his brother. He's a mean little sonofabitch, Edgar ... He had the IRS audit my mother when she was dying in a nursing home.
L420712 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star.  They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.
L420711 +++$+++ u2331 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ You'll win the nomination.
L420710 +++$+++ u2331 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ I know you've been very careful not to.  That's why I'm concerned.
L420709 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ I never met the man.
L420708 +++$+++ u2331 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
L420707 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Roselli?  Johnny Roselli?
L420706 +++$+++ u2331 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ I'm trying to spare you an embarrassment.  Johnny Roselli is on his way back here.
L420705 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Can't we just talk here?  I've got the police chiefs in San Diego.
L420702 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ You should ask Bobby.
L420701 +++$+++ u2331 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ How about you?  Are you going to win?
L420700 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Oh, my goodness ...
L420698 +++$+++ u2331 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ Actually, I've just had a bit of luck.
L420697 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Winning?
L420696 +++$+++ u2331 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ Thank you for coming, Dick.
L420679 +++$+++ u2331 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
L420678 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ...
L420673 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can assure you.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
L420672 +++$+++ u2331 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can tell you that.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
L421073 +++$+++ u2332 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HUNT +++$+++ I won't tell him if you won't.
L421072 +++$+++ u2346 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ STURGIS +++$+++ So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
L421071 +++$+++ u2332 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HUNT +++$+++ Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
L421070 +++$+++ u2346 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ STURGIS +++$+++ Where'd you find him?
L421066 +++$+++ u2332 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HUNT +++$+++ A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
L421065 +++$+++ u2346 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ STURGIS +++$+++ Who we working for?
L421064 +++$+++ u2332 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HUNT +++$+++ We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.  We're gonna plug a leak.
L421063 +++$+++ u2346 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ STURGIS +++$+++ You're fucking me.
L421062 +++$+++ u2332 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HUNT +++$+++ The White House.
L421061 +++$+++ u2346 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ STURGIS +++$+++ Why, you got a customer?
L421060 +++$+++ u2346 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ STURGIS +++$+++ They're around.
L421059 +++$+++ u2332 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HUNT +++$+++ Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys?
L421058 +++$+++ u2346 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ STURGIS +++$+++ How the fuck did you know?
L420123 +++$+++ u2332 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HUNT +++$+++ Personally, I'll be calling the President of the United States.
L420122 +++$+++ u2335 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ LIDDY +++$+++ Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.
L420121 +++$+++ u2332 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HUNT +++$+++ Let's get the fuck out of here, shall we, ladies?
L420118 +++$+++ u2335 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ LIDDY +++$+++ Remember -- listen up!  Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration.  Check yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero three-hundred.
L420117 +++$+++ u2332 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HUNT +++$+++ Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
L420116 +++$+++ u2335 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ LIDDY +++$+++ "A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
L420115 +++$+++ u2332 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HUNT +++$+++ Mein Kampf?
L420114 +++$+++ u2332 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HUNT +++$+++ Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow.  It keeps me calm.  I don't like going back into the same building four times.
L420113 +++$+++ u2335 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ LIDDY +++$+++ Howard ... What the hell?  What're you doing?
L421156 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Presidents don't threaten.  They don't have to.  Good day, gentlemen.
L421155 +++$+++ u2333 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Well, goddamn.  Are you threatening me, Dick?
L421154 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Because if you're uncomfortable with the EPA up your ass, try the IRS ...
L421151 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ The American people put me where I am.
L421150 +++$+++ u2333 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ ... And now I have a federal judge ordering me to bus my kids halfway 'cross town to go to school with some nigger kids. I think, Mr. President, you're forgetting who put you where you are.
L421147 +++$+++ u2333 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ I mean I got federal price controls on my oil.  The ragheads are beating the shit out of me.  And I got your EPA environment agency with its thumb so far up my ass it's scratching my ear.
L421146 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ What do you mean, Jack?
L421145 +++$+++ u2333 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Desi's got a point.  What the hell are we gonna do about the Communists right here in our backyard?!
L421136 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ It's nobody's fault, Jack.  It's change -- which is a fact of history. Even that old cocksucker Hoover's dead.  Things change.
L421135 +++$+++ u2333 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
L421134 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
L421133 +++$+++ u2333 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ It looks like to me we're gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and, Dick, goddamn it, you're going along with it, buying into this Kissinger bullshit -- "detente" with the Communists.  "Detente" -- it sounds like two fags dancing.
L421132 +++$+++ u2333 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Well, you sure been chock full of surprises so far, "Mister President."
L421131 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support.
L421130 +++$+++ u2333 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ So, what's this about, Dick?
L420575 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Nobody's gonna beat Kennedy in '64 with all the money in the world.
L420574 +++$+++ u2333 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of.
L420573 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.
L420572 +++$+++ u2333 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
L420571 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Gentlemen, I tried.  I told Kennedy to go into Cuba.  He heard me and he made his decision.  I appreciate your sentiments.  I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots, but it's nothing I can do anything about.  Now, it's a long drive back to Dallas tonight, and Trini and I have got an early flight tomorrow to New York ...
L420569 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Agreed.
L420568 +++$+++ u2333 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to the Russians.  And he don't know what the hell he's doing in Vietnam.  These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business ...
L420544 +++$+++ u2333 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ He's all business, ain't he, Trini?  Dick, we could've had our own goddamn lawyers handle this deal.  We brought you down here 'cause we wanted to talk to you ...
L420543 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ By the way, Jack, this looks like a pretty straight-forward transaction to me, but we should get into it soon -- just take a few minutes, maybe up at the house ...
L420542 +++$+++ u2333 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Her name's Sandy ...
L420541 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ She's quite pretty.
L420540 +++$+++ u2333 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ I know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a Republican, and she'd do anything for the Party.
L420538 +++$+++ u2333 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ We'll see about that.
L420537 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Like you said Jack, I'm just a New York lawyer now.
L420534 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Well, uh, Trini and I have an early plane.  We were hoping to get back to New York in time for ...
L420533 +++$+++ u2333 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Party ain't started yet, Dick.  Got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... There's some fellows I want you to meet.
L420532 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Thanks, Jack.  You sure throw a helluva party.
L421522 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Don't be too proud; never be too proud to go on your knees before God.
L421521 +++$+++ u2334 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ KISSINGER +++$+++ Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it?
L421520 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ ... Uh, I hope this doesn't embarrass you.
L421519 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Yes.  My mother used to pray ... a lot.  It's been a long time since I really prayed.  Let's pray, Henry; let's pray a little.
L421518 +++$+++ u2334 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ KISSINGER +++$+++ Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees?
L421517 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
L421516 +++$+++ u2334 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ KISSINGER +++$+++ You have many friends ... and admirers ...
L421515 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Don't be stupid.  The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways.  You're the only friend I've got, Henry.
L421514 +++$+++ u2334 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ KISSINGER +++$+++ If they harass you, I, too, will resign.  And I will tell the world why.
L421513 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ That depends who writes the history books.  I'm not a quitter ... but I'm not stupid either ... A trial would kill me -- that's what they want.  But they won't get it.
L421512 +++$+++ u2334 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ KISSINGER +++$+++ They will understand, sir.  To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions.  History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries.
L421511 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Yes, you always had a good sense of timing, Henry.  When to give and when to take. How do you think Mao, Brezhnev will react?  Do you think this is how they'll remember me, Henry, after all the great things you and I did together? As some kind of ... of ... crooks?
L421477 +++$+++ u2334 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ KISSINGER +++$+++ Oh God, I'm going to throw up.
L421476 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ ... because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook.  Well, I am not a crook.  I have never made a dime from public service ...
