L196953 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ I love her. If she would be my queen, my dreams would be answered.
L196952 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ ...of course...
L196951 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ A king must marry, after all.
L196931 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ What's this, what's this?!
L196930 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy.
L196912 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ The dragon! There...
L196911 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ What?!
L196910 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders.
L196909 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ What book is that?
L196908 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ In the great book.
L196907 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ How? Where?
L196904 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?
L196903 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I--
L196902 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ Thank you.
L196901 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...
L196900 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen.
L196899 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
L196898 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ It is whispered in the forest that...  ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.
L196896 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ 'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.
L196895 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how--
L196894 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ That's not why you came.
L196893 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ I want to thank you.
L196892 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ But not from your destiny.
L196891 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ You saved me from the arrow...
L196883 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ You are the son of King Uther, and the fair Igrayne... you are King Arthur.
L196882 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ Whose son am I?
L196880 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ Speak of the devil!...
L196879 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ Who is Merlin?
L197264 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ So be it.
L197263 +++$+++ u5131 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MORDRED +++$+++ I will muster a great force of knights, and I will return to fight for what is mine.
L197261 +++$+++ u5131 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MORDRED +++$+++ And I offer only this, Father. To commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit, as man and king.
L197260 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ I cannot offer you the land, only my love...
L197259 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ Your mother told you that?
L197258 +++$+++ u5131 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MORDRED +++$+++ The very spear that pierced the side of Christ as he died on the cross.
L197257 +++$+++ u5131 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MORDRED +++$+++ And you are the great King? The lords have rebelled. Invaders attack the coasts. Crops don't grow. There is nothing but plague and hunger in the land. Only I am feared. I will be king. You may have lost Excalibur, but I have found my own weapon of power. There.
L197256 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ I recognize you only as my son, no more.
L197255 +++$+++ u5131 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MORDRED +++$+++ I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
L197254 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ Rise, Mordred.
L197253 +++$+++ u5131 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MORDRED +++$+++ Father...
L196965 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ We fought and won battles, and now one man defeats all my knights? I will go.
L196964 +++$+++ u5134 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ SIR ECTOR +++$+++ He is the mightiest and fairest of knights.
L196878 +++$+++ u5134 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ SIR ECTOR +++$+++ I don't know. Merlin brought you to me when you were newly born and charged me to raise you as my own. At first, I did so because I feared Merlin, later because I loved you.
L196877 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ Who is, then?
L196867 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ I did, Father. I beg your forgiveness.
L196866 +++$+++ u5134 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ SIR ECTOR +++$+++ You freed it, son?
L196865 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I took it.
L196853 +++$+++ u5134 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ SIR ECTOR +++$+++ Well hurry then, and get it.
L196852 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ I left it in the tent, sir.
L197286 +++$+++ u5127 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ GUENEVERE +++$+++ I have kept it.
L197285 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be.
L197284 +++$+++ u5127 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ GUENEVERE +++$+++ I loved you much, as King, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky.
L197140 +++$+++ u5127 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ GUENEVERE +++$+++ And if he cannot be found, no other knight will champion me, though you beseeched each and every one of them. Why be king if there is no one you can call loyal subject but an eager boy?
L197139 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
L197138 +++$+++ u5127 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ GUENEVERE +++$+++ And you cannot love me...
L197137 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
L197136 +++$+++ u5127 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ GUENEVERE +++$+++ Why can't you be my champion?
L197125 +++$+++ u5127 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ GUENEVERE +++$+++ Not you, my husband?
L197124 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.
L197118 +++$+++ u5127 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ GUENEVERE +++$+++ No. I meant not to be angry with you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil. You merely repeat it. Please, sir, have one of those apples that Lancelot loves, and in that gesture partake of its goodness.
L197117 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen.
L197043 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ Without Lancelot?!
L197042 +++$+++ u5127 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ GUENEVERE +++$+++ Don't start a war on my wedding day!
L197041 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, rest here.
L197037 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ I grant you your wish if you grant Lady Guenevere hers.
L197036 +++$+++ u5127 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ GUENEVERE +++$+++ He must stay for the feasting days of our wedding, and tell his deeds himself.
L196947 +++$+++ u5127 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ GUENEVERE +++$+++ Quiet, or I'll sew up your mouth too.
L196946 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ I'm going.
L196945 +++$+++ u5127 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ GUENEVERE +++$+++ No, I think it's better if you just stay here to heal. At least a week.
L196944 +++$+++ u5127 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ GUENEVERE +++$+++ Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
L196943 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
L196942 +++$+++ u5127 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ GUENEVERE +++$+++ --And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
L196941 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores...
L196939 +++$+++ u5127 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ GUENEVERE +++$+++ --I'm pretty good at stitchery. I've sewn my father's wounds more than once.
L196938 +++$+++ u5125 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ Ye...
L196937 +++$+++ u5127 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ GUENEVERE +++$+++ It didn't hurt too much, did it?
L197275 +++$+++ u5133 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ PERCEVAL +++$+++ You and the land are one. Drink from the chalice. You will be reborn and the land with you.
L197274 +++$+++ u5126 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ FIGURE +++$+++ I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
L197273 +++$+++ u5133 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ PERCEVAL +++$+++ Because you and the land are one.
L197272 +++$+++ u5126 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ FIGURE +++$+++ I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
L197271 +++$+++ u5133 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ PERCEVAL +++$+++ You, my lord.
L197270 +++$+++ u5126 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ FIGURE +++$+++ Who does it serve?
L197195 +++$+++ u5127 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ GUENEVERE +++$+++ We are to blame.
L197194 +++$+++ u5129 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ LANCELOT +++$+++ The King without his sword, the land without a king...
L197193 +++$+++ u5127 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ GUENEVERE +++$+++ He has given up.
L197192 +++$+++ u5129 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ LANCELOT +++$+++ Why didn't he kill us?
L197176 +++$+++ u5127 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ GUENEVERE +++$+++ --Nothing!
L197175 +++$+++ u5129 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ LANCELOT +++$+++ There are things about love--
L197174 +++$+++ u5127 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ GUENEVERE +++$+++ Love demands it.
L197173 +++$+++ u5129 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ LANCELOT +++$+++ The law forbids it.
L197057 +++$+++ u5129 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ LANCELOT +++$+++ I cannot love as a woman the lady who will be wife to my King and my friend. And, in pledging my love to you, I cannot love any other woman.
L197056 +++$+++ u5127 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ GUENEVERE +++$+++ To me? But why?
L197055 +++$+++ u5129 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ LANCELOT +++$+++ Yes. I would swear my love to you.
L197054 +++$+++ u5127 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ GUENEVERE +++$+++ Me?
L197053 +++$+++ u5129 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ LANCELOT +++$+++ You.
L197052 +++$+++ u5127 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ GUENEVERE +++$+++ Who?!
L197051 +++$+++ u5129 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ LANCELOT +++$+++ There is one.
L197050 +++$+++ u5127 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ GUENEVERE +++$+++ And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
L197049 +++$+++ u5129 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ LANCELOT +++$+++ I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
L197048 +++$+++ u5127 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ GUENEVERE +++$+++ Why?
L197047 +++$+++ u5129 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ LANCELOT +++$+++ No.
L197046 +++$+++ u5127 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ GUENEVERE +++$+++ The well-kept secret is whether any of them has won your heart.
L197135 +++$+++ u5129 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ LANCELOT +++$+++ --It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
L197134 +++$+++ u5133 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ PERCEVAL +++$+++ I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
L197084 +++$+++ u5133 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ PERCEVAL +++$+++ Twenty days!? The world is that big?
L197083 +++$+++ u5129 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ LANCELOT +++$+++ Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
L197082 +++$+++ u5133 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ PERCEVAL +++$+++ I will run.
L197081 +++$+++ u5129 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ LANCELOT +++$+++ Very well. Climb up.
L197077 +++$+++ u5133 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ PERCEVAL +++$+++ You're a man?!  ...with metal skin!
L197076 +++$+++ u5129 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ LANCELOT +++$+++ Just a man. A knight in the King's service.
L197319 +++$+++ u5132 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MORGANA +++$+++ --I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping...
L197318 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ --I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
L197317 +++$+++ u5132 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MORGANA +++$+++ I am the desert, where water disappears--
L197316 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
L197312 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake.
L197311 +++$+++ u5132 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MORGANA +++$+++ You provoke me, Merlin.
L197209 +++$+++ u5132 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MORGANA +++$+++ Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man...
L197208 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ What do you want? You must desire it for me to weave it.
L197206 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you.
L197205 +++$+++ u5132 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MORGANA +++$+++ Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me!
L197204 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...
L197203 +++$+++ u5132 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MORGANA +++$+++ You are truly magnificent!
L197199 +++$+++ u5132 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MORGANA +++$+++ Why?
L197198 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ They do.
L197197 +++$+++ u5132 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MORGANA +++$+++ People make you laugh?
L197196 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.
L197190 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ That I cannot.
L197189 +++$+++ u5132 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MORGANA +++$+++ You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world.
L197105 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ Maybe... maybe...
L197104 +++$+++ u5132 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MORGANA +++$+++ The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
L197103 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ I showed you all my conjuring tricks...
L197101 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.
L197100 +++$+++ u5132 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MORGANA +++$+++ A lovestruck page!
L197099 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...
L197098 +++$+++ u5132 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MORGANA +++$+++ It's clear you are, and it irks me.
L197097 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ I'm not jealous!
L197096 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ No, no, of course not. You are young...
L197067 +++$+++ u5132 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MORGANA +++$+++ Can it truly be used for magic?
L197066 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ It is.
L197065 +++$+++ u5132 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MORGANA +++$+++ Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
L197064 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?
L196838 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ They are not weapons, my friend, but truths. You betrayed the Duke, stole his wife and took his castle, now no one trusts you. Lot, Uryens, your allies will turn against you. Give me the child, Uther, I will protect him. Go back to your war tent.
L196837 +++$+++ u5135 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ UTHER +++$+++ You strike me with words as hard as steel.
L196836 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...
L196835 +++$+++ u5135 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ UTHER +++$+++ To kill and be king, is that all?
L196834 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ It's not for you, Uther, hearth and home, wife and child.
L196830 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ You didn't ask!
L196829 +++$+++ u5135 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ UTHER +++$+++ The oath. You didn't say--
L196828 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ The child is mine, Uther. I have come for him.
L196827 +++$+++ u5135 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ UTHER +++$+++ I?
L196826 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ Now you must pay me.
L196825 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ Doing what I did for you, it wasn't easy, you know. It takes it's toll. It took nine moons to get back my strength.
L196824 +++$+++ u5135 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ UTHER +++$+++ Merlin! Out of the sick sleep at last.
L196788 +++$+++ u5135 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ UTHER +++$+++ I swear it.
L196787 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ --What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again.
L196786 +++$+++ u5135 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ UTHER +++$+++ I swear it. By Excalibur and the holy--
L196782 +++$+++ u5135 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ UTHER +++$+++ Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.
L196781 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when.
L196761 +++$+++ u5135 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ UTHER +++$+++ One land, one king! That is my peace!
L196760 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow.  Speak the words.
L196759 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ Just show the sword.
L196758 +++$+++ u5135 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ UTHER +++$+++ I should butcher all and every one of them. Merlin, what is this wagging of tongues?
L196756 +++$+++ u5135 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ UTHER +++$+++ Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
L196755 +++$+++ u5130 +++$+++ m340 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ It's done. A truce. We meet at the river.
L197639 +++$+++ u5136 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ Fuck it.
L197638 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ What honey?
L197406 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Hiding?
L197405 +++$+++ u5136 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
L197404 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Well why are they tearing the building down?
L197403 +++$+++ u5136 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ Well what's wrong?
L197402 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
L197401 +++$+++ u5136 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
L197400 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn't make sense.
L198082 +++$+++ u5149 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Ten maybe twelve years ago, in Africa. The exorcism supposedly lasted for months. I heard it damn near killed him.
L198081 +++$+++ u5137 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CARDINAL +++$+++ I didn't know that.
L198080 +++$+++ u5149 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
L198079 +++$+++ u5137 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CARDINAL +++$+++ Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
L198078 +++$+++ u5149 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ No, he's working on another book.
L198077 +++$+++ u5137 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CARDINAL +++$+++ What's he doing there? Teaching?
L198076 +++$+++ u5149 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
L198075 +++$+++ u5137 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CARDINAL +++$+++ Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
L198074 +++$+++ u5149 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ How about Lankaster Merrin.
L198073 +++$+++ u5137 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CARDINAL +++$+++ And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
L198072 +++$+++ u5149 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Well, he does know the background. I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist. There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway.
L198071 +++$+++ u5144 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARRAS +++$+++ Thank you your excellency.
L198070 +++$+++ u5137 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CARDINAL +++$+++ Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.
L198069 +++$+++ u5144 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARRAS +++$+++ I see, your excellency.
L198068 +++$+++ u5137 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CARDINAL +++$+++ It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
L198067 +++$+++ u5144 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARRAS +++$+++ Yes.
L198066 +++$+++ u5137 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CARDINAL +++$+++ You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
L198065 +++$+++ u5144 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARRAS +++$+++ I don't know. No, not really I suppose. But I've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual.
L198064 +++$+++ u5137 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CARDINAL +++$+++ You're convinced that it's genuine.
L197857 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ You're telling me that, I should take my daughter to a witch doctor? Is that it?
L197856 +++$+++ u5139 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CLINIC DIRECTOR +++$+++ It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's pretty much discarded these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of suggestion. The victim's belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.
L197849 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...
L197848 +++$+++ u5139 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CLINIC DIRECTOR +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L197847 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
L197846 +++$+++ u5139 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CLINIC DIRECTOR +++$+++ It's-
L197845 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!
L197844 +++$+++ u5139 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CLINIC DIRECTOR +++$+++ Quite frankly, we don't know much about it except that it's starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the patient's delusion that his body's been invaded by an alien intellegence; a spirit if you will.
L198198 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Sure you won't change your mind?
