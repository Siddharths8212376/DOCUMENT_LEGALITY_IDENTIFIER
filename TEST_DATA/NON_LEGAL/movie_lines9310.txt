L424297 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Rosa...
L424296 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
L424295 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Are you sure I can borrow this?
L424239 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ But, you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. You come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him!  Betty, you are one-of-a-kind...
L424238 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No, almost never.
L424237 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?
L424236 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ I have, lots of times. My mother used to clean them. I used to piss in their pools.
L424235 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
L424234 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
L424233 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
L424232 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
L424231 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
L424230 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
L424229 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ He is real.
L424228 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Does he know you think he's real?
L424227 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ You still in love?
L424226 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
L424225 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Were you with him this whole time?
L424118 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ You never know who you'll see.
L424117 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Looking for someone?
L424101 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Umm...
L424100 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
L424099 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What are those for?
L424098 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ ...okay.
L424097 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ So what do you say? Can we be friends?
L424096 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
L424095 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
L424070 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Fine.
L424069 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
L424067 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ HE IS REAL!!
L424066 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
L424065 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Why'd you help me in the first place?
L424063 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!!  You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! Not the actor -- whose name is George, by the way. His character!
L424062 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
L424061 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
L424060 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Shhh! I heard you the first time.
L424059 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
L424058 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I have no idea what you're talking about.
L424057 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!
L424056 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ ON TELEVISION!!  Cut the shit, will you!
L424055 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What? Where was he?!
L424054 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Doctor David Ravell.
L424053 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Who?
L424052 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Guess who I saw today.
L424022 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ I was talking about what you could wear!
L424021 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You said in L.A., anything goes.
L424020 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
L424019 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ How many men have I talked to?
L424018 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?
L424017 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
L424016 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
L424015 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
L424014 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ ...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories...  We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission.
L424013 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
L424012 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
L424011 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
L424010 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
L424009 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ God, that's awful!
L424008 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
L424007 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ He has a wife?!
L424006 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
L424005 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
L424004 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
L424003 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'
L424002 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?
L424001 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
L424000 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
L423999 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
L423998 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ The Five?
L423997 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
L423996 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
L423975 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
L423974 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
L423973 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
L423972 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
L423971 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ No, this one was worse... I had to have the place sprayed when he left. Twice... He was two guys before the last one -- not counting a little office thing in there, which I'm trusting you with, 'cause if it gets out, I'm on the street...
L423970 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ The one you were telling me about?
L423969 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ I got this apartment with a guy.
L423967 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Listen, when someone does the kind of thing you did, you gotta do something in return. So, you stay with me until you find your David and live happily ever after. Okay?
L423966 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No, that's not, I couldn't...
L423965 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down.
L423962 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Man, that is love.
L423961 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
L423960 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ 'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
L423959 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It's something I had to do. For David.
L423956 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I came for love. My fiancé is here.
L423955 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ So why'd you come to L.A.?
L423954 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
L423953 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ You don't sound like you're from here.
L423917 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S DEAD!
L423916 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
L423915 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
L423914 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ You're hurting him!!
L423913 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ He has no heartbeat!
L423912 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ What are you doing?
L423362 +++$+++ u2370 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BLAKE +++$+++ No, you're not. You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now, if you'll excuse me...
L423361 +++$+++ u2383 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LONNIE +++$+++ I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
L423360 +++$+++ u2370 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BLAKE +++$+++ Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
L423359 +++$+++ u2383 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LONNIE +++$+++ Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
L423358 +++$+++ u2370 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BLAKE +++$+++ We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
L423357 +++$+++ u2383 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LONNIE +++$+++ Blake, I can handle that transplant!
L424401 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Good.
L424400 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No, that should be more than --
L424399 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ More than you know. Is there anything else?
L424398 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
L424397 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ That won't be necessary. She's staying with a Rosa something... Hernandez, Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in Silverlake.
L424396 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Deranged. That would be the right word.
L424395 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
L424394 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What can I do for you, gentlemen?
L423689 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Andersonville.  They did horrible things to men there...
L423688 +++$+++ u2376 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DUANE +++$+++ Really. And where was that, old man?
L423687 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
L423686 +++$+++ u2376 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DUANE +++$+++ He goin' crazy on us, or what?
L423685 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
L423684 +++$+++ u2376 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DUANE +++$+++ The fuck you talking about?
L423683 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book.
L423682 +++$+++ u2376 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DUANE +++$+++ Huh?
L423681 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.
L423680 +++$+++ u2376 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DUANE +++$+++ Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone. Get it?  They're Korean, so they're pretty hot.
L423677 +++$+++ u2376 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DUANE +++$+++ Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.
L423676 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
L423534 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...and put them in your mouth.
L423533 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.
L423530 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ My socks?
L423529 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
L423528 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ I... I don't know...
L423527 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
L423526 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
L423525 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Like what?
L423524 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
L423523 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You did not just say "Injuns," Del.
L423515 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hmmmm. "Five Stars," huh?  Is that stupid, Wesley?
L423514 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?
L423511 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Are we gonna do business here, or not?
L423510 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
L423509 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ No...
L423508 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
L423507 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ I don't follow...
L423506 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
L423505 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Of what?
L423504 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Could you give us an example?
L423501 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks.
L423500 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L423497 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Are you kidding me? What's to like?
L423496 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
L423495 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Fine. You got five...
L423494 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.
L423491 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ You don't exactly look like drug dealers.
L423490 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ If we're for real?
L423489 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
L423484 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Ahh... my wife's.
L423483 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy...  Who's birthday?
L423482 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup.
L423481 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Oh, yes, with the coffee...
L423480 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
L423472 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
L423471 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ ...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
L424459 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ What's wrong with you?
L424458 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Not her mouth...  I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon.
L424448 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No, I said to follow 'my' instincts. Now, we go up there and conclude our business. Case closed.
L424447 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
L424446 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here --
L424445 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ ...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
L424444 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out.
L424443 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
L424442 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
L424440 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
L424439 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ You were right. Del wasn't lying.
