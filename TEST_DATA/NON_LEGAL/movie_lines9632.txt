L106552 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ No.
L106551 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ You have to ask?
L106550 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?
L106549 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Tell me about it.
L106548 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ ...  I needed that.
L106543 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Don't apologize, please.  I can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex.
L106542 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I wanted to apologize.
L106541 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
L106540 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I had to see you.
L106502 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ ...  yes.
L106501 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ No.
L106500 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
L106499 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
L106493 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Because I want to.  I've wanted to since I first saw you in the elevator.
L106492 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Why?
L106491 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you.
L106484 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I have a tattoo, would you like to see it?
L106483 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Maybe.
L106482 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Are you surprised that I know what it is?
L106479 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.
L106478 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Curious, maybe.
L106476 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ No.
L106475 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ You seem uncomfortable.  Do I make you nervous, Corky?
L106472 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ A beer.  Of course.
L106471 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ A beer?
L106470 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ What do you want?
L106469 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Okay, one drink.
L106467 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it.  I did it.
L106466 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Thank you so much.  You have to let me pay you something --
L106463 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Sure.
L106462 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Do you have a pot or a bucket?
L106461 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ I told Bianchinni I would take a look.  Is it that sink?
L106460 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I shouldn't have called...
L106457 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Yeah, come on in.
L106456 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ He said you lost something.
L106455 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
L106454 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Not exactly.
L106453 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Oh no.  Shit.  I didn't know he would call you.  God, you must think |I'm a total nuisance.
L106429 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ My pleasure.
L106428 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Thanks.
L106427 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I should be going.  You can drop the cup off anytime.
L106426 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying kind.
L106425 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Caesar is your husband?
L106424 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
L106423 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Do you know him?
L106422 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Oh, really.
L106421 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
L106420 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
L106419 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I knew it.
L106418 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ '63 Chevy.
L106417 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Truck.  Of course.
L106416 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Truck.
L106414 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.
L106413 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Yeah.
L106412 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ You're doing everything yourself?
L106411 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.
L106410 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
L106409 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Are they really?
L106408 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
L106407 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry --
L106406 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
L106405 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ A favor?
L106404 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
L106403 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.
L106402 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Good guess.
L106401 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I guessed you were straight black.
L106400 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Pretty much.  One day at a time.
L106399 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ So this is temporary for you?
L106398 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Oh, he went home to India, but as far as I know he'll be back.
L106397 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
L106396 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Who?
L106393 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I heard you working in here and I just wondered if you'd like a cup of coffee?
L106392 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.
L106391 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Hi.  My name is Violet.  We sort of met in the elevator --
L106941 +++$+++ u4212 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ JOHNNIE +++$+++ Pop, this is important to me.  It's a simple question.  if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.
L106940 +++$+++ u4211 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ GINO +++$+++ Johnnie, what did I say?
L106936 +++$+++ u4211 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ GINO +++$+++ Hey, Johnnie ...
L106935 +++$+++ u4212 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ JOHNNIE +++$+++ Unbelievable.  Can you believe that, Violet?
L106931 +++$+++ u4212 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ JOHNNIE +++$+++ Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves.
L106930 +++$+++ u4211 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ GINO +++$+++ Done.  We go now.
L106923 +++$+++ u4211 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ GINO +++$+++ Caesar, come here.  Sit.  We talk now.  You too, Johnnie.
L106922 +++$+++ u4212 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ JOHNNIE +++$+++ Pop?
L106921 +++$+++ u4211 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ GINO +++$+++ No, Johnnie.  No goddamned phones. Not now.
L106913 +++$+++ u4212 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ JOHNNIE +++$+++ You are as radiant as ever, Violet.
L106912 +++$+++ u4211 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ GINO +++$+++ Hey, Caesar!  You take care of this girl, or I find out!
L107285 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Thanks, Mickey, but I need to get out, you know?  Get away from all of this.
L107284 +++$+++ u4213 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Sure you're going to be okay?  I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.
L107283 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I know you will.
L107282 +++$+++ u4213 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
L107281 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.
L107269 +++$+++ u4213 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Violet?
L107268 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!
L107240 +++$+++ u4213 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I think everything is okay.
L107239 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
L107238 +++$+++ u4213 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident.
L107237 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Mickey?  What are you doing here?
L107086 +++$+++ u4213 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Caesar?  What the fuck time is it?
L107085 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Oh, God.
L106643 +++$+++ u4213 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Don't worry about Caesar.  I'll handle Caesar.  You just get out of here, okay?
L106642 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Caesar wants me to stay.
L106641 +++$+++ u4213 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You shouldn't have to see this.  Why don't you get out of here?  Go for a walk.
L109038 +++$+++ u4218 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ CONKLIN +++$+++ I can't call it off.  He's not responding.  Get out of my way.
L109037 +++$+++ u4215 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
L109036 +++$+++ u4218 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ CONKLIN +++$+++ You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
L109035 +++$+++ u4215 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ <u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.
L109034 +++$+++ u4218 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ CONKLIN +++$+++ I'm going to Paris.
L109008 +++$+++ u4218 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ CONKLIN +++$+++ We're in the shitter, man!  Pick your poison.  Maybe he's in there to finish the job.  Maybe he's working for Wombosi.  Maybe they want to go on TV together.  Every possibility sucks -- we've got to move!
L109007 +++$+++ u4215 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ We don't know what we're into!
L109006 +++$+++ u4218 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ CONKLIN +++$+++ What do you want to do?
L109005 +++$+++ u4215 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ Forget it.
L109004 +++$+++ u4218 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ CONKLIN +++$+++ -- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
L109003 +++$+++ u4215 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ -- <u>inside</u> the house? --
L109002 +++$+++ u4218 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ CONKLIN +++$+++ -- if we can get a clean shot --
L109001 +++$+++ u4215 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ -- he went inside! --
L108941 +++$+++ u4215 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ This doesn't go upstairs.
L108940 +++$+++ u4218 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ CONKLIN +++$+++ Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
L108939 +++$+++ u4215 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ No.  We can't risk it.
L108915 +++$+++ u4218 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ CONKLIN +++$+++ Turn?  To who?  Where does he turn? What does he have to offer?  He's got nothing.  He's a killer.  He's a piece of equipment for crissake. Where's he gonna turn?
L108914 +++$+++ u4215 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
L108913 +++$+++ u4218 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ CONKLIN +++$+++ That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do.
L108778 +++$+++ u4215 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ I'm not asking.
L108777 +++$+++ u4218 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ CONKLIN +++$+++ <u>This is an operations desk</u>.
L108776 +++$+++ u4215 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ I want a second opinion.
L108775 +++$+++ u4218 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ CONKLIN +++$+++ We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been <u>sleeping</u> down here.  We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we <u>finally</u> have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here?  I'd rethink that.
L108774 +++$+++ u4215 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
L108773 +++$+++ u4218 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ CONKLIN +++$+++ No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
L108772 +++$+++ u4215 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
L108771 +++$+++ u4218 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ CONKLIN +++$+++ We're exploring <u>every</u> possibility.  We are in pursuit.  How much more do you want me to tell you?
L108770 +++$+++ u4215 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
L108769 +++$+++ u4218 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ CONKLIN +++$+++ She's a gypsy.  If it's a cover, it's a great one.
L108599 +++$+++ u4218 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ CONKLIN +++$+++ Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it?  We'll clean up the field.  You clean up your budgets.
L108598 +++$+++ u4215 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ And what if I couldn't do that?
L108597 +++$+++ u4218 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ CONKLIN +++$+++ You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that.
L108596 +++$+++ u4215 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ They're putting together an agency oversight committee.  They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  What am I going to do about that?
L108595 +++$+++ u4218 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ CONKLIN +++$+++ I thought you were never going to do that.
L108594 +++$+++ u4215 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ Yes.
L108593 +++$+++ u4218 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ CONKLIN +++$+++ You're asking me a direct question?
L108592 +++$+++ u4215 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.  Was this Treadstone?
L108591 +++$+++ u4218 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ CONKLIN +++$+++ I don't know what we're talking about.
L108590 +++$+++ u4215 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear.
L109103 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Why?
L109102 +++$+++ u4225 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ ...they won't let you go...
L109101 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ What do they want me to do?
L109100 +++$+++ u4225 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ ...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
L109099 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I think so.
L109098 +++$+++ u4225 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ ...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
L109097 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ What is Treadstone?
L109096 +++$+++ u4225 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ ...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  Treadstone had those pills...
L109095 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Treadstone.
L109094 +++$+++ u4225 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ ...it's a problem...
L109093 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Yes.
L109092 +++$+++ u4225 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ ...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
L109091 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Paris.  I live in Paris...
L109090 +++$+++ u4225 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ ...which one are you?...
L109089 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Treadstone?
L109088 +++$+++ u4225 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
L109087 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L109086 +++$+++ u4225 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone.
L109085 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I won't ask again.
L109135 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ That'll be their second worst mistake.
L109134 +++$+++ u4218 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ CONKLIN +++$+++ Jason...  They can't let you go...
L109133 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Keep it. 
L109132 +++$+++ u4218 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ CONKLIN +++$+++ <u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
L109131 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Jason Bourne is dead.
L109130 +++$+++ u4218 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ CONKLIN +++$+++ We have to go home, Jason.
L109129 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I don't think so.
L109128 +++$+++ u4218 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ CONKLIN +++$+++ We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
L109127 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ That's all I get?
L109126 +++$+++ u4218 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ CONKLIN +++$+++ So it's time to go home.
L109125 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ So now you know.
L109124 +++$+++ u4218 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ CONKLIN +++$+++ Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
L109123 +++$+++ u4216 +++$+++ m282 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I know you've been trying to kill me.
