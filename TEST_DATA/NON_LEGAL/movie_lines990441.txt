L615728 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Then you don't have to tell her--cut out New York.
L615727 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Sure.
L615726 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Your wife knows that, don't she?
L615725 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ In New York.
L615724 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Where do you live?
L615723 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ How?
L615722 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.
L615717 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ What'll I say?
L615716 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Here you are, sir. 
L616341 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ All right, folks, get on your mark. When you hear the pistol shot--
L616340 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ I was never stiffer in my life.
L616339 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
L616338 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Who won?
L616337 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Come on, get up.  That horse is carrying too much of a load.
L615719 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ That's fine.
L615718 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
L615715 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ She's in New York.
L615714 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank.  Where is your wife?
L615713 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ That's news to me. I'd better cable my wife.
L615712 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
L615711 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
L615710 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Well, did you find me?
L615709 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
L615708 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ I thought I put you to bed.
L615707 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Hello, Denby!
L615530 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ <U>Nuts</U> to you too!
L615529 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ I can see where I won't talk much to you.
L615526 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ So what?
L615525 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Yes--Me--in person!
L615524 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
L615523 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ That's me!
L615520 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ I can see you're no gentleman--
L615519 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Knots!
L615518 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ What?
L615517 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ No. <U>Knots</U>!
L615516 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
L615515 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
L615514 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ I'll say--how fast is this boat going?
L615982 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Never mind.
L615981 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
L615980 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
L615979 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
L615978 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Oh, there you are--
L615522 +++$+++ u8468 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ <U>Denby!</U>--Are you Chad Denby?
L615521 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ He's funny--maybe you can use him in the show, Mr. Denby.
L616483 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Yes!
L616482 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Is this your gun?
L616481 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
L616480 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
L616479 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ I didn't--
L616283 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Yeah--
L616282 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Maybe he just travels in bad company.
L616281 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
L616280 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
L616279 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
L616278 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
L616277 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
L616276 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
L615849 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Oh no--I don't want to impose on you--  It's funny about that billfold--I could have sworn I had it- 
L615848 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
L615847 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
L615846 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
L615845 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
L615815 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.
L615814 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.
L615811 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Too bad we're not making a trip around the world-- maybe we could finish this game.  Hey! When you get through with that conference, shoot that last disk!
L615810 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
L615809 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Here we are, folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket--  What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?
L615766 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Miss Marsh.
L615765 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ McKinney's the name.
L616402 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Of course--but--  There's your cue--hurry up--
L616401 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Why--don't you like him?
L616400 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Very--
L616399 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Very serious?
L616398 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Yes.
L615793 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ <U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
L615792 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I don't get the humor of that remark.
L615791 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
L615790 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
L615622 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.
L615621 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?
L615620 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ I'll never love anybody else.
L615619 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
L615618 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ But not nice enough to marry--eh?
L615617 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
L615616 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
L615615 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
L615614 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
L615613 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
L615612 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
L615611 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
L615610 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
L615609 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
L615608 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Do what--
L615607 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
L615606 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
L615605 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
L615604 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ No--not much--excepting-- 
L615603 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
L615602 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
L615601 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ And you've put it over--haven't you?
L615600 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
L615599 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
L615598 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Like it?
L615597 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
L615596 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Just what the doctor ordered.
L615595 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Everything O.K.?
L615594 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo--  Get out of here. 
L615593 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--
L615592 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Am I a member of this club?
L615395 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Will be--as soon as the ship sails.
L615394 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Are you happy?
L615393 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
L616411 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ You don't shoot squirrels.
L616410 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Meaning what?
L616409 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
L616408 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
L616407 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
L616406 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ What do you mean?
L616405 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
L616533 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Good-night, folks.
L616532 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--
L616123 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--
L616122 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?
L615984 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots.
L615983 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
L615513 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--
L615512 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Is that one of the Who's Who?
L615511 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!
L615510 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
L615509 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
L615508 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Get that out of your trunk.
L615507 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ So what?
L615506 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ --And he has sex appeal.
L615505 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
L615504 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Well, he has a straw hat--
L615503 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ What's he got that I haven't got?
L615502 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
L615501 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
L615500 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ With your dry wit and humor--
L615352 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--
L615351 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
L615350 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
L615349 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
L615348 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
L615347 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!
L615345 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--
L615344 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
L615343 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
L615342 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm getting seasick--
L615341 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ What's the matter, Mary?
L615340 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
L615339 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Very good, Mary--
L615338 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
L615337 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Well, let's hear the poem--
L615336 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Somebody's got to do it--
L615335 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
L615334 +++$+++ u8471 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
L615333 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
L616210 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Easy kid--easy....  Come on--I want to talk to you.
L616209 +++$+++ u8473 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
L616208 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ What for?
L616207 +++$+++ u8473 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?
L616206 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ What happened to you?
L615591 +++$+++ u8473 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ No--but I'm going to keep my eye on--
L615590 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
L615589 +++$+++ u8473 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
L615588 +++$+++ u8469 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ DENBY +++$+++ Then, after the first number, I tell the one about the Scotchman trying to open a Pullman window--the Scotchman says to the window--"Gee you're tight."-- and the window says--"You loosen up a bit and so will I."--Good?--And then I do the one--  Oh--you don't like it, eh?
L615929 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later.
L615928 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ I went for four.
L615927 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ About twelve hundred.
L615926 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ How much did you lose?
L615913 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.

L615676 +++$+++ u8478 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SUMMERS +++$+++ There's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin' for a fly.  I've already been workin' on a young fellow from Chicago--related to one of the big packin' families--on his way to Biarritz for a good time. Likes a little game of bridge and poker.
L615675 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ He works the boats as a "come-on" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.

L616194 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
L616193 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
L616192 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--

L615976 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You can't bluff me any more.
L615975 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
