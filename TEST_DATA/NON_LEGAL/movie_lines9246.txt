L364503 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ That's what Mama used to say.
L364502 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.
L364501 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ What do you do with your time?
L364500 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ Don't con me.
L364499 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Okay, okay.
L364498 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ Don't con me. Don't try...
L364497 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
L364496 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.
L364495 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ You the only cat don't come on with that "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
L364494 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
L364493 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay?
L364492 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ What you sniffing around for? I told you I gave you your last fix.
L364488 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ Elijah Muhammad can get you out of prison. Out of the prison of your mind. Maybe all you want is another fix. I thought you were smart.
L364487 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Elijah who?
L364486 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light.
L364484 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ I thought you was smart. But you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you. Like a monkey. And the white man sees you and he laughs. He laughs because he knows you ain't white.
L364483 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Man, I don't want to hear all that.
L364482 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all that poison into your hair, into your body -- trying to be white.
L364480 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
L364479 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Leggo. I got to wash it out.
L364478 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I ain't said I'm ashamed.
L364477 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
L364476 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
L364475 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ Why? Why does everybody conk?
L364474 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
L364473 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ Putting all that poison in your hair.
L364472 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ When you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. Cause that's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you.
L364471 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ You ain't lying.
L364467 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ 'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
L364466 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ What did you give it to me for then?
L364465 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
L364464 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
L364463 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
L364462 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?
L364460 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Man, get outa my face. I ain't nobody's punk.
L364459 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
L364458 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Man, what do you want?
L364457 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
L364456 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Who the hell are you?
L364867 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be exact.
L364866 +++$+++ u1959 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BENJAMIN +++$+++ I'll have it tomorrow.
L364797 +++$+++ u1959 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BENJAMIN +++$+++ Mr. X, I won't make you out a liar.
L364796 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ We need more young warriors like yourself, stick around and we shall see if your heart is true.
L364795 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I admire your enthusiasm but you should never join any organization without first checking it out thoroughly.
L364794 +++$+++ u1959 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BENJAMIN +++$+++ Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
L364793 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Do you?
L364791 +++$+++ u1959 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BENJAMIN +++$+++ Mr. X, I was out there tonight. I saw what you did. I want to be a Muslim. I ain't never seen a Negro stand up to the police like that.
L364790 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ What can I do for you?
L365084 +++$+++ u1960 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BENJAMIN 2X +++$+++ And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you --
L365083 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Make it plain.
L365066 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Has the Reverend called? Is he going to show?
L365065 +++$+++ u1960 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BENJAMIN 2X +++$+++ Next week, Brother Minister.
L365064 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program.
L365062 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Why not? You've had ample time, you and the sister.
L365061 +++$+++ u1960 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BENJAMIN 2X +++$+++ No, Brother Minister.
L365060 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Is the program ready?
L364875 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Come, sit with us.
L364874 +++$+++ u1960 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BENJAMIN 2X +++$+++ All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
L364873 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ You are now Benjamin 2X.
L365047 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I don't think that's such a good idea.
L365046 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
L365045 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
L365044 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Dear heart, where are you?
L365043 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
L365042 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
L365041 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Betty it's me. It's me.
L365040 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
L365011 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ We had the best organization that black people ever had and niggers ruined it.
L365010 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Dear heart, I love you.
L365009 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.
L365008 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Shhh!
L365007 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband or father.
L365006 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ You have to sleep for three.
L365005 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Get some sleep.
L364933 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Open your eyes, you can face death 24 hours a day; but the possibility of betrayal never enters your mind. If you won't do that for yourself do it for us.
L364932 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ What do you want me to do?
L364931 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ We need you too!
L364930 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
L364929 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Dear heart, you have to help me. I'm raising our kids practically by myself, while you're running all over the world. You don't know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home?
L364928 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind?
L364927 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
L364926 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
L364925 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
L364924 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
L364923 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
L364922 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
L364921 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
L364920 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own.
L364919 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
L364918 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
L364917 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
L364916 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ "Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."
L364915 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
L364914 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ "Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."
L364913 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
L364912 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
L364911 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ The talk is everywhere!
L364910 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Talk about what?
L364909 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
L364908 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I just want to sit here and be still.
L364907 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm not made of glass.
L364906 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.
L364904 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ How do you know?
L364903 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Because you're in trouble.
L364902 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Why are you looking at me like that?
L364828 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ The simplest thing in the world: I want to have a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love you.
L364827 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ What do you think?
L364826 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.
L364825 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You're with me even when you're away.
L364824 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I'll be away a lot.
L364823 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Hush your mouth.
L364822 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ It will be rough.
L364821 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Just hold me.
L364820 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ It won't be easy.
L364819 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I love you.
L364818 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Yes. Did you eat?
L364817 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I think so. Can you catch a plane?
L364816 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
L364815 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Did you hear what I said?
L364814 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Yes.
L364813 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ At a gas station.  Will you marry me?
L364812 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I know.
L364811 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I'm in Detroit.
L364738 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Being a good Muslim, a good nurse and a good wife.
L364737 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ What have you set your mind to?
L364736 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ And dogged when I set my mind to something.
L364735 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Are you?
L364734 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
L364733 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ How old are you, Betty?
L364732 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a tall man.
L364731 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ If it's just idle, I won't answer it.
L364730 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Just an idle question.
L364729 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Why do you ask?
L364728 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?
L364727 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You have enough worries of your own.
L364726 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
L364725 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I can handle it.
L364724 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
L364723 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
L364722 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
L364721 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ There's nothing to talk about.
L364720 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Let's talk about you for a change.
L364719 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Delicious.
L364718 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ How do you like it?
L364717 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
L364716 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What?
L364715 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.
L364713 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You've been on your feet for days. And didn't even finish your salad.
L364712 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
L364711 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Could we sit down someplace?
L364710 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.
L364709 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I see your point.
L364705 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Let me explain. No. I'll do better than that. I'll show it to you. Scientifically. But it's demonstration purely in the interest of science, you understand?
L364704 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Considering today's standards of animal raising and curing meats, I don't fully understand the restriction on pork.
L364701 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ That you haven't time for either marriage or eating --
L364700 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ What points?
L364697 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage?
L364696 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson, the strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms.
L364693 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ If you want to tell me.
L364692 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
L364690 +++$+++ u1961 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ She ate.
L364689 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ What?
L365079 +++$+++ u1962 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BROTHER EARL +++$+++ Down front as always.
L365078 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Is my family here yet?
L365077 +++$+++ u1962 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BROTHER EARL +++$+++ Let's cancel.
L365076 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
L365075 +++$+++ u1962 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BROTHER EARL +++$+++ Brother Minister, what is wrong?
L365072 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ What did I tell you about assuming?
L365071 +++$+++ u1962 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BROTHER EARL +++$+++ I assumed...
L365070 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else.
L365069 +++$+++ u1962 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BROTHER EARL +++$+++ I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
L365068 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
L365067 +++$+++ u1962 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BROTHER EARL +++$+++ Reverend Chickenwing called last night and said he wouldn't be able to attend.
L365038 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I don't want folks to be searched, it makes people uncomfortable. If I can't be safe among my own kind, where can I be? Allah will protect me.
L365037 +++$+++ u1962 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BROTHER EARL +++$+++ I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
L365036 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
L365035 +++$+++ u1962 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BROTHER EARL +++$+++ Let some of us come down there.
L365034 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.
L365033 +++$+++ u1962 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BROTHER EARL +++$+++ Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.
L365032 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Brother Earl.
L365025 +++$+++ u1962 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BROTHER EARL +++$+++ Let's get out of this cold.
L365024 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I don't care about myself, my wife and four children were sleeping in their beds, they have nothing to do with this.
L364787 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ That's enough, Brother Earl.
L364786 +++$+++ u1962 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BROTHER EARL +++$+++ I'm tired of praying.
L364785 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.
L364628 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black.
L364627 +++$+++ u1963 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ CHAPLAIN GILL +++$+++ Just what are you saying?
L364626 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
L364625 +++$+++ u1963 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ CHAPLAIN GILL +++$+++ Now just a moment, just a moment --
L364624 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Then we don't know that God was white.
L364623 +++$+++ u1963 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ CHAPLAIN GILL +++$+++ I told you we don't know for certain.
L364622 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ What color were the original Hebrews?
L364621 +++$+++ u1963 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ CHAPLAIN GILL +++$+++ Just what is your question?
L364620 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
L364619 +++$+++ u1963 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ CHAPLAIN GILL +++$+++ That's right.
L364618 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ They were Hebrew, weren't they?
L364617 +++$+++ u1963 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ CHAPLAIN GILL +++$+++ I don't think we know for certain.
L364616 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
L364615 +++$+++ u1963 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ CHAPLAIN GILL +++$+++ Why don't you just ask your question?
L364450 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.
