L57747 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
L57746 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ That's what we were working on.
L57745 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ But if someone miniaturized the process...
L57744 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
L57743 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
L57742 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
L57741 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Is there anything that isn't?
L57740 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Not quite. This is my field.
L57733 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
L57732 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ But
L57713 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
L57712 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ For you, Mrs. Peel.
L57701 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ She had this in her mouth. There, there...
L57700 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
L57699 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Is that written in his shoe?
L57698 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
L57697 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Any ideas?
L57696 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ What on earth?
L57694 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Very good, Steed ...
L57693 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
L57692 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ How on earth can you tell?
L57691 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
L57678 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.
L57677 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
L57676 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You mean my other self ...
L57675 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I must say, you look more your old self --
L57674 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Did you say formal? I must dress.
L57673 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
L57672 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this.
L57671 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Did he say who?
L57670 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
L57669 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
L57668 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
L57667 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Frankly that's how I remember it.
L57666 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
L57665 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Why should they think that?
L57664 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.
L57663 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I might say the same.
L57662 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
L57661 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I wasn't about to.
L57660 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
L57659 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Strange.
L57658 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You should be dead.  How do you feel?
L57657 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?
L57632 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Small talk.  Try the weather.
L57631 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
L57630 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ All of a piece, really. A fanatical weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY.  British Royal Organisation For Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British weather has been tampered with by ... aliens.
L57629 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Any other vices?
L57628 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
L57627 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ June, July ... August?
L57626 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie.
L57625 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ An eccentric recluse?
L57624 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...
L57623 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I meant me.
L57622 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ No thanks.
L57621 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
L57620 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
L57619 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
L57618 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
L57617 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ For a man in my position --
L57616 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
L57615 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ As per mother's instructions.
L57614 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
L57612 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know.
L57611 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
L57610 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ And I suppose you're the knight.
L57609 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
L57608 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ But why? What's the point?
L57607 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
L57606 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?
L57603 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Do you really think so?
L57602 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
L57601 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Thank you, Trubshaw ...
L57600 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
L57599 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?
L57598 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Steed, we really must be --
L57595 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Or half cocked.
L57594 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
L57593 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I thought we were on our way.
L57592 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Yes indeed. I need protection.
L57591 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Do you?
L57589 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I had a feeling you would. Touche!
L57588 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Really?  I fail to see the connection.
L57587 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ My father always wanted a boy.
L57548 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
L57547 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.
L57537 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
L57536 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ ... Showers followed by sunny periods.
L57525 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Mother?
L57524 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I didn't. Mother did.
L57523 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
L57522 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Much better.
L57521 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
L57520 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
L57519 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ And just what is the game?
L57518 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
L57517 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Rules are made to be broken.
L57516 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
L57515 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Whereas you are.
L57514 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
L57513 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ So what was all this -- some sort of test?
L57512 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
L57511 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ 1922. Why the kippers?
L57510 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
L57509 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I had a spot of bother at the door.
L57508 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I was about to throw in the towel.
L57507 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
L57506 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Doctor Peel, I presume?
L58076 +++$+++ u381 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ And you've a new wardrobe. He does want you to look attractive.  He tells me you're very beautiful.
L58075 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Decontamination -- ?
L58074 +++$+++ u381 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.
L57731 +++$+++ u381 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here.
L57730 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You don't believe him?
L57726 +++$+++ u381 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
L57725 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Where's Mother?
L57563 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You're saying I have no choice.
L57562 +++$+++ u381 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
L57555 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
L57554 +++$+++ u381 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
L58054 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
L58053 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ You're not venturing alone, surely.
L58052 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I shall need a small plane.
L58051 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
L58050 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
L58049 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ Privately owned by ...
L58048 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ ... and now?
L58047 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ 'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
L57989 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Well, I can't possibly go like this.
L57988 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
L57985 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I fail to see --
L57984 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
L57983 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Getting to what?
L57982 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ I was getting to it.
L57978 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.
L57977 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ Makes two of us.
L57976 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Who's now vanished.
L57975 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
L57974 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Surveillance? By whom?
L57973 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
L57972 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I know all this.
L57971 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...
L57970 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ Half-brother to be precise.
L57969 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Peter's brother?  But --
L57968 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.
L57966 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?
L57965 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I see.
L57964 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.
L58129 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
L58128 +++$+++ u381 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
L58127 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
L58126 +++$+++ u381 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
L58125 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ How did you guess?
L58124 +++$+++ u381 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Steed
L58011 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Dead, I'm afraid.
L58010 +++$+++ u381 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ We want Mrs. Peel.
L58009 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Oh, hello ...
L57729 +++$+++ u381 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ So you say ...
L57728 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.
L57551 +++$+++ u381 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?
L57550 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Global warming?
L57549 +++$+++ u381 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
L58064 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
L58063 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ In your operation.
L58062 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Where?
L58061 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
L58060 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
L58059 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I was hoping you could tell me.
L57898 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Mother and Father know best.
L57897 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Guilty until proven innocent?
L57896 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --
L57885 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...
L57884 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?
L57838 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.
L57837 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ This man -- did you see him?
L57739 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Impossible.
L57738 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
L57737 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
L57583 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ You.
L57582 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Anyone particular in mind?
L57581 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.
L57578 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?
L57577 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.
L57573 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ She may try to kill you.
L57572 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Why?
L57571 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
L57570 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Insane ... ?
L57569 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Possibly. Split personality ...
L57568 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Amnesia?
L57567 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
L57566 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Think she really killed those agents?
