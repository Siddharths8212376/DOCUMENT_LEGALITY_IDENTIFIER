L580604 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ ...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
L580603 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Something's wrong...  I'm having -- lancinating pain -- my chest. My... motor functions are being affected. I'm...
L580602 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Scully...
L580600 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ I think... something stung me.
L580599 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ What? What happened?
L580597 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
L580596 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
L580594 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ You don't Mulder -- you've never needed me. I've only held you back.  I've got to go.
L580593 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ I need you on this, Scully --
L580592 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
L580591 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Just like that --
L580590 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ I have. I did. It's done.
L580589 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --
L580588 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
L580587 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
L580586 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --
L580585 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ You can't quit, Scully.
L580584 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.
L580583 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
L580582 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ What? What's wrong?
L580541 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ I don't know.
L580540 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Where'd they go?
L580534 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Come on!
L580533 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ What are you doing?
L580532 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Run.
L580531 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Yeah...?
L580530 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Scully....?
L580528 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Maybe. Maybe not.
L580527 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
L580526 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ You hear that?
L580524 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ For the purpose of what?
L580523 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.
L580522 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.
L580521 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
L580520 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Very weird.
L580519 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ This is weird, Mulder.
L580518 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ I have no idea.
L580517 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ What do you think it is?
L580516 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
L580515 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Been where?
L580514 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
L580513 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ It may be extraterrestrial.
L580512 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Mulder --
L580511 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ This virus -- it... 
L580510 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
L580509 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Yeah, well they may this one.
L580508 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
L580507 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
L580506 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ -- of what exactly?!
L580505 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
L580504 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
L580503 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ What?
L580502 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ This is great. This is fitting.
L580501 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
L580499 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ I don't know why I think they went right.
L580498 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ You think they went left?
L580497 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.
L580496 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Where would they be going?
L580495 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
L580494 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ What are my choices?
L580493 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
L580492 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ And where are they going with it?
L580491 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ I don't know, Mulder.
L580490 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
L580472 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks.
L580471 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ All the equipment is brand new.
L580470 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
L580469 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ It looks pretty green for this climate.
L580468 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ This looks like new grass to you?
L580467 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
L580466 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ And you've never seen anything like that?
L580465 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
L580464 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?
L580463 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ I don't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm drain.
L580462 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
L580461 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ He didn't mention a park.
L580394 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
L580393 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ How was it contracted?
L580392 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
L580391 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ What did you find?
L580390 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
L580389 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ You said you weren't coming?
L580378 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --
L580377 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ -- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
L580376 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ I've got a hearing tomorrow --
L580375 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
L580374 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Mulder --
L580373 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
L580372 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ I don't know.
L580371 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ What kind of infection?
L580370 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Evidence of a massive infection.
L580369 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ What did you find?
L580368 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ I can't really talk right now.
L580367 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Why are you whispering?
L580319 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
L580318 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
L580317 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
L580316 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
L580315 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ I'd been told as much.
L580314 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
L580313 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ I don't know what killed this man. I'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either.
L580312 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
L580311 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
L580310 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
L580309 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ It's like jelly.
L580304 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ And you're looking for?
L580303 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ According to this tag.
L580302 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
L580270 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
L580269 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Mulder -- what are you doing?
L580268 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Get dressed, Scully.
L580267 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Go home, Mulder. It's late.
L580266 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Is that what you'd like me to do?
L580265 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
L580264 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ What are you implying, Scully?
L580263 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Is that before or after you got the idea to come here?
L580262 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ I was until about an hour ago.
L580261 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Are you drunk, Mulder?
L580260 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Why not? It's three AM.
L580259 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ No.
L580258 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ I wake you?
L580206 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
L580205 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ You're... quitting?
L580204 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.
L580203 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
L580202 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
L580201 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ They were the ones that put us together.
L580200 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
L580199 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Why?
L580198 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
L580197 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ What? What are you talking about?
L580196 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
L580195 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
L580194 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ All I told them was the truth.
L580193 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
L580164 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ -- Mulder! Get in the car!
L580163 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Something's not right...
L580148 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
L580147 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Scully?
L580140 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there.
L580139 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ ...thirteen fifty six...
L580138 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
L580137 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
L580134 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Nice try, Mulder.
L580133 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Scully, get somebody to open this door.
L580131 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ I'm in the vending room.
L580130 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Where are you, Mulder?
L580129 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Scully, I found the bomb.
L580128 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Scully...
L580126 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Something sweet.
L580125 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?
L580124 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ I just did. You're buying.
L580123 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
L580122 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.
L580121 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Oh yeah. Had you big time.
L580120 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ No you didn't.
L580119 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Had you.
L580117 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ It's locked?
L580116 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Now what?
L580115 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome.
L580114 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.
L580113 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ How's that?
L580112 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.
L580110 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
L580109 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Jesus, Mulder...
L580108 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ What happened to playing a hunch?
L580107 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Mulder...?
L580106 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb. The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. If you'd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device. If we don't act in accordance with that data -- if you ignore it as we have done -- the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it. Lives could be lost --
L580105 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ I think they have that covered.
L580104 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
L580103 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ You're looking for a bomb.
L580102 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
L580101 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ What's wrong, Scully?
L580100 +++$+++ u8198 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SCULLY +++$+++ No. I haven't.
L580099 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ Did you find something?

L580297 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ They can patch you in through the switchboard.
L580296 +++$+++ u8202 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ YOUNG NAVAL GUARD +++$+++ I don't have his number.

L580291 +++$+++ u8197 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ MULDER +++$+++ On whose orders?

L580640 +++$+++ u8199 +++$+++ m556 +++$+++ SKINNER +++$+++ I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
