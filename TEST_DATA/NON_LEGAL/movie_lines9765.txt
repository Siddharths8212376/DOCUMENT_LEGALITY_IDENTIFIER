L175902 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ From outer space!  It's science- fiction.  <u>Very</u> big with the kids! If you make this picture, you'll have enough money to finance a HUNDRED religious films!  <u>And</u> pay my back rent from the profits.
L175901 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
L175900 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ "Graverobbers From Outer Space"! It's <u>money in the bank</u>.
L175899 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Absolutely!  You see this script..?
L175898 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Would that work?
L175897 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
L175896 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Oh!  Our church has the money for one film.  We just don't have it for all twelve...
L175895 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Raising money is tough.
L175894 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ <u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
L175893 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You could say that --
L175892 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Hmm, so you're in the picture business?
L175891 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'm real sorry.  My stockbroker must have transferred the wrong account... C'mon in, I'll write you another one.
L175890 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
L175889 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah...?
L175888 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Mr. Wood, this is Mr. Reynolds, your landlord.  Could you please open up?
L175887 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hruphh...?
L175886 +++$+++ u4952 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ REYNOLDS +++$+++ Mr. Wood?!
L175854 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ We're escaping!
L175853 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ What is happening?
L175828 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Don't worry.  We're almost there.
L175827 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ My eyes are killink me.
L175656 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ Forget her!  Move on.  A good lookink boy like you as you can have any girl you wish.
L175655 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But I thought me and Dolores had something.
L175654 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ My friend, you tink Greta is first woman I ever see?  No!  Many duds, before I find her.
L175653 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.
L175652 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Tor, I should be getting home.
L175645 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ Don't worry.  You just haven't met right woman yet.  Oopsy.  That cabbage goes right through me.
L175644 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family.
L175643 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ The food will make you feel bedder. Look at me -- I'm da happiest guy I know!
L175642 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
L175641 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ Hey!  You're not eatink.
L175425 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ Okey-dokey.
L175424 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Here's the scene.  Loretta, you're in a trance.  You glide in and get on the operating table.  Now Tor, you're supposed to tie her down.  But you have an angora fetish... and when you rub that swatch of angora, it makes you refuse so Bela has to discipline you.
L175399 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ But Greta say --
L175398 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Tor, dialogue is overrated.  You look at the classic film actors, who are they?  Fairbanks.  Chaplin.  They didn't talk!  They did it all with their face.
L175397 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ Bela, he talk.  Loretta, she talk. But Tor, he no talk.
L175396 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
L175395 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk.
L175394 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Really?  Was the third act too intense?
L175393 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ Edvard!   I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read.  And she no like.
L175262 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hopefully, very soon.  I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM.
L175261 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ I like.  When do movie shoot?
L175260 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So anyway, I've got this new script, "Bride Of The Atom," and there's a part you're ideal for: "Lobo."  He's tough.  A brute.  But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl.
L175254 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Nah, that doesn't matter!  It's a visual medium.
L175253 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
L175252 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
L175251 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ No.  With hair, yah.  But I must shave head for wrestlink.  It scare da crowds.  Dey like that.
L175250 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I think you're quite handsome.
L175249 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ Mm, not good-lookink enough.
L175248 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
L175247 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ Tor!
L175246 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So, Mr. Johnson --
L175245 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh, of course!
L175244 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ Could we moovf to table?
L175243 +++$+++ u4954 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ TOR +++$+++ Da pleasure be mine.
L175242 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Glad you could fit me in your schedule.
L176032 +++$+++ u4949 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ORSON WELLES +++$+++ It is when it works.  You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch?  "Kane."  The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame.  Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?
L176031 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?
L176030 +++$+++ u4949 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ORSON WELLES +++$+++ Tell me about it.  I'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal, and they want Charlton Heston to play a <u>Mexican</u>!
L176029 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
L176028 +++$+++ u4949 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ORSON WELLES +++$+++ Ugh, I hate when that happens.
L176027 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
L176026 +++$+++ u4949 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ORSON WELLES +++$+++ It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
L176025 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I can't believe it.  These sound like <u>my</u> problems!
L176024 +++$+++ u4949 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ORSON WELLES +++$+++ Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on "Don Quixote." So I'm trying to finish a promo for something else.  But I can't find the soundtrack --  I think I left it in Malta.
L176023 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?
L176022 +++$+++ u4949 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ORSON WELLES +++$+++ My pleasure.  I'm Orson Welles.
L176021 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
L176020 +++$+++ u4949 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ORSON WELLES +++$+++ Yes?
L176019 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Excuse me, Sir...?
L175228 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ "Your movie"?!  I wish it was your movie!  I wish I hadn't blown every dime I ever made into this stinkbomb. If I ever see you again, I'll kill you!!!
L175227 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You can't talk that way about my movie.
L175226 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Screw you, Wood!  I even sunk more money into different titles: "Transvestite" "He Or She?" "I Led Two Lives"... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit.
L175225 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Maybe it needs special handling.
L175224 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Because I can't sell it to save my life!  You made a goddamn feathered fish.  Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick?  Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it.
L175223 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Why not??
L175222 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ "Where's the ads"?!  The ads are in Alabama, Indiana, and Missouri!  You schmuck, it ain't gonna play L.A.!
L175158 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ I did.  I established some tits and ass.
L175157 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Georgie, what's with the stag footage??  You said you were cutting in <u>establishing shots</u>!
L175152 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Yeah??  Well Orson Welles didn't wear angora sweaters, did he??!
L175151 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But I'm proud.  I wrote, directed, and starred in it just like Orson Welles in "Citizen Kane"!
L175150 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ And you did a bang-up job, too.  But you don't want other producers to know that's you in drag.  Trust me. It's a career killer.
L175149 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Why?!  I did all those things!  Hell, I even built the props.
L175148 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
L175147 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Um, I guess --
L175146 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ They'll notice.  Look, why don't you let me take over from here?  I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...
L175145 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Gee, I used every frame of film we shot.  Maybe they won't notice.
L175144 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Ed, what was the one thing I asked you to do?  Make it <u>seven reels long</u>. I've got contracts with my exhibitors.  If it ain't over an hour, they won't play it.
L175143 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
L175142 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
L175108 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
L175107 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ <u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
L175106 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
L175105 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
L175083 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So change the poster.  Trust me, you'll be better off.  This is a story that's gonna <u>grab</u> people.  It's about this guy.  He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  Should he tell her? Should he not tell her?  He's torn. George, this is DRAMA.
L175082 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
L175081 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I don't think he's a schmuck.
L175080 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
L175079 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ There's still a sex-change --
L175078 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film!
L175045 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Because he's <u>my friend</u>.
L175044 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick?
L175043 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Uh, yeah.  Our picture.
L175042 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ OUR picture?
L175041 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No, he's not dead!  He lives in Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
L175040 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Isn't he dead?
L175039 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
L175038 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Lugosi?
L175037 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Who?
L175036 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What if I told you you could have a star for $1000??
L175035 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Fine, maybe you're right.  But it doesn't friggin' matter.  I can't afford a star, so I don't even know what we're talking about.
L175034 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No!  It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
L175033 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Yeah.  Crap with a star.
L175032 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
L175031 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Eddie, you must have me confused with David Selznick.  I don't make major motion pictures.  I make crap.
L175030 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No.  Better than tits -- a <u>star</u>!
L175029 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Tits.
L175028 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin' about what you said, about how all your movies have to make a profit.  And I realized, what's the one thing, that if you put in a movie, it'll be successful??
L174940 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah.  I know what it's like to live with a secret, and worry about what people are gonna think of you... My girlfriend still doesn't know why her sweaters are always stretched out.
L174939 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ And this is why you think you're the most qualified to make my movie?
L174938 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Confidentially, I even paratrooped wearing a brassiere and panties. I'll tell ya, I wasn't scared of being killed, but I was <u>terrified</u> of getting wounded, and having the medics discover my secret.
L174937 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ You gotta be kiddin' me.
L174936 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2.  'Course, I <u>was</u> wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.
L174935 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ So you're not a fruit?
L174934 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
L174933 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Are you a fruit?
L174932 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well, Mr. Weiss, I've never told anyone what I'm about to tell you... but I really want this job.  I like to dress in women's clothing.
L174931 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Hmm.  There's five-hundred guys in town who can tell me the same thing. You said on the phone you had some kind of "special qualifications."
L174930 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
L174929 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.
L174928 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Fuck no!  But there's a poster.
L174927 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Is there a script?
L174926 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ No, of COURSE I'm gonna make the movie!  I've already preósold Alabama and Oklahoma.  Those repressed Okies really go for that twisted pervert stuff.  So we'll just make it without that she-male.  We'll fictitionalize it.
L174925 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So you're not gonna make the movie?
L174924 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
L174923 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
L174922 +++$+++ u4943 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ GEORGIE +++$+++ Can I help you?
L176066 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So?  It's only a five-hour drive. And it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert.  Heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner.  I promise.
L176065 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!
L176064 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ <u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!
L176063 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Huh?!
L176062 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Let's get married.
L176061 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Ed, I'm so happy for you.
L176057 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ C'mon!  Let's just go.
L176056 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
L176055 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I can't get it to go up.
L175942 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ My chiropractor!
L175941 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Who's Dr. Tom?
L175940 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!
L175936 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hell, if I did, I wouldn't have any friends.
L175935 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ You should feel lucky.  Ed's the only guy in town who doesn't pass judgment on people.
L175930 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah...  I should give her a call.
L175929 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ The poor girl's out of a job.
L175928 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Those assholes.
L175926 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yes!  BINGO!  Solar energy!  Oh that's gonna seem so scientific.  This movie's gonna be the ultimate Ed Wood film.  <u>No compromises</u>.
L175925 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ The sun.
L175924 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy??
L175923 +++$+++ u4945 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Dynamite --
