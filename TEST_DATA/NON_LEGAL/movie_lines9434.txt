L593678 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him.  I really needed him.
L593649 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ OK, but then I agree with Tessio. You're going about it all wrong; you're making the move out of weakness... Barzini's a wolf, and if he tears you apart, the other families won't come running to help the Corleones...
L593648 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
L593647 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Mike, why am I out?
L593646 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Not so perfectly if you noticed.
L593645 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Bookkeepers know everything. Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing.  They get a little more money than the job's worth.  Lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly.
L593642 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about Rocco Lampone building a secret regime.  Why does Neri report directly to you, rather than through me or a caporegime?
L593641 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.
L593640 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?
L593303 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey.  We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.
L593302 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ What about McCluskey?
L593049 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Right.
L593048 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
L593047 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Sure.  Anything I can do for you.
L592929 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Thanks Tom.
L592928 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Hello Kay.  Your father's inside, doing some business.  He's been asking for you.
L593747 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Is it true?
L593746 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
L593745 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Tell me!
L593744 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Don't ask me.
L593743 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.
L593614 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Let me think about it, O.K.?
L593613 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Will you?
L593612 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Connie and Carlo want you to be godfather to their little boy.
L593611 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'm busy.
L593610 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Why are you so cold to her and Carlo?  They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.
L593608 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Let HER ask.
L593607 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Your sister wants to ask you something.
L593606 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Wake me up when you come to bed?
L593605 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
L593604 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Don't you want dinner first?
L593603 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets.
L593602 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Oh Michael.
L593601 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I have to see my father and his people when we get back to the Mall.
L593244 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Goodbye.
L593243 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ When will I see you again?
L593242 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I want you to go back to New Hampshire...think things over.
L593241 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ When will I see you again?
L593240 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I don't think so either.  I better go.
L593239 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ My parents don't read the Daily News.  All right, if you think I shouldn't.  I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.
L593238 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
L593237 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Can I go to the hospital with you?
L593236 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
L593226 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ OK. 
L593225 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
L593224 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Please say it.
L593223 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I can't...
L593222 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Tell me you love me.
L593221 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Huh?
L593220 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Can you say it?
L593219 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Yeah Kay, I'm here.
L593218 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I LOVE YOU.
L593217 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I love you.
L593216 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ He'll be OK.
L593215 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ How is your father?
L593214 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Hello.  Kay?
L593067 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No, I would not like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman.
L593066 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Michael...
L593065 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'm thinking about it.
L593064 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Michael?
L593063 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Would you like me better if I were Ingrid Bergman?
L593062 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No.
L593061 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Would you like me better if I were a nun?
L593045 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Hello...this is Long Distance.  I have a call from New Hampshire.  Mr. Michael Corleone.  One moment please.
L593044 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
L593043 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Michael, what are you doing?
L593041 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.
L593040 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Michael.
L593039 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
L593038 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ What time do they expect us?
L593037 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
L593036 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ What will your father say?
L593034 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Just you.
L593033 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ And what do you want for Christmas?
L593032 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen...
L592953 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.
L592952 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
L592951 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Sure.
L592950 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
L592931 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in.  He's a good lawyer.
L592930 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
L592927 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ My brother, Tom Hagen.
L592926 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ How do you do.
L592925 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.
L592924 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ He's coming over here!
L592923 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I told you you wouldn't like him.
L592922 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I never know when you're telling me the truth.
L592921 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ ...who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated.
L592920 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Michael, I love you.
L592919 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Then Luca turned to the other man...
L592918 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
L592917 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
L592916 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Michael you're trying to scare me...
L592915 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Then the legs at the knees...
L592914 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Michael...
L592913 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
L592912 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Al Capone!
L592911 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Once upon a time, about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business.  They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did.
L592910 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Then eat your spaghetti and I'll tell you a Luca Brasi story.
L592909 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ You know I love spaghetti.
L592908 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You like spaghetti?
L592907 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Yes.  Tell me.
L592906 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You really want to know?
L592905 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Who is he?
L592904 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You wouldn't like him.
L592898 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.
L592897 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Why do they bother him on a day like this?
L592896 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
L592895 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ They're talking to themselves.
L592894 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ They're waiting to see my father.
L592893 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Michael, what are those men doing?
L592892 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I told you I had a lot of relatives.
L592891 +++$+++ u3104 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I've never seen anything like it.
L593259 +++$+++ u3108 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ We don't have to disconnect them, we can wheel the stand with the bed.
L593258 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You've read about my father in the papers.  You've seen that no one's here to guard him.  Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him.  Believe me and help me.
L593257 +++$+++ u3108 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ Absolutely not!  We have to get permission from the Doctor.
L593256 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
L593255 +++$+++ u3108 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.
L593251 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You just stand here one minute...
L593250 +++$+++ u3108 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ Oh your father just had too many visitors.  It interfered with the hospital service.  The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.  But don't worry.  I look in on him.
L593249 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father.  What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
L593329 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Probably a year...
L593328 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back?
L593316 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign.
L593315 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ A million times.
L593314 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ What are you, inspecting the barracks?  You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
L593313 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up.
L593305 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ They want me to go to the conference with Sollozzo.  Set up the meeting for two days from now.  Sonny, get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held. Insist it has to be a public place: a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour.  So I'll feel safe.  They'll check me when I meet them so I won't be able to carry a weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a way to have one planted there for me.  Then I'll kill them both.
L593304 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Go on Mike.
L593301 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ The kid's right.
L593300 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ We can't wait.  No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop.  You have to get Sollozzo now.
L593285 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ The Turk wants to talk!  The nerve of that son of a bitch!  After he craps out last night he wants a meet.
L593284 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Cut it out.
L593283 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Mikey, you look beautiful!
L593254 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I won't panic.
L593253 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and don't panic.
L593252 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital.  I came down late.  There's no one here.  None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one.  The old man is completely unprotected.
L593233 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just going to see Pop in the hospital. Also, I got other things.
L593232 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Send some bodyguards.
L593231 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ To the city.
L593230 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Where are you going?
L593156 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Is it like they say?  Is he that good?
L593155 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
L593154 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ All right, Sonny.  All right.
L593153 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
L593152 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ That's not how Pop would have played it.
L593151 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.
L593150 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
L593149 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Until the old man tells me different.
L593148 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
L593147 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building.  We got people in the phone company.  Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad.
L593146 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ How can you be sure?
L593145 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
L593144 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.
L593143 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ One of them fingered the old man.
L593142 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What?
L593141 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ All right, Mikey...who do we have to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?
L593140 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Theresa.
L593139 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
L593138 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
L593137 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I can help you out...
L593136 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Good.  She's been through it before. Me too.  You were too young to know about it.  You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.
L593135 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ How's Mom?
L593134 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.
L593348 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Is it all right if I go to the bathroom?
L593347 +++$+++ u3111 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SOLLOZZO +++$+++ What is it?
L593346 +++$+++ u3111 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SOLLOZZO +++$+++ What guarantees can I give you?  I am the hunted one.  I've missed my chance.  You think too highly of me, my friend...I am not so clever...all I want if a truce...
L593345 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Most important...I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life.
L593339 +++$+++ u3111 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SOLLOZZO +++$+++ Maybe.
L593338 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ We're going to New Jersey?
L593335 +++$+++ u3111 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SOLLOZZO +++$+++ He won't be; I swear to you be my children he won't be.  Just keep an open mind when we talk.  I hope you're not a hothead like your brother, Sonny.  It's impossible to talk business with him.
L593334 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I want to settle things tonight.  I want my father left alone.
L593333 +++$+++ u3111 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SOLLOZZO +++$+++ I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we can straighten everything out.  All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all. It should never have happened.

L593675 +++$+++ u3113 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ TESSIO +++$+++ Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
L593631 +++$+++ u3113 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ TESSIO +++$+++ Forgive me, Godfather, let our years of friendship be my excuse. How can you hope for success there without your strength here to back you up?  The two  go hand in hand. And with you gone from here the Barzini and the Tattaglias will be too strong for us.
L593630 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No.  I want things very calm for another six months.

L593595 +++$+++ u3106 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MOE +++$+++ Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink.

L593590 +++$+++ u3106 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MOE +++$+++ The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
L593589 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
L593588 +++$+++ u3106 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MOE +++$+++ You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
