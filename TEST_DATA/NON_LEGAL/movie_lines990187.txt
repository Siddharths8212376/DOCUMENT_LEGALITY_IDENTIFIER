L434322 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Why are you mad?
L434321 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.
L434320 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I'm just going to the bathroom.
L434319 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ You coming back?
L434314 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Don't talk like that, okay?  You scare me.
L434313 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
L434312 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I don't think we should get into that.
L434311 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ So she did help you?
L434310 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ To warn her about Chino.
L434309 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You were going to see her?
L434308 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Outside Adele's.
L434307 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Where?
L434306 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ You know I saw you on the street.
L434305 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Really?  I was thinking the same thing. If we could call time and get together for a while.
L434304 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
L434303 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I wasn't sure you caught that.
L434302 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You waved to me in the elevator.
L434301 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I don't know.  I hadn't worked that part out yet.  All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.
L434300 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What were you gonna do with me?
L434298 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Why not?
L434297 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You believe that?
L434296 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I hear he didn't mean to.  The cop fell as Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart.
L434295 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ He killed a police officer.
L434294 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.
L434293 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Yeah, but in a nice way.
L434292 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
L434291 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ She did, huh.
L434290 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Remember how talkative you were?  In the trunk?  Adele said you do that when you're nervous.
L434289 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ That's not what you were about to say.
L434288 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You really wear that suit.
L434285 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ So do you.
L434284 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You like taking risks.
L434283 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ It would be worth the risk.
L434282 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
L434281 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
L434280 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
L434279 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I called your room from downstairs.
L434278 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Oh, God...
L434275 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Or once.
L434274 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.
L434273 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Well, does it make sense to you?
L434272 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ It's not a game.  Something you play.
L434271 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ It's your game.  I've never played this before.
L434270 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I don't think it works if we're somebody else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?
L434269 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Not yet.  Don't say anything yet.  Okay?
L434268 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ How far do we go with this?
L434267 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
L434266 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
L434265 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ It smelled.
L434264 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ You did?
L434263 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
L434262 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I like your hair.  And that suit.
L434261 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I don't have a problem with it.
L434260 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ A girl.
L434259 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What, as a sales rep?
L434258 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Is that how you think of yourself?
L434257 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
L434256 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Well, we got that out of the way.  Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living?
L434255 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Love it.
L434254 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ You like bourbon?
L434252 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ No, they're all right.  I meant, you just got here.
L434251 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Those guys bother you?
L434250 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Don't leave me.
L434249 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I can go to the bar.
L434248 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.
L433754 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I just thought maybe you and me could--
L433753 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
L433752 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands, we'll make it an island.
L433751 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
L433750 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
L433749 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Unless you wanna tell me.
L433748 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
L433747 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
L433746 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
L433745 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
L433741 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Because you're having too much fun.
L433740 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Why not?
L433739 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ You won't do that.
L433738 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.
L433737 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
L433736 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
L433735 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ How do we do that?
L433734 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Think I could have them back?
L433733 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ And your gun.
L433732 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
L433731 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Really.  He has a cop's face.
L433730 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ That's my dad.
L433729 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
L433728 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ None of your business.
L433727 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Who was it answered the phone?
L433726 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ How'd you get this number?
L433722 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Yes.
L433721 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ You know who this is?
L433476 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Shit...
L433475 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
L433470 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Uh-huh.  Well, but if --
L433469 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I mean, romantically.
L433468 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Really.
L433467 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
L433466 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Yeah...
L433465 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ With Robert Redford, when he was young.
L433464 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked, <i>Three Days of the Condor</i>.
L433463 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You have to be kidding.
L433462 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
L433461 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You'd probably tell me.
L433460 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I mean if you didn't know who I was.
L433459 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Nothing.
L433458 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen.
L433457 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ It wasn't pretty after, no, but if you were in that car -- eating a sandwich -- you wouldn't have known what hit you.
L433456 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Bleeding on a country road.
L433455 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
L433454 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Peter Finch.
L433453 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
L433452 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ <i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
L433451 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
L433450 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Faye Dunaway.
L433449 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ That part in the movie where they get shot?  Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name.
L433448 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.
L433447 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
L433446 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
L433445 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Is that right?
L433444 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
L433443 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
L433442 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You must see yourself as some kind of Clyde Barrow.
L433441 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
L433440 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do.
L433439 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Sure.
L433438 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ We still talk, though.
L433437 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L433436 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.
L433435 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
L433434 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
L433433 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
L433432 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ You don't act like it.
L433431 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Of course I am.
L433430 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ You don't seem all that scared.
L433429 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I don't have to.  I don't rob banks.
L433428 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
L433427 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison.
L433426 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I believe you would have.  Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went.
L433425 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
L433424 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I thought so, too.
L433423 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ That's funny.
L433422 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
L433421 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ How many was that?
L433420 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.
L433419 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Why, are you famous?
L433418 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
L433417 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
L433416 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ One I gave him, yeah.  Fuck...
L433415 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Buddy.  That's his given name?
L433414 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Who, Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy. Back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail.  She's a born-again Christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob.
L433413 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this.
L433412 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
L433411 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
L433410 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
L433409 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
L433408 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
L433407 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
L433406 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Boy, it stunk in there.
L433403 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ In my bag, in the car.
L433402 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Where's your gun, your pistol?
L433401 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ You devil, it's mace, huh?  What've you got here, a billy?  Use it on poor unfortunate offenders.
L433400 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
L433399 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
L433398 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ If I could have a little more room.
L433397 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ You comfy?
L433395 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys.
L433394 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Why you're just a girl.  What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?
L434061 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Why?  Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?
L434060 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ I thought you guys were busted.
L434043 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.
L434042 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Whose blood you got all over you?
L434041 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ I don't know...
L434040 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ What happened to your shades?  Someone finally step on 'em?
L434039 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Yeah?  She said that to you?
L434038 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ She <i>knew</i> me from some bullshit dope bust.  She drove me to court.  Twice. You know what she said, we're in the car on the turnpike?  "I never forget anybody I've cuffed and shackled."
L434037 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake?
L434036 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Weren't you expecting us?
L433506 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ The backseat.
L433505 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ In the trunk?
L433504 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
L433503 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ You're in civilization now, man, ease up.
L433502 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Wait in the car.
L433501 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ You don't take 'em off, I'm gonna throw 'em off the overpass while they're still on your head.
L433500 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ I see better with them on.
L433499 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Take your sunglasses off.
L433492 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Oh, nuthin'.
L433491 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ Studs.  Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc.  What's going on?
L433490 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Oh, hey, Studs?  We thought you were somebody else.
L433370 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Use your head.  The guys got five million lying around his house, you really think he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it?
L433369 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ You think he's lying?
L433368 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
L433367 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ So.  What's your point?
L433366 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
L433365 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
L433359 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ I'll take the shades off.  Just get this fuckin' thing off me.
L433358 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
L433357 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
L433356 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
