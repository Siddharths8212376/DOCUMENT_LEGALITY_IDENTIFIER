L239789 +++$+++ u1136 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ BRIDE +++$+++ I didn't break your precious clock, Roy!
L239788 +++$+++ u1141 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ GROOM +++$+++ Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
L239787 +++$+++ u1136 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ BRIDE +++$+++ Roy?  Your clock broke.
L239785 +++$+++ u1136 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ BRIDE +++$+++ Well, thanks a lot.
L239784 +++$+++ u1141 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ GROOM +++$+++ I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
L239783 +++$+++ u1136 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ BRIDE +++$+++ Aren't you glad we waited?
L239577 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ I was just going to say "eight."  You're fantastic!
L239576 +++$+++ u1137 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ COED +++$+++ Eight o'clock?
L239575 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
L239569 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Definitely.  I think you may be a very gifted telepath.
L239568 +++$+++ u1137 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ COED +++$+++ Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
L239567 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.
L239554 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Well, you're doing great.  Keep it up.
L239553 +++$+++ u1137 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ COED +++$+++ No.  They're just coming to me.
L239552 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?
L239551 +++$+++ u1137 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ COED +++$+++ Ummm -- figure eight?
L239550 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Ready?  What is it?
L239546 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ It is a star!  That's great.  You're very good.
L239545 +++$+++ u1137 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ COED +++$+++ Is it a star?
L240310 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ All right, what happened to me?
L240309 +++$+++ u1144 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
L240308 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.
L240220 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ I am Zuul.
L240219 +++$+++ u1144 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Are you the Gatekeeper?
L240015 +++$+++ u1144 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I got the Twister game for later ...
L240014 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
L240013 +++$+++ u1144 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.
L240012 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
L240011 +++$+++ u1144 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
L240010 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Hi, Louis.
L240009 +++$+++ u1144 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Oh, Dana, it's you.
L239676 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.
L239675 +++$+++ u1144 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
L239674 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
L239673 +++$+++ u1144 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
L239672 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
L239671 +++$+++ u1144 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
L239670 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Are you sick, Louis?
L239669 +++$+++ u1144 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ ... I thought it was the drug store.
L239668 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Hi, Louis.
L239667 +++$+++ u1144 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Oh, Dana, it's you ...
L240316 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Talk to my accountant. 
L240315 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high.
L240314 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Thank you.  Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call.
L240313 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
L240312 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Really!  Is it gone?
L240311 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
L240064 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Whoa!! Nice voice.
L240063 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
L240062 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
L240061 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ I am Zuul.  I am ...
L240060 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
L240059 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ I want you inside me.
L240058 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
L240056 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Take me now.
L240055 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
L240054 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Do you want this body?
L240053 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
L240052 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ He is the Destructor.
L240051 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
L240050 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
L240048 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
L240047 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
L239944 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ I've got to go now.
L239943 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
L239942 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ All right.  Since you put it that way.
L239941 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
L239940 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
L239939 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
L239938 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ What's he doing in my refrigerator.
L239937 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ "Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
L239936 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
L239935 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
L239934 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ You must have gotten the last copy.
L239933 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
L239932 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Can't you tell me now?
L239931 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
L239930 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
L239929 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Is he dying or something?
L239928 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
L239927 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Who's the stiff?
L239926 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
L239925 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
L239924 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
L239923 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ You're the best one in your row.
L239922 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ You heard it?
L239921 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Great rehearsal.
L239776 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ No kiss?
L239775 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Goodbye.
L239774 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Okay.  Then I'll go.
L239773 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ All right.
L239772 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
L239771 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Then leave.
L239770 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Don't scream.
L239769 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ I'll scream.
L239768 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ I want to help you.
L239767 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Out!
L239766 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ On a purely scientific basis.
L239765 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ That's it.  Get out.
L239764 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ I think I should spend the night here.
L239763 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ All right.  What do you want to do?
L239762 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
L239761 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
L239760 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
L239759 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
L239758 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
L239757 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Yeah, yeah.
L239756 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Are you all right?
L239755 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Damn!
L239753 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ I know.  It happened by itself.
L239752 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ I told you, I ...
L239751 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ You're quite a housekeeper.
L239750 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ I'll wait here if you don't mind.
L239749 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Well, let's check it out.
L239748 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L239747 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Nothing.  Is that the kitchen?
L239746 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ What?
L239745 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ That's too bad.
L239743 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Thanks.  What's in there?
L239742 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Like a used car salesman.
L239741 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ No?  What do I act like?
L239740 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ You really don't act like a scientist.
L239739 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Yeah, but it's got a great cello break.
L239738 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ That's a violin concerto.
L239737 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
L239736 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
L239735 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
L239734 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ No.  If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real.  I'm not ready to do that.
L239733 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
L239732 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Spengler,  see if you can find the word "Zuul" in any of the literature.  I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment.
L239731 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means.
L239728 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ It's in the stars.
L239727 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Is that your professional opinion?
L239720 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
L239719 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
L239715 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ So what do you think it was?
L239714 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ ... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.
L239711 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Barrett.  Dana Barrett.
L239710 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ We're all professionals here, Miss ...
L239709 +++$+++ u1138 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
L239708 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
L239640 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ I see.
L239639 +++$+++ u1139 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DEAN YAEGER +++$+++ Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.
L239638 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ But why?  The students love us!
L239637 +++$+++ u1139 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DEAN YAEGER +++$+++ Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
L239636 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
L239635 +++$+++ u1139 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ DEAN YAEGER +++$+++ No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
L239634 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
L240323 +++$+++ u1140 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ FIRST BUM +++$+++ That would definitely explain it.
L240322 +++$+++ u1147 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ SECOND BUM +++$+++ I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
L240321 +++$+++ u1140 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ FIRST BUM +++$+++ You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
L240320 +++$+++ u1147 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ SECOND BUM +++$+++ Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
L240319 +++$+++ u1140 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ FIRST BUM +++$+++ Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
L240032 +++$+++ u1147 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ SECOND BUM +++$+++ Definitely some sort of fighting Spaniel, I think.
L240031 +++$+++ u1140 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ FIRST BUM +++$+++ He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
L240030 +++$+++ u1147 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ SECOND BUM +++$+++ That is one speedy mutt.
L239621 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ We'll get back to you.
L239620 +++$+++ u1142 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ HEAD LIBRARIAN +++$+++ Did you see it?  What was it?
L239602 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
L239601 +++$+++ u1142 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ HEAD LIBRARIAN +++$+++ What's that got to do with it?
L239593 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ One thing at a time.  We don't even know what it is yet.
L239592 +++$+++ u1142 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ HEAD LIBRARIAN +++$+++ Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
L239591 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
L239590 +++$+++ u1142 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ HEAD LIBRARIAN +++$+++ Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?
L240232 +++$+++ u1149 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ Thank you.
L240231 +++$+++ u1143 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ JANINE +++$+++ Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
L240230 +++$+++ u1149 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ I don't believe in luck.
L240229 +++$+++ u1143 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ JANINE +++$+++ It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
L240228 +++$+++ u1149 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ What is it?
L240227 +++$+++ u1143 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ JANINE +++$+++ I want you to have this. 
L240118 +++$+++ u1143 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ JANINE +++$+++ That's so romantic.
L240117 +++$+++ u1149 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
L240116 +++$+++ u1143 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ JANINE +++$+++ In the physical sense.
L240115 +++$+++ u1149 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ Die in what sense?
L240114 +++$+++ u1143 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ JANINE +++$+++ Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die.

L239964 +++$+++ u1143 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ JANINE +++$+++ I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.

L239802 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
L239801 +++$+++ u1150 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Has this ever happened before?
L239800 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
