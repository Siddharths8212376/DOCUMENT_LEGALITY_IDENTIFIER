L93362 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
L93361 +++$+++ u556 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ To bed?
L93360 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ To bed.
L93359 +++$+++ u556 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Where are you going?
L93358 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?
L93357 +++$+++ u556 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Those sluts!
L93356 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
L93355 +++$+++ u556 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
L93354 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ What's it to you?!
L93353 +++$+++ u556 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Who did he leave with?
L93352 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ We did not leave together.
L93351 +++$+++ u556 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ What's that mean?
L93350 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ Uh..he might of.
L93349 +++$+++ u556 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ He go back to the hotel?
L93305 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
L93304 +++$+++ u556 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Go to the bathroom.
L93255 +++$+++ u556 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
L93254 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ Um... Eve?
L93250 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
L93249 +++$+++ u556 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
L93248 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ Eve?!
L93247 +++$+++ u556 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
L93215 +++$+++ u556 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
L93214 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ Always good advice.
L93213 +++$+++ u556 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Just be yourself.
L93181 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ He's from Alaska.
L93180 +++$+++ u556 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ That water's freezing!
L93177 +++$+++ u556 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ No.
L93176 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
L93174 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ Let me show you the entire trousseau!
L93173 +++$+++ u556 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I think...it...works.
L93172 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ Well, what do you think?
L93159 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ What do you think, Adam?
L93158 +++$+++ u556 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
L93157 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ Alright, I will.
L93149 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ That's what I'm sensing.
L93148 +++$+++ u556 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
L93147 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ I see "elegant."
L93146 +++$+++ u556 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
L93145 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
L93144 +++$+++ u556 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Well, that's blunt!
L93143 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
L93142 +++$+++ u556 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ What's that supposed to mean?
L93141 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ You're serious, aren't you?
L93138 +++$+++ u556 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
L93137 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ I don't know.
L93134 +++$+++ u556 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
L93133 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ But first, you have to start with the clothes!
L93079 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ Oh, my God...
L93078 +++$+++ u556 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Give me your hand.
L93075 +++$+++ u556 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?
L93074 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ Oh, yes.
L93073 +++$+++ u556 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
L93068 +++$+++ u556 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
L93067 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
L93055 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ Darlin', this is X-File stuff!  Think about it!  The guy's got all this easily negotiable property. He's obviously setting something up very big.  Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America, for instance. Or perhaps he's the head of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard worse.
L93054 +++$+++ u556 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I knew you'd like him.
L93053 +++$+++ u567 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TROY +++$+++ Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
L92570 +++$+++ u561 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ I'll give it to ya, no money down. The neighborhood has gone to hell anyway.
L92569 +++$+++ u564 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ SODA JERK +++$+++ Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
L92568 +++$+++ u561 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Buy it from me?
L92567 +++$+++ u564 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ SODA JERK +++$+++ Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
L92566 +++$+++ u561 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole!
L92540 +++$+++ u564 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ SODA JERK +++$+++ Um...uh...
L92539 +++$+++ u561 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
L92537 +++$+++ u564 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ SODA JERK +++$+++ Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
L92536 +++$+++ u561 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
L92534 +++$+++ u564 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ SODA JERK +++$+++ You bet, Mom! Coming up!
L92533 +++$+++ u561 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
L92423 +++$+++ u566 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TOWER +++$+++ Roger, Wolf One.
L92422 +++$+++ u562 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
L92421 +++$+++ u566 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TOWER +++$+++ The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
L92420 +++$+++ u562 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Tower, say again!!
L92395 +++$+++ u566 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TOWER +++$+++ Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to the ocean?
L92394 +++$+++ u562 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
L92393 +++$+++ u566 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TOWER +++$+++ Wolf One -- say intentions.
L92363 +++$+++ u562 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Stand by. One.
L92362 +++$+++ u566 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ TOWER +++$+++ Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
L92361 +++$+++ u562 +++$+++ m35 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
L97520 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
L97519 +++$+++ u568 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ AUNT BARBARA +++$+++ Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
L97518 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
L97208 +++$+++ u568 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ AUNT BARBARA +++$+++ Okay honey.
L97207 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
L97206 +++$+++ u568 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ AUNT BARBARA +++$+++ I've seen a few.
L97205 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
L97204 +++$+++ u568 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ AUNT BARBARA +++$+++ Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
L97203 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
L96982 +++$+++ u568 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ AUNT BARBARA +++$+++ I'm not sick.
L96981 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?
L96827 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
L96826 +++$+++ u568 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ AUNT BARBARA +++$+++ Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
L96788 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
L96787 +++$+++ u568 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ AUNT BARBARA +++$+++ I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
L96767 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yeah. How's Dad?
L96766 +++$+++ u568 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ AUNT BARBARA +++$+++ You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
L96765 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
L97482 +++$+++ u573 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.

L97450 +++$+++ u569 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Frank. Come in.
L97681 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Oh my God. Is her son OK?
L97680 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ Not yet.
L97679 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
L97678 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
L97672 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
L97671 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
L97670 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
L97669 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
L97548 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yes sir.
L97547 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
L97546 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yes sir. I sure am.
L97545 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ You're all through with this now?
L97544 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Only you and the photo lab.
L97543 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ Who knows you have these?
L97542 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ No, not at all.
L97541 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ Is Sandy part of this?
L97540 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
L97539 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
L97538 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
L97537 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
L97535 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
L97534 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ Okay?
L97533 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yeah.
L97532 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
L97531 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
L97530 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ Jeffrey! Come on in.
L97444 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ It's blue. Blue velvet.
L97443 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ What color is it?
L97268 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
L97267 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ What is this? What color is it?
L97266 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yeah. I get it.
L97265 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
L97264 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Why do you do it?
L97263 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
L97262 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I guess you've seen some bad things.
L97261 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ Yes.
L97260 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Is that why you say it's horrible?
L97259 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ The criminals are winning.
L97258 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Anything you can tell me?
L97257 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ Okay.
L97256 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
L97254 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.
L97253 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yes?
L97252 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ Jeffrey?
L96857 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ And it's horrible too.  I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.
L96856 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ It must be great.
L96855 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
L96854 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
L96853 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't.
L96850 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
L96849 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ Come into the study a minute.
L96820 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
L96819 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
L96818 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
L96812 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
L96811 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
L96810 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ You did? A human ear?
L96809 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
L96808 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
L96807 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
L96806 +++$+++ u570 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DETECTIVE WILLIAMS +++$+++ Yes.
L96805 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Are you Detective Williams?
L97645 +++$+++ u571 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Hold me. I'M FALLING!
L97644 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
L97643 +++$+++ u571 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
L97642 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Don? Where is he?
L97641 +++$+++ u571 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Hold me, Don.
L97635 +++$+++ u571 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Don. Help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
L97634 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Who, Dorothy?
L97633 +++$+++ u571 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ They hurt his head.
L97624 +++$+++ u571 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ My secret lover.
L97623 +++$+++ u574 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ It's okay. It's okay.
L97622 +++$+++ u571 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
L97618 +++$+++ u571 +++$+++ m36 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God.
