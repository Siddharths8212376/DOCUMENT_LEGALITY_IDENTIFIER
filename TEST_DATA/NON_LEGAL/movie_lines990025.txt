L296730 +++$+++ u5999 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Good-night dad.
L296727 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed.
L296726 +++$+++ u5999 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Fascist!
L296725 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.
L296724 +++$+++ u5999 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Dad stop it!
L296907 +++$+++ u5990 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I thought I'd start trying. If you don't mind. But I am going to Florida and I do have a new nurse.
L296906 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
L296905 +++$+++ u5990 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
L296904 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ What?
L296903 +++$+++ u5990 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Ben, I'm going to Florida. I hate Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I have a new nurse. She's a negro, she weighs three hundred pounds, and I've decided to leave my entire estate to her.
L296902 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Oh. Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving. It's just going to be you this year.
L296901 +++$+++ u5990 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It was all junk!
L296900 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
L296899 +++$+++ u5990 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties.
L296782 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ But I -- well maybe I love her. Elena.
L296781 +++$+++ u5990 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ But what?
L296780 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ But...
L296779 +++$+++ u5990 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ -- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance.
L296778 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ -- 73
L296777 +++$+++ u5990 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --
L296776 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ -- What advice? You never --
L296775 +++$+++ u5990 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ -- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --
L296774 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --
L296773 +++$+++ u5990 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ -- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought --
L296772 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but --
L296771 +++$+++ u5990 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now --
L296770 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Actually it's not about work, it's advice about --
L296769 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You know, dah--
L296768 +++$+++ u5990 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?
L296767 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I was actually trying to see about getting a little advice, you know --
L296766 +++$+++ u5990 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ That's besides the point.
L296765 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ -- Well what am I supposed to call you?
L296764 +++$+++ u5990 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
L296763 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
L297174 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Darn it, Dave.
L297173 +++$+++ u5989 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
L297172 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ It's what?
L297171 +++$+++ u5989 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
L297170 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Good shit.
L297168 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Thanks for the advice Dave.
L297167 +++$+++ u5989 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ Welcome to the Monkey House has been a seminal influence on me -- hey Benjamin -- give it a try? This stuff will make some sense out of those larger questions.
L296892 +++$+++ u5985 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ And Reverend Edwards? Did you make the list?
L296891 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ I suppose we'll make an appearance.
L296890 +++$+++ u5985 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena, you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halford's?
L296712 +++$+++ u5985 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ It was lovely!
L296711 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Thank you Janey.
L296708 +++$+++ u5985 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ You know, it's a California thing. That scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in L.A. you know, the men put their car keys in a bowl, and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home with whoever's keys they've got. Anyhow that's how she met this Rod person or whatever his name is and he's left his wife and she's packing for California. Irwin is devastated. It's so ironic.
L296707 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ A key party?
L296706 +++$+++ u5985 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ And to think -- they met at a key party of all things.
L297374 +++$+++ u5992 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Phone's out. I hope the pipe's --
L297373 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Sure. Maybe coffee.
L297372 +++$+++ u5992 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room.
L297331 +++$+++ u5992 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yes. Well, I guess we can walk from here.
L297330 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Yeah. You?
L297329 +++$+++ u5992 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You okay?
L297311 +++$+++ u5992 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Of course.
L297310 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
L297309 +++$+++ u5992 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
L297308 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Well, we can talk about it.
L297307 +++$+++ u5992 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
L297306 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
L297305 +++$+++ u5992 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Things are really rotten at home. You wouldn't believe how rotten. Janey's sick. She's unstable, I guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it -- it's like I can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't --
L297301 +++$+++ u5992 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Nah, that wasn't in the contract.
L297300 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
L297299 +++$+++ u5992 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What the hey. Let's go for a drive.
L297298 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't --
L297297 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all.
L297296 +++$+++ u5992 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
L297295 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --
L297294 +++$+++ u5992 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You want coffee or something?
L297293 +++$+++ u5992 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Somehow it was different in my imagination when I thought about it. Actually, I didn't think about it at all, really.
L297292 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
L297291 +++$+++ u5992 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening.
L297290 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Let me.
L297289 +++$+++ u5992 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well, I have to say I don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around?
L297382 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ It'll warm you up.
L297381 +++$+++ u5999 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ I don't like coffee.
L297122 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.
L297121 +++$+++ u5999 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.
L297120 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ What sort of problems are you planning exactly?
L297119 +++$+++ u5999 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
L297118 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ I suppose. Why?
L297117 +++$+++ u5999 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?
L297116 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ We're going to the Halford's. The number's on the calendar in the kitchen. We should be home around 11.
L296841 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Well, I'm sure your father and I would love to hear what you're playing these days. Maybe after dinner.
L296840 +++$+++ u5999 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.
L296839 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
L296838 +++$+++ u5999 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ They need the money for my band uniform at school.
L296837 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Oh Wendy.
L296836 +++$+++ u5999 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
L296835 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
L296834 +++$+++ u5999 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --
L296833 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.
L296832 +++$+++ u5999 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ You're not a psycho!
L296831 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.
L296830 +++$+++ u5999 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Mom. Are you ok?
L296829 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Weightless almost -- as if I were seeing my own memories of being a girl. There was something internal about it.
L296827 +++$+++ u5999 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ We were just riding around.
L296826 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Mikey Williams?
L296825 +++$+++ u5999 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Nobody.
L296824 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Who?
L296823 +++$+++ u5999 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ With Mikey?
L296822 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ I saw you on your bike today.
L296821 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Hi Wendy.
L296820 +++$+++ u5999 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Hi mom.
L296921 +++$+++ u5991 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ None at all. I'll leave it in front of your garage. Happy Thanksgiving.
L296920 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
L296919 +++$+++ u5991 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ Here you are.
L296918 +++$+++ u5991 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me.
L296917 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
L296916 +++$+++ u5991 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ Educated guess.
L296915 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ How'd you know?
L296914 +++$+++ u5991 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ Social work?
L296913 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ I'm thinking of going back to school.
L296912 +++$+++ u5991 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ It's not like we're too busy.
L296911 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ I used to know how to cook.
L296910 +++$+++ u5991 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
L296909 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Thanks again. For the dinner.
L296705 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Of course.
L296704 +++$+++ u5991 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ It's really quite all right.
L296703 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Oh.
L296702 +++$+++ u5991 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ I insist.  Don't touch them.
L296701 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ It's not a bother.
L296700 +++$+++ u5991 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ Please don't.
L297218 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ I'm going to try hard not to understand the implications of that simile.
L297217 +++$+++ u5997 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PHILIP +++$+++ Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
L297216 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ You're here... I'm a bit surprised.
L297215 +++$+++ u5997 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PHILIP +++$+++ Perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me Philip?
L297214 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Reverend Edwards.
L296897 +++$+++ u5997 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PHILIP +++$+++ That I will indeed.
L296896 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care.
L296895 +++$+++ u5997 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PHILIP +++$+++ I'm afraid she's something of a gossip, isn't she?
L296889 +++$+++ u5997 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PHILIP +++$+++ Ouch.
L296888 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ And you're still trying to get me into bed.
L296887 +++$+++ u5997 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PHILIP +++$+++ Now you are being rude.
L296886 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ But not too ashamed.
L296885 +++$+++ u5997 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PHILIP +++$+++ You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
L296884 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
L296883 +++$+++ u5997 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PHILIP +++$+++ If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
L296882 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
L296881 +++$+++ u5997 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PHILIP +++$+++ Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
L296880 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ That's right.
L296879 +++$+++ u5997 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PHILIP +++$+++ You ask what the point is?
L296878 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
L296877 +++$+++ u5997 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PHILIP +++$+++ -- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.
L296876 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ You're saying that Christ is the child, and --
L296875 +++$+++ u5997 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PHILIP +++$+++ In many ways, the church-bound tradition of the father, son, and holy ghost is simply a version of the parent-child-adult triad within us all. It's a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology.
L296799 +++$+++ u5997 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PHILIP +++$+++ Forget how to ride a bike.
L296798 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Forget what?
L296797 +++$+++ u5997 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PHILIP +++$+++ They say you never forget.
L296796 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ My daughter. I haven't been on a bike for years.  When was the last time you rode a bike?
L296795 +++$+++ u5997 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PHILIP +++$+++ Well I of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion -- at times it's the disorganization that's liberating -- and of course I've begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments, in small groups, and one on one, couples --
L296794 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --
L296793 +++$+++ u5997 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PHILIP +++$+++ It's been a tremendously transformative year -- maybe a little controversial of course, but we're breaking down the old Unitarian barriers --
L296788 +++$+++ u5997 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PHILIP +++$+++ No need to make excuses --
L296787 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Yes, it was -- I ended up --
L296786 +++$+++ u5997 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PHILIP +++$+++ Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.
L296785 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Yes.
L296784 +++$+++ u5997 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PHILIP +++$+++ Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?
L297227 +++$+++ u5996 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ One for you and one for me.
L297226 +++$+++ u5987 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
L297225 +++$+++ u5996 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.
L297224 +++$+++ u5987 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Like into one of the other 20 or so bathrooms they've got in this place.
L297223 +++$+++ u5996 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ And whence has yon virginal maiden absconded?
L297191 +++$+++ u5987 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Moisture! Moisture!
L297190 +++$+++ u5996 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Huh?
L297186 +++$+++ u5987 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ All will be revealed, baby.
