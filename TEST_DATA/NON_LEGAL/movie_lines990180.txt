L430126 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
L430122 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Maybe.
L430121 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Live happily ever after.
L430120 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
L430119 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ A foreign land full of millions of Italian men...  speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
L430117 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ He was on his way to Venice, right? I called the tourist bureau and I must've called every hotel in the city, but I found where he's staying. 
L430116 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
L430115 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Thank you so much.
L430114 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ My God, you have...
L430113 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ No, I haven't.  And you forgot about the fortune teller.
L430110 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person. 
L430109 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
L430102 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Of course not.  I told him I was going to visit a great aunt.  And don't tell Larry, either.
L430101 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Does Dwayne know about this?
L430100 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
L430099 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Because you were afraid to fly.
L430098 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
L430097 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ You don't have a passport.
L430096 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I have vacation time coming to me.
L430095 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ What about your job?
L430094 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ It's still the new year...
L430093 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ But it's July.
L430092 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.
L430072 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ The woman at my dry cleaners believes there's no such thing as coincidence.
L430071 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ It's a coincidence.
L430070 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ It's a miracle.
L430047 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ After all, he is my brother, and I know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes, but I know him pretty well, and I really don't think--
L430046 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ No...  I can just tell.
L430045 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Have you seen him with someone?
L430043 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ I think he's having an affair.
L430042 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Is that bad?...
L430041 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Larry brought me flowers last night.
L430040 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Kate, is something the matter?
L430039 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect?  Well, guess what?... It isn't.  Not for you, not for anybody.
L430038 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I understand, Kate.  What do you think of this garter?
L430037 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ People have problems, insecurities, flaws-- and you have to learn to compromise, to overlook, to forgive.  It's not settling, Faith, it's life.  Real life.
L430036 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I know.  You're right.
L430035 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work.
L430034 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Yeah.  I guess you're right.  I really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den.
L430033 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ But one day you wake up and realize you've been had.  Of course life isn't like the movies.  That's why there are movies.
L430032 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ That's the problem.  When you're a kid you think life is gonna be like the movies.  Dreams come true, the good guys win, people live happily ever after... all that crap.  Turn.
L430031 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
L430030 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ But what?
L430029 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I know...  It was.
L430028 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
L430027 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
L430026 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Come on, it's not so bad.
L430015 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Well, I wouldn't've if I hadn't thought I was in love.
L430014 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Yes you did.
L430013 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.
L429980 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ If you've never been out with him, how do you know you don't want to go out with him?
L429979 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
L429978 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Why don't you ask him?
L429977 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ No.  He's never asked me.
L429976 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ "Thrills"?  That's what you're waiting for?  You know how long that lasts?  Besides, how do you know?  Have you ever been out with him?
L429973 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ He's a podiatrist or something.
L429972 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ You don't have any idea?
L429971 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I don't know, Kate.
L429970 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ What's he do?
L429969 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ So, he's not my type.  Let me walk you to the elevator.
L429968 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ So?...
L429967 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I don't know.  I don't think so.
L429966 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Is he gay?
L429965 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ No.
L429964 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Is he married?
L429963 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ No.
L429956 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry.  And I did say I'd try to pick something up.
L429955 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I wish you didn't have to go so early.
L429954 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
L429953 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
L429952 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ So, what's your point?
L429951 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ But somebody wrote those songs.
L429950 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
L429949 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Is everything okay?
L429942 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.
L429941 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
L429940 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
L429939 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I don't have an Amana freezer.
L429937 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
L429936 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
L429935 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Oh.
L429934 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Scientologist.
L429933 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ How about that guy at the bank?
L429932 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Just moved in with his girlfriend.
L429931 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ How about the other one?  His friend.
L429930 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ No.  He smokes.
L429929 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?
L429928 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
L429927 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I don't believe in statistics.
L429892 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
L429891 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
L430825 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ That's exactly what you are.
L430824 +++$+++ u6942 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ Huh?
L430823 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Giovanni.
L430822 +++$+++ u6942 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting--
L430821 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ But I do want to.
L430820 +++$+++ u6942 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ You don't have to go if you don't want to...
L430819 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But... I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to.
L430818 +++$+++ u6942 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ I thank you.
L430817 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Giovanni, I want to thank you.
L430526 +++$+++ u6942 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ What do the years matter?  I've known you for centuries...
L430525 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ How old are you?
L430524 +++$+++ u6942 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ You see, in America they care for work, they live to work.  But in Italy, they care for food, for love, for pleasure...
L430523 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Oh.
L430522 +++$+++ u6942 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ It's siesta.
L430517 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ I'd love to.
L430516 +++$+++ u6942 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
L430515 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.
L430514 +++$+++ u6942 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ Oh.
L430307 +++$+++ u6942 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ A pig!  A pig!  She's saying he's a pig.
L430306 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ A porco?
L430305 +++$+++ u6942 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
L430304 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?
L430284 +++$+++ u6942 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ This is your most lucky day.  My family runs a pension not three blocks from here.
L430283 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
L430282 +++$+++ u6942 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
L430281 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Kate.
L430280 +++$+++ u6942 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ And you are?...
L430957 +++$+++ u6945 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ She didn't give me a chance.
L430956 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ And you didn't tell her?
L430955 +++$+++ u6945 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
L430954 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ She what?!
L430943 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Faith.  Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
L430942 +++$+++ u6945 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Yeah--
L430937 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ He missed me.
L430936 +++$+++ u6945 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ I came after the woman I love.
L430932 +++$+++ u6945 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ I can't tell her.  She's called off her wedding.  She'll never speak to me again.
L430931 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Larry, you've got to tell her.
L430930 +++$+++ u6945 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
L430929 +++$+++ u6945 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ I thought she'd get a kick out of it.
L430927 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Went to high school with him. But...
L430926 +++$+++ u6945 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ He existed.  He was some kid I knew from Little League.  He was a real jerk.  You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?
L430925 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?
L430924 +++$+++ u6945 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
L430923 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ What?  You know him?
L430922 +++$+++ u6945 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Damon Bradley?  That's why you're here?
L430009 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ You said it differently then.
L430008 +++$+++ u6945 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You used to love it when I called you doll.
L430007 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
L430006 +++$+++ u6945 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ We're all desperate for the money, doll.  That's what made this country great.  Back me up on this Candy, am I right?
L430005 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Sociologist.  And because.  Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners.  They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.
L430004 +++$+++ u6945 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
L430003 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
L429999 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ No.
L429998 +++$+++ u6945 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ And we didn't have to bring another present?
L429997 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Right.
L429996 +++$+++ u6945 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ This is the last one before the wedding, right?
L429948 +++$+++ u6945 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Well, there's nothing here to eat.
L429947 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ No, why?
L429946 +++$+++ u6945 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
L429945 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ You miss me?...
L429944 +++$+++ u6945 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
L430687 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Sorry...
L430686 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Thanks.
L430685 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Oh, it's you.  It's only Peter.
L430629 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
L430628 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
L430512 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Ten billion to one.
L430511 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?
L430508 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ That's really romantic.
L430507 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
L430506 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Whatever.  And I thought, please God, give me a sign, give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever.  And He did. She told me the name.  Granted, it wasn't my name, but it was a start.
L430505 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Mania.
L430504 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
L430503 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Do you know I wasn't even supposed to be in Rome?  My boss was supposed to come to this conference, and at the last minute he got the measles.  The measles. Who gets the measles at forty-three?  So they sent me. And I wasn't supposed to be in that piazza that night either.  I'd gone to the movies, only it was sold out.  So I was wandering around. Just wandering...  When I got hit in the head with this shoe.
L430502 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Good strategy.
L430501 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
L430499 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No!  That's not fair.  That's not it at all.  Look, something somewhere got screwed up.  Maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed.  I may not have the right name, but I was there.  I'm the guy.  I'm-- skywriting??
L430498 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
L430497 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Where is she?
L430496 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ She's not here.
L430495 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I have to talk to her.
L431495 +++$+++ u6949 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ BARNEY +++$+++ You know Johnny when he gets mad.
L431494 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I'll come over when I'm ready.
L431493 +++$+++ u6949 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ BARNEY +++$+++ I'd get over there, Terry. I'll take the little lady home.
L431492 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I'm gonna take her home first.
L431491 +++$+++ u6949 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ BARNEY +++$+++ He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
L431490 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Right now?
L431563 +++$+++ u6964 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ When I was a mere spit of a lad on Ferry Street in Dublin the nuns used to say to me, "Nolan, don't be swallowin' ye words like fishballs. When you got something to say—  —Talk with your mouth wide open," so if I'm loud don't blame me— it's the fault of the nuns!
L431562 +++$+++ u6950 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ BIG MAC +++$+++ And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
L431561 +++$+++ u6964 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
L431560 +++$+++ u6950 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ BIG MAC +++$+++ If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth—
L431559 +++$+++ u6964 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ Talk louder. I can't hear you.
L431558 +++$+++ u6950 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ BIG MAC +++$+++ And don't be walking off with any of that. You know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.
L431880 +++$+++ u6952 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ COUNSEL +++$+++ That's all. Next witness!
L431879 +++$+++ u6950 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ BIG MAC +++$+++ What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
L431878 +++$+++ u6952 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ COUNSEL +++$+++ Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?
L431877 +++$+++ u6950 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ BIG MAC +++$+++ We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
L431876 +++$+++ u6952 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ COUNSEL +++$+++ Well, where are they?
L431875 +++$+++ u6950 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ BIG MAC +++$+++ Sure we keep records!
L431874 +++$+++ u6952 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ COUNSEL +++$+++ You mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand, five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records?
L431704 +++$+++ u6961 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ This is for you to figure out. You can have it your way or you can have it his way.  But you can't have it both ways.  Am I right, Sonny?
L431703 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ But my own kid bro—
L431702 +++$+++ u6961 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Then don't.
L431701 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ Johnny, I can't do that. I can't do that, Johnny.
L431700 +++$+++ u6961 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
L431699 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
L431698 +++$+++ u6961 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Very simple. Just bring him to... that place we been using. Mac, you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need him.
L431697 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ What do you want me to do, Johnny?
L431696 +++$+++ u6961 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ So do I, Charley. For your sake.
