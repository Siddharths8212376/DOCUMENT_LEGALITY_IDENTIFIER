L287725 +++$+++ u5872 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ BENZA +++$+++ Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.
L287722 +++$+++ u5872 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ BENZA +++$+++ Bullshit--a man will do anything to save his family.  Who's running the show up there?
L287721 +++$+++ u5895 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TUZEE +++$+++ He knows better than that.
L287720 +++$+++ u5872 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ BENZA +++$+++ Put our people on the scene.  Smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.
L287719 +++$+++ u5872 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ BENZA +++$+++ <u>Fuck</u> them!  Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this.
L287718 +++$+++ u5895 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TUZEE +++$+++ You should warn them, Sonny.
L287708 +++$+++ u5895 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TUZEE +++$+++ I took the call from Glen personally. They're still in Smith's house.
L287707 +++$+++ u5872 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ BENZA +++$+++ Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
L287706 +++$+++ u5895 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TUZEE +++$+++ Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.
L287717 +++$+++ u5872 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ BENZA +++$+++ No way.  I tell them, that Old Man is gonna handle this from back there.
L287716 +++$+++ u5876 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ FISCHER +++$+++ If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
L287715 +++$+++ u5872 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ BENZA +++$+++ What, he's cute?  That's his idea of humor?
L287712 +++$+++ u5872 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ BENZA +++$+++ I guess not, too.  How much information is in the house?
L287711 +++$+++ u5876 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ FISCHER +++$+++ I guess not.
L287710 +++$+++ u5872 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ BENZA +++$+++ You think we should take that chance?
L287709 +++$+++ u5876 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ FISCHER +++$+++ Maybe we're getting too dramatic.  It's three kids.  They'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that.  Why would they search the house?
L287605 +++$+++ u5896 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
L287604 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ <u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
L287603 +++$+++ u5896 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
L287602 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Bullshit!
L287601 +++$+++ u5896 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ You won't die if you let me help.
L287600 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
L287595 +++$+++ u5896 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers and judges who can help you.
L287594 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ <u>Get on the floor</u>!
L287591 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ You're not goin' anywhere!  Get on the fuckin' floor!
L287590 +++$+++ u5896 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I'm going to my desk.
L287589 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Stay down!  Stay <u>down</u>, goddamnit!
L287514 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Am I talkin' raghead?!  I want your car! <u>Gimme the goddamned keys</u>!
L287513 +++$+++ u5896 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ The car.  All you want is the car?
L287512 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine.  I'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car.
L287511 +++$+++ u5896 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Who sent you?
L287509 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
L287508 +++$+++ u5896 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Jen?  Are you all right?
L288179 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I'm not going to die for this!
L288178 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Then we might as well die rich.
L288177 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ That money's fucked up your brain. Talley's going to get tired of waiting for us to give up, and we'll all be fuckin' killed!
L288176 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
L288175 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ It's over.  We have to give up.
L288174 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid...
L288173 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
L288172 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
L288171 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L288170 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash.  That's how we'll stay alive.
L288092 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Celebrate what?  Going to prison?
L288091 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ For chrissake, <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!
L288090 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ There is no way out.
L288089 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
L288088 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ We're fucked.
L287856 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
L287855 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.
L287853 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Like what?
L287852 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Not if they're looking at something else.
L287851 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.
L287850 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.
L287849 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --
L287848 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?
L287786 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Jesus, first Mars, now you.  You two need anti-depressants.
L287785 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide.
L287666 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
L287665 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Jesus.  What is this?
L287663 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ You're being stupid.  Check out the bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a window --
L287662 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
L287661 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
L287660 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting!
L287659 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ It's about Mars --
L287658 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
L287657 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I have to tell you something --
L287583 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ We should give up.  All we're doing is making it worse.
L287582 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
L287581 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
L287485 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ We're surrounded by houses, dumbass. Every house has a car in the garage. All we have to do is take one.
L287484 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ We're on foot.  We can't get away.
L287483 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.
L287481 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ What if he's dead?  What if you killed him?
L287480 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
L287479 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ That woman's gonna call the cops.
L287474 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ I didn't know he would have a gun!  It just went off!
L287473 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ There's fuckin' blood all over you!
L287466 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Because if you don't take the chance, you're already dead.
L287465 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
L287464 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
L287463 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
L287462 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
L287460 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
L287459 +++$+++ u5881 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
L288123 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Give up, Dennis.  Let these people go. At least you'll have your life.
L288122 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ It ain't been a good day, Chief.
L288120 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ There's a million dollars in there, maybe <u>two</u> million.  I'll give you half.
L288119 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Give up.
L288118 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
L288117 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.
L288114 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?
L288113 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
L288112 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
L288111 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?
L288110 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Only if you try to grab me.  We could've shot you from the wall.
L288109 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?
L288019 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ You've already helped yourself once, Dennis; be smart again.  If you save his life, it'll help when you get to court.
L288018 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
L288017 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
L288016 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
L288015 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Let me come get him.
L288014 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Okay.
L288013 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Now I understand.  That helps.  I can make them understand that.
L288003 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead.  They think you murdered him.
L288002 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ We been through that.  Forget it.
L288001 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.
L288000 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
L287999 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
L287998 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ That you, Talley?
L287888 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.
L287887 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ You're a funny guy, Talley.
L287886 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I gotta piss real bad.
L287885 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ What?
L287884 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Hey, Dennis?  Can I let you in on a personal secret?
L287883 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?
L287882 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ I'll give you these people.
L287881 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
L287880 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
L287879 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I'm here.
L287878 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Talley?
L287874 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ We'll burn this fuckin' place down!  I got gasoline all over in here!
L287873 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ It's over now, Dennis!  Don't hurt anyone.
L287654 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ I got these people!  You try to come get me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them!
L287653 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
L287652 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
L287651 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Dennis?  I want you to release those people.
L287650 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ How about the cop?
L287649 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.
L287648 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ You don't have to explain shit!  That Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for it.  That Chinaman shot himself.
L287647 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ All three subjects are confirmed inside. Call off the house-to-house.  Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your situation --
L287646 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ They're fine.
L287645 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
L287644 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
L287643 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
L287642 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ We're cool.
L287641 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
L287640 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
L287639 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car?
L287638 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ You with the cops?
L287906 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm like before.  That little fuck untied himself anyway.
L287905 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ <u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
L287904 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
L287903 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ What about my father?
L287791 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I'm getting a doctor!
L287790 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Use more ice.
L287789 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
L287788 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
L287787 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ My father needs a doctor.  <u>Please</u>.
L287624 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Shut up and sit down.  You think someone's gonna make a house call?
L287623 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ He needs a doctor.
L287506 +++$+++ u5879 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ My father.
L287505 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Who else is here?
L288252 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Jesus, get upstairs and find out!  If he took those kids, we're fucked!
L288251 +++$+++ u5886 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARS +++$+++ I don't know.
L288250 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ <u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
L288249 +++$+++ u5886 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARS +++$+++ I overheard him with the girl.
L288248 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ You mean he <u>left</u>, as in went out the front door?
L288184 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Fuckin' A.
L288183 +++$+++ u5886 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARS +++$+++ I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going to leave.
L288182 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ You got something to say?
L288095 +++$+++ u5886 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARS +++$+++ Dennis.
L288094 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share.  And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars.
L287902 +++$+++ u5886 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARS +++$+++ They'll cut the power.
L287901 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ What the fuck is that?
L287862 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ We don't have time!
L287861 +++$+++ u5886 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARS +++$+++ I got the gasoline --
L287860 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ The cops are comin'!
L287797 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Find something, Kevin.  Don't just stand there.  And tie this bastard, too.  I don't want him waking up and goin' Rambo on us.
L287796 +++$+++ u5886 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARS +++$+++ Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
L287795 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ That's right.  That's a good idea, Mars.
L287781 +++$+++ u5886 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MARS +++$+++ You can't run with suitcases.
L287780 +++$+++ u5874 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ We can take it with us.
