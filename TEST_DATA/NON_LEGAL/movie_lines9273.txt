L395694 +++$+++ u2174 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW'S VOICE +++$+++ I haven't.
L395693 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
L395692 +++$+++ u2174 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW'S VOICE +++$+++ No.
L395691 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ No. Are you?
L396263 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Yes!!!
L396262 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ You are , aren't you?
L396261 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ What's that got to do with it?
L396260 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
L396259 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ What's that got to do with it?
L396258 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.
L396250 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
L396249 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Oh, thank you!
L396149 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all.
L396148 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ It isn't all! I'd like to explain—
L396147 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ That's all, Miss Bennett.
L396146 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Yes, but I—
L396145 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ And you saw them happen?
L396144 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
L396143 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ But they did take place?
L396142 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ NO!!
L396141 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Are they true!
L396140 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Yes!
L396139 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Were you present when all these things took place?
L396138 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Yes!
L396137 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Are these the articles?
L396136 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Yes!
L396135 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
L396134 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Yes.
L396133 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Were you given an assignment to follow the activities of Longfellow Deeds?
L396130 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ No! I resigned last week!
L396129 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?
L396128 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ No!
L396127 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?
L396125 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Your Honor!
L396124 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
L395948 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Oh, hello darling.
L395947 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Hello, Mary?
L395870 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Yes, of course.
L395869 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Would you like to read it? It's to you.
L395865 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Mary - I - excuse me—
L395864 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
L395863 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Well, here we are again.
L395861 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike a lot through the woods and I'd always take this girl with me so I could talk to her. I'd show her my pet trees and things. Sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it.
L395860 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ A girl?
L395859 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
L395858 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ No, I don't mind.
L395857 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
L395855 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ I don't blame you.
L395854 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ In a day or so, I think.
L395853 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Are you? When?
L395852 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Mary, I'm going home.
L395851 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ All right.
L395850 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Let's just walk, okay?
L395849 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.
L395843 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Thank you.
L395842 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
L395841 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Ready?
L395836 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ I'll get my hat.
L395835 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Yes, if it isn't too late.
L395829 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ You threw them out!
L395828 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out!
L395827 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ I didn't think you could come with the party and everything.
L395745 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ I'd like to read it some time.
L395744 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
L395743 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
L395742 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ I wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
L395741 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
L395740 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?
L395721 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ It had better be good.
L395720 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
L395719 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ "Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
L395718 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
L395717 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Oh, I suppose you could do better.
L395716 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Sure!
L395715 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
L395714 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ He did?
L395713 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ The drums. He taught me to play some.
L395712 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ What did he play?
L395711 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Yeah, I know.
L395710 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ He did? I play the tuba—
L395709 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ He played in the town band, too.
L395708 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ He sounds like a person worth while knowing.
L395707 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
L395706 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ You have?
L395705 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ I've often thought about going back.
L395703 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Gosh! What do you know about that!
L395702 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
L395701 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Really?
L395700 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ I'm from a small town too, you know.
L395699 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
L395698 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ I haven't met anybody here that I like, particularly. They all seem to have the St. Vitus Dance.[12]  Except you, of course.  People here are funny. They work so hard at living - they forget how to live  Last night, after I left you, I was walking along and looking at the tall buildings and I got to thinking about what Thoreau said. They created a lot of grand palaces here - but they forgot to create the noblemen to put in them.
L395697 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
L395696 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Oh, I don't know.
L395689 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Nothing—
L395688 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ What did you mean by that?
L395687 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Oh, that—
L395686 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ You said I was a lady in distress.
L395685 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ What's that?
L395684 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.
L395683 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers around.
L395682 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Here's a nice place.
L395680 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?
L395679 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
L395678 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?
L395677 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
L395675 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Why don't you try?
L395674 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ You can almost spit on it, can't you?
L395673 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ There's Times Square.
L395648 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Me?  Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as President—  Things like that can only happen in a country like America.
L395647 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Now, what do you see?
L395646 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ That depends on what they see.
L395645 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ I say, to most people it's a washout.
L395644 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Huh?
L395643 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ To most people, it's an awful letdown.
L395642 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ It's wonderful.
L395641 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
L395635 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Yeah, let's.
L395634 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Yes.
L395633 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
L395631 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ That's what I like about you. You think about a man's feelings. I'd like to go down to that newspaper and punch the fellow in the nose that's writing that stuff—
L395630 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L395629 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Have you seen the papers?
L395624 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Do you always wear your hair like that?
L395623 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ What are they going to do?
L395622 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
L395621 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ What did they say?
L395620 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
L395619 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ What did they say?
L395618 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
L395615 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Oh, that - well, we had another meeting. I told them I'd go on being Chairman if—
L395614 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Oh. What's happening about the opera?
L395613 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Sure. I met you.
L395606 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.
L395605 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
L395604 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ I enjoy it.
L395603 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ It's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
L395497 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Oh, I don't mind.
L395496 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.
L395448 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Really?
L395447 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.
L395443 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ No. That is, I didn't—  Until I met you. I like talking to you, though—  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
L395442 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
L395432 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Oh - uh - nothing.
L395431 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ What?
L395430 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
L395429 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
L395428 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.  Oh, I'm really just a nobody.
L395427 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Tell me more about yourself.
L395426 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
L395425 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Feel better now?
L395420 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Well, I guess I walked too much. I've been looking for a job all day. I found one, too. I start tomorrow.  You've been awfully kind. Thank you very much.
L395419 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ What happened?
L395418 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
L395417 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Look, this is my house. I'd like to—
L395416 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ No, thank you. I'll be all right.
L395413 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
L395412 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ You fainted.
L395825 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Hello.
L395824 +++$+++ u2175 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MABEL +++$+++ Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .
L395810 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ We're not going out tonight.
L395809 +++$+++ u2175 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MABEL +++$+++ Just a minute. No, you don't.
L395802 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.  At least I can save him that .
L395801 +++$+++ u2175 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MABEL +++$+++ You're acting like a school girl.
L395800 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
L395799 +++$+++ u2175 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MABEL +++$+++ What'll I tell him if he calls up?
L395798 +++$+++ u2175 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MABEL +++$+++ Running away is no solution.
L395797 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
L395796 +++$+++ u2175 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MABEL +++$+++ You're a fool, Babe.
L395762 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
L395761 +++$+++ u2175 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MABEL +++$+++ Huh?
L395760 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
L395759 +++$+++ u2175 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MABEL +++$+++ Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
L395758 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
L395757 +++$+++ u2175 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MABEL +++$+++ The guy's balmy.
L395756 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
