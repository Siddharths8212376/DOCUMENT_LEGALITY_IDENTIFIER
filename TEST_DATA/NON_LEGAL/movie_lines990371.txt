L560759 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ You got wax in your ears?
L560758 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Tea?
L560757 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Nothing, nothing. I just want to invite him to tea.
L560756 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ What are you going to do to him?
L560755 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
L560754 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh. Why? does he live up here?
L560753 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I didn't bring any  --
L560752 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy?  Let's get high.
L560751 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it?
L560750 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!
L560749 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I don't understand.
L560748 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Baby -- I'm going to take you higher.
L560747 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ A night on the town instead of under it?
L560746 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ She knows. Clever, very clever.  And unappreciated. But I'm going to take you away from all this.
L560745 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I know...
L560744 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've --  -- neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know.
L560742 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I knew you'd hit me.
L560741 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.
L560740 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ You're not going to hit me?
L560739 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Something you can feed the pets, perhaps?  Let's have it.
L560738 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ There was a recipe on the back  --
L560737 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ No news is not good news. Y'know
L560733 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ You have two minutes and thirty- two seconds.
L560732 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ You?! How about me?
L560731 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Don't let me down.
L560728 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Nothing.
L560727 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in  --
L560726 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ They stop for nothing.
L560724 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Ready.
L560723 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Ready?
L560722 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Is that an innuendo, Miss Teschmacher? Because if it is, you are about to experience the heady thrill of being hurled from a moving vehicle.
L560721 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
L560720 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
L560719 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
L560718 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?
L560665 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ The least we can do is leave him another door jam.
L560664 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ What do you suggest, my dear?
L560663 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ We just take it?
L560662 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ The door jam, Miss Teschmacher. This Ethiopian shmendrick here, in his simple, unconscious way, needed something to wedge the door open, the better to inhale the flies that form such an  important part of his diet. So he grabs something from the table...
L560661 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ You're not going to tell us why you're happy, are you?
L560660 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ La de da da...
L560659 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ You're happy, aren't you?
L560648 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.
L560647 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Breathe that air, Miss Teschmacher.
L560639 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ No, you're going to get kissed,
L560638 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
L560637 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
L560636 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
L560635 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Ahh. 'National Geographic." In my day, this made 'Playboy" look like Mother Goose.
L560633 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Bingo!
L560632 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Meteorites!
L560625 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?
L560624 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Mr. Romance...
L560623 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Stay and listen!  Besides, it's twelve in the afternoon. This is no time to go to bed.
L560622 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I'm going to bed.
L560621 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
L560620 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ See?
L560618 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Exactly, Miss Teschmacher.
L560617 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I read the article.
L560616 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Some people can read 'War and Peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. Other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe.  Y'know.
L560615 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
L560614 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Krypton!
L560553 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ When it gets to seventy-five below, stabilize it.
L560552 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Fifty degrees below and still falling.
L560551 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ What's the temperature now?
L560550 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,
L560549 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Damn!  This will get him.
L560548 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I didn't say a word.
L560547 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Shut up.
L560546 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ You're on.
L560545 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Bet he makes it.
L560544 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Tough guy, huh?
L560543 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Nuts. He made it.
L560503 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ He's from another world.
L560502 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ You think he's for real?
L560501 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ I needed this, Y'know? I really needed this. just when I'm nearing the fruition of my project, Big Bird flies into town.  Go ahead! Kill me by inches! Put me on the agony rack!
L560394 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ First the pets, Otis.
L560393 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Again???
L560390 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it?
L560389 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?
L560365 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Even that would be an improvement.
L560364 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
L560363 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
L560362 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
L560361 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ So I've noticed.
L560360 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
L560359 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ This??
L560358 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.
L560357 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Your father was a sick weirdo.
L560356 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
L560355 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Why does it all mean so much to you? All the time, 'land, land, land.'
L560354 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address.
L560353 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
L560352 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
L560351 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ You and your real estate.
L560127 +++$+++ u8031 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JOR-EL +++$+++ Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
L560126 +++$+++ u8028 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ FIRST ELDER +++$+++ Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
L560123 +++$+++ u8028 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ FIRST ELDER +++$+++ If you persist, you leave us no choice.
L560122 +++$+++ u8031 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JOR-EL +++$+++ As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?
L560117 +++$+++ u8031 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JOR-EL +++$+++ And if I don't obey?
L560116 +++$+++ u8028 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ FIRST ELDER +++$+++ This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!
L560115 +++$+++ u8031 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JOR-EL +++$+++ I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton.
L560108 +++$+++ u8028 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ FIRST ELDER +++$+++ But so is Vond-El
L560107 +++$+++ u8031 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JOR-EL +++$+++ Then -
L560106 +++$+++ u8028 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ FIRST ELDER +++$+++ You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
L560105 +++$+++ u8031 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JOR-EL +++$+++ My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
L560104 +++$+++ u8028 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ FIRST ELDER +++$+++ Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
L560103 +++$+++ u8031 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JOR-EL +++$+++ But you can't ignore these facts!  It's suicide!  Worse than that, it's genocide.
L560271 +++$+++ u8029 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
L560270 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
L560268 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter, Jimmy.  Besides, the chief of detectives has the hots for me.
L560267 +++$+++ u8029 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
L560266 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Gets you where you live, huh?
L560265 +++$+++ u8029 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Boy!
L560263 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ 'And the people on the street, the little man who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.' 
L560262 +++$+++ u8029 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Two.
L560261 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting?
L560260 +++$+++ u8029 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ What're you writing, Lois?
L560215 +++$+++ u8035 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I bless the day you came to us, son. You know that. But some people wouldn't understand.
L560214 +++$+++ u8030 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
L560213 +++$+++ u8035 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Oh, dear. That isn't what I --
L560191 +++$+++ u8035 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Don't brag now,  Jonathan.
L560190 +++$+++ u8030 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
L560181 +++$+++ u8035 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ We don't want a child called 'Junior,' ain't that so, Clark? Why sure it is.
L560180 +++$+++ u8030 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
L560179 +++$+++ u8035 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
L560178 +++$+++ u8030 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
L560177 +++$+++ u8035 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned.  Poor thing.
L560176 +++$+++ u8030 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ Folks'll ask question.
L560175 +++$+++ u8035 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
L560174 +++$+++ u8030 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ He sure as heck does that.
L560173 +++$+++ u8035 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ The good lord works in mysterious ways.
L560172 +++$+++ u8035 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ All of us.
L560171 +++$+++ u8030 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ Well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.
L560169 +++$+++ u8035 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Don't just stand there gapin' Jonathan. Can't you see he's cold?
L560168 +++$+++ u8030 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ What's your name, boy?
L560167 +++$+++ u8035 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ It's a ...baby.
L560152 +++$+++ u8031 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JOR-EL +++$+++ Then you have on of those 'feelings.' It was called: 'love.'
L560151 +++$+++ u8032 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ I want to know what my child is going to face.
L560150 +++$+++ u8031 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JOR-EL +++$+++ You've been doing some research in the archives.
L560139 +++$+++ u8031 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JOR-EL +++$+++ Well, physiologically, he...	won't quite fit.
L560138 +++$+++ u8032 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ He will be odd, different.
L560137 +++$+++ u8031 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JOR-EL +++$+++ Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
L560136 +++$+++ u8032 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ He'll be weightless.
L560135 +++$+++ u8031 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JOR-EL +++$+++ Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
L560134 +++$+++ u8032 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
L560133 +++$+++ u8031 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JOR-EL +++$+++ They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
L560132 +++$+++ u8032 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
L560131 +++$+++ u8031 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JOR-EL +++$+++ Lara, please...
L560130 +++$+++ u8032 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ -- as we will be.
L560129 +++$+++ u8031 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JOR-EL +++$+++ It's the only logical conclusion. If he remains here, he'll be as dead as...
L560495 +++$+++ u8031 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JOR-EL +++$+++ And it is forbidden for you to interfere with human history. All you can do, Kal-El, even now that you have...found yourself...is help them to evolve. Set an example. Show them they must strive towards the light. And... remember us...
L560494 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ There are none of them any good anyway.
L560493 +++$+++ u8031 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JOR-EL +++$+++ Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
L560492 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Twenty-four.
L560491 +++$+++ u8031 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JOR-EL +++$+++ ....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -
L560490 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ How good it felt -
L560489 +++$+++ u8031 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JOR-EL +++$+++ How good it felt!
L560488 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ No! You couldn't imagine -
L560487 +++$+++ u8031 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JOR-EL +++$+++ My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
L560486 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ I guess I got carried away
L560485 +++$+++ u8031 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JOR-EL +++$+++ Enjoyed it?
L560484 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ I don't know what to say.  Look, I -- I just -
L560559 +++$+++ u8037 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Whoever comes up with that will make Woodward and Bernstein look like Abbot and Costello.

L560272 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.
L560613 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...

L560606 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ What color underwear am I wearing?

L560604 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Do bullets really bounce off you?
L560603 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
L560602 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Is it true you're impervious to pain?

L560591 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.

L560589 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
