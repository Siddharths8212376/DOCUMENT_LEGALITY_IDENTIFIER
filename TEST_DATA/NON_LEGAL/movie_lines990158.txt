L408347 +++$+++ u6806 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MALLORY +++$+++ Hasn't it?
L408326 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Don't stop!
L408325 +++$+++ u6806 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MALLORY +++$+++ Mickey!
L408319 +++$+++ u6806 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MALLORY +++$+++ Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.
L408318 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ By all means, knock yourself out.
L408317 +++$+++ u6806 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MALLORY +++$+++ Yeah.
L408316 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You got something you want to do?
L408315 +++$+++ u6806 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MALLORY +++$+++ Are we in a big hurry?
L408314 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it?
L407916 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother Tim, if you feel up to it.
L407915 +++$+++ u6806 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MALLORY +++$+++ Naw, she don't mind.
L407985 +++$+++ u6807 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MCCLUSKY +++$+++ Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.
L407984 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
L407983 +++$+++ u6807 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MCCLUSKY +++$+++ Using the same doctors is not common practice.
L407982 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them?
L407981 +++$+++ u6807 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MCCLUSKY +++$+++ The prison board and the doctors who examined them.
L407980 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Who is we?
L407979 +++$+++ u6807 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MCCLUSKY +++$+++ What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
L407978 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
L407977 +++$+++ u6807 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MCCLUSKY +++$+++ Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
L407976 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
L407975 +++$+++ u6807 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MCCLUSKY +++$+++ The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need.
L407974 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum? And who made the decision?
L407640 +++$+++ u6814 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCAGNETTI +++$+++ Ain't love grand.
L407639 +++$+++ u6807 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MCCLUSKY +++$+++ Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage.
L407636 +++$+++ u6807 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MCCLUSKY +++$+++ Mickey's better half herself. Mallory Knox. This little lady drowned her father in a fish tank.
L407635 +++$+++ u6814 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCAGNETTI +++$+++ Who's the song bird?
L407632 +++$+++ u6807 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MCCLUSKY +++$+++ You write the script Jack, call it, 'Showdown in Mojave: The extermination of Mickey and Mallory', whatever... Have we found our man?
L407631 +++$+++ u6814 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCAGNETTI +++$+++ I see.
L407630 +++$+++ u6807 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MCCLUSKY +++$+++ You're a breathing icon of justice and that's why you were chosen to deliver Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We, the prison board we, knows that once you get them on the road if anything should happen, an escape attempt, an accident, fire, anything...Jack 'Supercop' Scagnetti would be there to look out for his public's best interests.
L407628 +++$+++ u6807 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MCCLUSKY +++$+++ You're a celebrated cop. Twenty-six years on the force, a best-seller out on paperback...
L407627 +++$+++ u6814 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCAGNETTI +++$+++ By all means.
L407626 +++$+++ u6807 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MCCLUSKY +++$+++ The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
L407625 +++$+++ u6814 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCAGNETTI +++$+++ So, how do I fit into this scheme?
L407624 +++$+++ u6807 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MCCLUSKY +++$+++ You've heard of it?
L407623 +++$+++ u6814 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCAGNETTI +++$+++ Lobotomy Bay?
L407622 +++$+++ u6807 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MCCLUSKY +++$+++ So can we. So the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally insane.
L407621 +++$+++ u6814 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCAGNETTI +++$+++ I can appreciate that.
L407620 +++$+++ u6807 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MCCLUSKY +++$+++ Look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison will take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as hard as a bar of iron. No one wants those fuckin' assholes behind their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out.
L407619 +++$+++ u6807 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MCCLUSKY +++$+++ Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
L407618 +++$+++ u6814 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCAGNETTI +++$+++ They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
L407617 +++$+++ u6807 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MCCLUSKY +++$+++ Susanville, Soledade.
L407616 +++$+++ u6814 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCAGNETTI +++$+++ They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
L407615 +++$+++ u6807 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MCCLUSKY +++$+++ You been followin' the news coverage?
L407614 +++$+++ u6814 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCAGNETTI +++$+++ Who isn't?
L407611 +++$+++ u6807 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MCCLUSKY +++$+++ Dewight McClusky of the California Prison Board. Take a seat please.
L407610 +++$+++ u6814 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCAGNETTI +++$+++ Thank you, sir.
L407609 +++$+++ u6807 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MCCLUSKY +++$+++ Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti. You put an end to a nightmare. The ladies of this city can get to sleep again, and they have you to thank.
L408282 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Okay, Wayne, step forward.
L408281 +++$+++ u6814 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCAGNETTI +++$+++ Yeah.
L408276 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You're taking us to that holding cell now.  All right, Cut!
L408275 +++$+++ u6814 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCAGNETTI +++$+++ She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
L408274 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' Mallory? I know she's still here, and I know you know where. So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene.
L408232 +++$+++ u6814 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCAGNETTI +++$+++ What?
L408231 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
L408223 +++$+++ u6814 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCAGNETTI +++$+++ I've never wounded anything in my life. I got you locked right between the eyes.
L408222 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
L408221 +++$+++ u6814 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCAGNETTI +++$+++ Slide the shotgun over here, put your hands behind your head, put your forehead on the floor.
L408220 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Looks like we got a Mexican standoff.
L408171 +++$+++ u6814 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCAGNETTI +++$+++ How's it goin'?
L408170 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...one night I was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit, somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a gun, so I go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned out to be nothing. God made the noise. Who knows?
L408289 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Wagons, hooaaa!
L408288 +++$+++ u6813 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Ready.
L408287 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You ready, Donut?
L408244 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Even better. Wayne call your station, tell 'em we're going live a little early today. Make it happen!
L408243 +++$+++ u6813 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ It's video.
L408242 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Do you have a back up.
L408241 +++$+++ u6813 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Not good.
L408240 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ How is it?
L408234 +++$+++ u6813 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L408233 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You guys stay on your bellies.
L408117 +++$+++ u6813 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Look, I'll trade you.
L408116 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Tough titty, it's mine now.
L408115 +++$+++ u6813 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
L408114 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
L408113 +++$+++ u6813 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled I asked for in your box.
L408110 +++$+++ u6813 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Anything.
L408109 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What?
L408108 +++$+++ u6813 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Say something.
L408098 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Oh my God!  Sorry.
L408097 +++$+++ u6813 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ She was born without a tongue.
L408096 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ How come you never talk?
L408411 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ NO!!!
L408410 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Let's make a little music, Colorada.
L408409 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ We are.  Your camera.
L408408 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and Mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale.
L408407 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate you. If anybody in the fuckin' world deserves to die, it's you.
L408406 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---
L408405 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ No. Not really.
L408404 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ ...developed between the three of us. We're kindda in this together, don't ya think?
L408400 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview.  We did an interview, didn't we?
L408399 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Just wait one fucking minute.
L408391 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ So, what now?
L408390 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.
L408379 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...
L408378 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ We ain't got all fuckin' day!
L408364 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Got it.
L408363 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Say it. Scream it. All the way out the front door and into your van. And if you stop screaming, I swear to God I'll blow your head off.
L408362 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Yes.
L408361 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?
L408360 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ 'Respected journalist'-- On your knees...
L408359 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...
L408358 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ 'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?
L408357 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ On average forty million.
L408356 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ That's what I thought. You tell them that. When we go down those stairs, I want you to scream what you just told me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star of American Maniacs watched every week by'-- how many people?
L408312 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ We'll all be killed.
L408311 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
L408310 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
L408309 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ No.
L408308 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
L408307 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Let me have the keys.
L408306 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Out front.
L408305 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Where's it parked?
L408304 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Yeah, we have a van.
L408303 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building.  Donut said something about a news van.
L408239 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Scott's dead. And unless you wanna play follow the leader, shut up and do as you're told.
L408238 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
L408237 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.
L408213 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Now, I'm no comedian, but it's pretty funny. It's a Little Johnny joke. Now in the joke, Little Johnny can't talk. And Little Johnny's teenage sister asks her mother if she can go out on a date.
L408212 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Sure.
L408211 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?
L408183 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Could I get a Coke for Mickey?
L408182 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I could go for a Coke.
L408178 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Okay, let's cut it.
L408177 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The cops, my mom, everybody. But you see, they all missed the point of the story. I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding the shotgun, it all became clear. I realized for the first time my one true calling in life. I'm a natural born killer.
L408168 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ When have they ever been right?
L408167 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Says the United States of America.
L408166 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Says who?
L408165 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
L408164 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ That's indescribable.
L408163 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here?
L408162 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
L408161 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Describe Mallory.
L408160 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I'm sure we will.
L408159 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
L408158 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
L408157 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Tell me about the purity.
L408156 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
L408155 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
L408148 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head? Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that?
L408147 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
L408146 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
L408145 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
L408144 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
L408143 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue?
L408142 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life?
L408141 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Was what worth it?
L408140 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Then was it worth it?
L408139 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
L408138 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Do you miss Mallory?
L408137 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What I did for fun for starters.  Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun...  No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else.
L408136 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.
L408135 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Much obliged. What do I do for fun? Do you want to know what I do for fun or what I did for fun?
L408132 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Aside from the obvious?
L408131 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun.
L408123 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Let's do it.
L408122 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?
L408121 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Don't worry about it.
L408120 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Sorry about that.
L408078 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Let's discuss it when I'm unbound.
L408077 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ All right, Mickey.
L408076 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about.
L407890 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I'm keen with anticipation.
L407889 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Mickey, how do you feel about cross- examining Grace Mulberry?
L407691 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Songs. 'He's A Rebel', 'Leader Of The Pack', 'Town Without Pity', that Dusty Springfield song 'I Only Want To Be With You'. That's what I hear anyway. Her behaviour was the main thing the doctors' report used against you. So even if she would see me, which she won't, I couldn't put her on camera anyway. If I ask her, 'Mallory, are you insane?' And she starts singing 'Dead Skunk In The Middle Of The Road', that blows our whole case.
L407690 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ She sings? What does she sing?
L407689 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Not to anybody. She sings.
L407688 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ She doesn't talk?
L407687 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word.
L407686 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Have you talked to Mallory about this?
L407685 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?
L407684 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ We've been waiting to do a follow up episode on you for a long time. And that time has definitely come.  I feel it's apparent to anyone who's hip to what's going on that the prison board has thrown the constitution straight out the fuckin' window. You and Mallory may be killers, but you're not insane. You belong in a prison, not in an asylum. The prison board is blatantly railroading you into a hospital for the sole purpose of turning you into vegetables. Now some people are saying, 'So what?' I am not one of those people. If we avert our eyes while they do this to you, we give them permission to do it again whenever they see fit. Today they wipe clean your mind because they feel your actions are dangerous, tomorrow they wipe clean my mind because they feel what I say is dangerous. Where does it all stop?
L407683 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
L407682 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Manson beat you.
L407681 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ How 'bout Manson?
L407680 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ What I'd like to do---
L407679 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Good...yuppie piece of shit.
L407678 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
L407677 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
L407676 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Yours.
L407675 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Whose ratings were higher?
L407674 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Yes.
L407673 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
L407672 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ The episode we did on Mickey and Mallory was one of our most popular ones.
L407669 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Everybody knows who you are. You're famous.
L407668 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Hello Mickey. We've never been introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me. I was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial---
L407862 +++$+++ u6809 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MOVIE MALLORY +++$+++ You made every day like kindergarten.
L407861 +++$+++ u6810 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MOVIE MICKEY +++$+++ Yeah baby.
L407854 +++$+++ u6810 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MOVIE MICKEY +++$+++ I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin' down this alley any second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And that's that!
L407853 +++$+++ u6809 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MOVIE MALLORY +++$+++ Mickey, you're wasting time!
L407852 +++$+++ u6810 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MOVIE MICKEY +++$+++ No fuckin' way!
L407851 +++$+++ u6809 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MOVIE MALLORY +++$+++ If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---
L407850 +++$+++ u6810 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MOVIE MICKEY +++$+++ No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!
L407849 +++$+++ u6809 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MOVIE MALLORY +++$+++ I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
L407848 +++$+++ u6810 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MOVIE MICKEY +++$+++ I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
L407847 +++$+++ u6809 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MOVIE MALLORY +++$+++ I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
L407809 +++$+++ u6811 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Unfortunately, yes.
L407808 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ And they made the first move?
L407807 +++$+++ u6811 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
L407806 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
