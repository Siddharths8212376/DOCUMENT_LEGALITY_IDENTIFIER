L454135 +++$+++ u7173 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Huh?
L454134 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What thing?
L454130 +++$+++ u7173 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care, it's none of my business... But I want to see Mary. I want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix and...
L454129 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
L454128 +++$+++ u7173 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ What do you know about it?
L454127 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I was getting to that!
L454126 +++$+++ u7173 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
L454125 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
L454124 +++$+++ u7173 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ A good reason, I suppose.
L454123 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
L454122 +++$+++ u7173 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
L454121 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
L454120 +++$+++ u7173 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
L454119 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What should I know?
L454117 +++$+++ u7173 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Don't you know?
L454116 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What's the matter?
L454115 +++$+++ u7173 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
L454114 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Where?
L454113 +++$+++ u7173 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ With you.
L454112 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Here?
L454111 +++$+++ u7173 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ I want to know if my sister is here.
L454110 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Is something wrong?
L454109 +++$+++ u7173 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Is Mary here?
L454108 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Lila.
L454107 +++$+++ u7173 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ I'm Mary's sister.
L454106 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Sure...
L454105 +++$+++ u7173 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ May I talk to you?
L454104 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yes?
L453891 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
L453890 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hey, we can leave together can't we?
L453889 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Don't miss your plane.
L453888 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ How can you even think a thing like that!
L453887 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm thinking of it.
L453886 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.  Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.
L453885 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'll lick the stamps.
L453884 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps.
L453883 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Sam, let's go get married.
L453882 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
L453881 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I haven't even been married once yet!
L453880 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...
L453879 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
L453878 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
L453877 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm all for it! It requires patience and temperance and a lot of sweating- out... otherwise, though, it's only hard work.  But if I can see you, touch you even as simply as this... I won't mind.
L453876 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You make respectability sound... disrespectful.
L453875 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions.  Even respectability.
L453874 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ All right.
L453873 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Sam! No!
L453872 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
L453871 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
L453870 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
L453869 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No.
L453868 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I can come down next week.
L453867 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I have to go, Sam.
L453866 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
L453865 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
L453864 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ And besides, when you say I make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal.
L453863 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but...
L453862 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Can you?
L453861 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You can't laugh at it, huh?
L453860 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
L453859 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
L453858 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
L453857 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?
L453856 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
L453855 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ For what?
L453854 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Sam. This is the last time.
L453853 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ The only girlish thing you have lost.
L453852 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I've lost my girlish laughter.
L453851 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
L453850 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Sam!
L453849 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
L453848 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
L453847 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
L453846 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
L453845 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ We could laze around here a while longer.
L453844 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
L453843 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.
L454097 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Good night.
L454096 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ That's it. 
L454095 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Crane.
L454094 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Alright, Miss... 
L454093 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Very early. Dawn.
L454092 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you...
L454091 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'd like to, but...
L454090 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.
L454089 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
L454088 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Phoenix?
L454087 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.
L454086 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You're not going to... to your room already?
L454085 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Norman.
L454084 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Thank you, Norman.
L454083 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yes, and just one time can be enough.  Thank you.
L454082 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing.  She needs me... and it isn't...  ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?
L454081 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Well? You meant well?  People always mean well, they cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest so very delicately that...
L454080 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
L454079 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
L454078 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
L454077 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ An Institution? A madhouse?  People always call a madhouse "someplace."  Put her in Someplace!
L454076 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Wouldn't it be better if you put her in... someplace...
L454075 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don't hate her.  I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness.
L454074 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No, not like me.
L454073 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ To a private island, like you?
L454072 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Why don't you go away?
L454071 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ A son is a poor substitute for a lover. 
L454070 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Except you.
L454069 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I mean... ill.  She had to raise me all by herself after my dad died... I was only five... and it must have been a strain. Oh, she didn't have to go out to work or anything, Dad left us with a little something... anyway, a few years ago... Mother met a man. He talked her into building this motel... We could have talked her into anything... and when.  Well... It was just too much for her when he died, too... And the way he died... Oh, it's nothing to talk about when you're eating.  Anyway, it was too much of a loss for my mother... she had nothing left.
L454068 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ She sounded strong...
L454067 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
L454066 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
L454065 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
L454064 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You should... mind it.
L454063 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
L454062 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
L454061 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
L454060 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Why do you ask that?
L454059 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What are you running away from?
L454058 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm looking for a private island.
L454057 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Where are you going? I don't mean to pry...
L454056 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Only my share.
L454055 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
L454054 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You go out... with friends?
L454053 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
L454052 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Is your time so empty?
L454051 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
L454050 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ A man should have a hobby.
L454049 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything. 
L454048 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I imagine so.
L454047 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Uncommon, too.
L454046 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
L454045 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Not really. I hear that expression, that one eats "like a bird," is really a falsie, I mean a falsity, because birds eat a tremendous lot.  Oh, I don't know anything about birds. My hobby is stuffing things... taxidermy. And I guess I'd just rather stuff birds because...  well, I hate the look of beasts when they're stuffed, foxes and chimps and all... some people even stuff dogs and cats... but I can't... I think only birds look well stuffed because they're rather...  passive, to begin with... most of them...
L454044 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You'd know, of course.
L454043 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You eat like a bird.
L454042 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
L454041 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You're very... kind.
L454037 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Don't worry about it.  But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh?
L454036 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I'm sorry. I wish... people could apologize for other people.
L454035 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite.
L454034 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
L454033 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I've caused you some trouble.
L454024 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ All right, you get your dresses hanging out and... change those wet shoes, and I'll come for you soon as it's ready...  ...with my trusty umbrella. 
L454023 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'd like to.
L454022 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.
L454021 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No.
L454020 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
L454019 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Thank you. Again.
L454018 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.
L454017 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I have?
L454016 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You have something most girls never have.
L454015 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Norman Bates.
L454014 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Bates.
L454013 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
L454012 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ The bathroom.
L454011 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there.... 
L454010 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
L454009 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Am I that close to Fairvale?
L454008 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
L454007 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
L454005 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Los Angeles.
L454004 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.
L454002 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I knew you must have. No one stops here anymore unless they do.
L454001 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I thought I'd gotten off the main...
L454000 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.  They moved away the highway.
L453999 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You have a vacancy?
L453998 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Dirty night.
L453948 +++$+++ u7179 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ PATROLMAN +++$+++ Please.
L453947 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Why?
L453946 +++$+++ u7179 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ PATROLMAN +++$+++ May I see your license?
L453945 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Now what?
L453944 +++$+++ u7179 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ PATROLMAN +++$+++ Wait a minute!
L453943 +++$+++ u7179 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ PATROLMAN +++$+++ No need to apologize...
L453942 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L453941 +++$+++ u7179 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ PATROLMAN +++$+++ In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest...
L453940 +++$+++ u7179 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ PATROLMAN +++$+++ Now wait just a moment! Turn your motor off, please.
L453939 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
L453938 +++$+++ u7179 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ PATROLMAN +++$+++ Is there?
L453937 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Please... I'd like to go...
L453936 +++$+++ u7179 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ PATROLMAN +++$+++ Frankly, yes.
L453935 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
L453934 +++$+++ u7179 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ PATROLMAN +++$+++ Is anything wrong?
L453933 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Then I'm free to go...?
L453932 +++$+++ u7179 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ PATROLMAN +++$+++ No, m'am.
L453931 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?
L453930 +++$+++ u7179 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ PATROLMAN +++$+++ There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe...
L453929 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
L453928 +++$+++ u7179 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ PATROLMAN +++$+++ You slept here all night?
L453927 +++$+++ u7175 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
L453926 +++$+++ u7179 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ PATROLMAN +++$+++ In quite a hurry.
L454402 +++$+++ u7176 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MRS. CHAMBERS +++$+++ He's already been.
L454401 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd go out to the motel with you.
L454389 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'd know the difference between Mary and an old woman.
L454388 +++$+++ u7176 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MRS. CHAMBERS +++$+++ Maybe you saw Mary!
L454387 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?
L454336 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No. An old woman, his mother.  That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and...
L454335 +++$+++ u7176 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MRS. CHAMBERS +++$+++ Norman took a wife?
L454334 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
L454333 +++$+++ u7176 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MRS. CHAMBERS +++$+++ Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
L454332 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
L454331 +++$+++ u7176 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MRS. CHAMBERS +++$+++ Mary is Lila's sister?
L454326 +++$+++ u7176 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ MRS. CHAMBERS +++$+++ Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.
L454325 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ We have a problem.
