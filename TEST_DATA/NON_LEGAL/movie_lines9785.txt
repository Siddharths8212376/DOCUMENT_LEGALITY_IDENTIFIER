L184890 +++$+++ u5064 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ GIN +++$+++ No you can't.
L184889 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
L184888 +++$+++ u5064 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ GIN +++$+++ Uh. I'm showing off.
L184887 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Why are we speaking Chinese?
L184886 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ That is of no interest.
L184885 +++$+++ u5064 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ GIN +++$+++ Who am I?
L184884 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ I have a question...
L185454 +++$+++ u5064 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ GIN +++$+++ Tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow. Or forget the Mask.
L185453 +++$+++ u5066 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ QUI +++$+++ Gin, really.
L185452 +++$+++ u5064 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ GIN +++$+++ You should know, when I come back here with the Mask--if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you've done goes to the PRC.
L185451 +++$+++ u5066 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ QUI +++$+++ Always in a rush.
L185450 +++$+++ u5064 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ GIN +++$+++ We need to make the trade tomorrow.
L185449 +++$+++ u5066 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ QUI +++$+++ A true master. Classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think?
L185761 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ Yeah. Probably not.
L185760 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Probably not.
L185759 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ See you.
L185756 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ I been meaning to tell you, far as I'm concerned you're over the hill.
L185755 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Yes it does.
L185754 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ Takes a lot out of you, one like this.
L185490 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...
L185489 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ My friend, you always surprise me.
L185485 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
L185484 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
L185483 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
L185482 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
L185481 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ I figured that out.
L185480 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Take this mask. It may look like the Empress, but it's not.
L185479 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ You don't really think I'd leave ten million dollars worth of our chips in her bag?  What matters isn't what's real. It's what we <u>think</u> is real--what matters is the art.
L185478 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ Thought you had to use some of these.
L185477 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Call it an expression of trust.
L185476 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ You're giving them to me?
L185475 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Thirty-five next generation microchips. Copper, not silicon. Value: one million each.
L185473 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ She won't tell me everything. It's a bank job, that's all I know.
L185472 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
L185471 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ You'll just have to have faith.
L185470 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ To yourself, that's where.
L185469 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ You know where my loyalties lie.
L185468 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
L185467 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
L185466 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ My antenna is up, it is fully extended, and I am picking up...what is it? It is, can it be? The boy is in el, u, v.
L185465 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more.
L185464 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
L185463 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ You're impressed with her, aren't you?
L185462 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ She's calling the shots now.
L185461 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ I'm waiting for the tell part.
L185460 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ This is just show and tell.
L185459 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ That's because we live in the future. Which is what's on my mind.
L185458 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
L185457 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad?
L185456 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Check out my ball.
L185455 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ Tonight your league night?
L185336 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ I'm terribly sorry old man.
L185335 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ You damn well thought wrong.
L185334 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter.
L185332 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ You change partners, you change the rules.
L185331 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Suspicious, after all these years?
L185330 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ You better not be taking on a new partner.
L185329 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ We're supposed to.
L185328 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ You two make quite a couple.
L185327 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Because it pays off.
L185326 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ Remind me why.
L185325 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.
L185324 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ But the second mouse gets the cheese.
L185323 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ The early bird gets the damn worm.
L185322 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ It's too soon.
L185321 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
L185320 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ You look like George Washington.
L185319 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
L185318 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ I said a masked ball, not a costume party.
L185231 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ It better be worth it for me.
L185230 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Oh, it is.
L185229 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ This better be worth 1t.
L185228 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ I'd say she's a size 6 who wears a size 4.
L185227 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Black of course.
L185226 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
L185225 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
L185224 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ Because I never assume anything.
L185223 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Right.
L185220 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.
L185219 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
L185218 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ It's never big enough.
L185217 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ This is big enough.
L185216 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ We might not want to cash in our chips just yet. She has another job after this one. A big one.
L185213 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ You are a miracle worker.
L185212 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
L185211 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
L185210 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ Sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable.
L185209 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ We're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. The air filters might be wired. And a bypass hose for the AC.
L185208 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
L185207 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ The key to success is using the right tools.
L185206 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
L185205 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?
L185204 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ And you do it so well.
L185203 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
L185202 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
L185201 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ Don't go getting sentimental. You're no damn good at it.
L185200 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Tina was a wonderful woman.
L185199 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ In the van.
L185198 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Which is--
L185197 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ They work off the O2 tank just like the slice pack.
L185193 +++$+++ u5065 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Next time I'll use valet parking.
L185192 +++$+++ u5067 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ THIBADEAUX +++$+++ I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports.
L190161 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
L190160 +++$+++ u5068 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad.
L189773 +++$+++ u5068 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Don't use language with me --
L189772 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
L189771 +++$+++ u5068 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Where've you been?
L189615 +++$+++ u5068 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Erin, you've been here three weeks.  If you don't know how to do your job by now, I am not about to do it for you.
L189614 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Anna?  With this real-estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me, cause I'm a little confused about how exactly we do that.
L189565 +++$+++ u5068 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ That's a joke, right?
L189564 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
L189563 +++$+++ u5068 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ ... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files.  That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em all here, alphabetically --
L189921 +++$+++ u5069 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ BAUM +++$+++ Hey, excellent.  Thanks.
L189920 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Tell you what, why don't you go on over to reception, tell them I said Mario should take you to the airport.
L189912 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind.
L189911 +++$+++ u5069 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ BAUM +++$+++ Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation.
L189909 +++$+++ u5069 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ BAUM +++$+++ 250,000 is all I'm authorized to offer.
L189908 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
L189907 +++$+++ u5069 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ BAUM +++$+++ A million things could have caused those problems.  Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final and more than fair.
L189904 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You're kidding, right?  Look at these readings for Christ's sake. PG&E's own technicians documented toxic levels of hexavalent chromium in those test wells, on numerous occasions.
L189903 +++$+++ u5069 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ BAUM +++$+++ I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault.
L189902 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
L189901 +++$+++ u5069 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ BAUM +++$+++ In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
L189900 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ 250,000?
L189875 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ All of them.
L189874 +++$+++ u5070 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ All of 'em?
L189873 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Fax these to this number, okay?
L189547 +++$+++ u5070 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Who?
L189546 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What's she doing here?
L189545 +++$+++ u5070 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.
L189544 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?
L189543 +++$+++ u5070 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ It's those files you asked for.
L189542 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What the hell is this doing here?
L189481 +++$+++ u5070 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.
L189480 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
L189479 +++$+++ u5070 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says.  And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
L189478 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Whoa.  Remind me.
L189477 +++$+++ u5070 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ He's a low-life.  Speaking of which, that's your nine o'clock in there.
L189476 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
L189475 +++$+++ u5070 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.
L189474 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What do you think?  What's this?
L189473 +++$+++ u5070 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ His dry cleaners.  You want him?
L189472 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
L189471 +++$+++ u5070 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Tony Marvin.
L189506 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ That asshole smashed in my fucking neck!
L189505 +++$+++ u5071 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DEFENDING LAWYER +++$+++ An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
L189504 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
L189503 +++$+++ u5071 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DEFENDING LAWYER +++$+++ So you say.
L189502 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ What?  Hey -- <u>he</u> hit <u>me</u>.
L189500 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ What's your point?
L189499 +++$+++ u5071 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DEFENDING LAWYER +++$+++ So.  You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon.
L189496 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
L189495 +++$+++ u5071 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DEFENDING LAWYER +++$+++ There's more than one?
L189494 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Which one?
L189493 +++$+++ u5071 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DEFENDING LAWYER +++$+++ Seventeen thousand in debt.  Whew.  Is your ex-husband helping out?
L190352 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ ... or lemme guess -- toxic waste?
L190351 +++$+++ u5072 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
L190350 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ How does someone get meningitis?
L190349 +++$+++ u5072 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now.
L190348 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Jesus.
L190347 +++$+++ u5072 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
L190346 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis?
L190509 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Oh my God.  Oh my God.
L190508 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Yup.
L190507 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ And get someone to help around the house.
L190506 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Any school you want.
L190505 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ I can put them in a good school.
L190504 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
L190503 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ I don't even know how much money that is.
L190502 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Five million dollars.
L190501 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Five million dollars?
L190500 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
L190499 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Oh, my God.
L190497 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Both.
L190496 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ A number for the whole group, or for us?
L190495 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ The judge came up with a number.
L190494 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
L190493 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ It's a good day.  I feel good.
L190430 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Well, I was gonna head over to the Browns now.  I was thinking -- Mandy really values your opinion ...
L190429 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ For what?
L190428 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna?
L190146 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Sure you are.  You're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire.
L190145 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Sure wish I had longer to get used to the idea.  You think if you got no uterus, and no breasts, you're still technically a woman?
L189883 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG&E?
L189882 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ No.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other.
L189881 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
L189880 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
L189879 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Yeah.
L189878 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
L189877 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
L189876 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
L189712 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Not around here.  This is a rough part of the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.  It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.
L189711 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.
L189709 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ I thought the same thing, right off the bat. That's why we went to see the doctor.  But hunh-uh.  Turns out one's got nothing to do with the other.
L189708 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick --
L189707 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
L189706 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ What's chromium?
L189704 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ The chromium.  Well, that's what kicked this whole thing off.
L189703 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ The what?
L189702 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Cause of the chromium.
