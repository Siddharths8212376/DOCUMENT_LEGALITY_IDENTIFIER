L115516 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ You sure?
L115515 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
L115514 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
L115513 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ No, you're not.
L115512 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.
L115511 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
L115510 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
L115509 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ I'll back that up.
L115508 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Things are kind of confusing.
L115505 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.
L115504 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a hand?
L115503 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.
L115502 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Where are you gonna go?
L115501 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
L115500 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Well, stay here tonight.
L115499 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
L115498 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
L115497 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ God!  Unbelievable.  Vampires.
L115496 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Yeah.
L115495 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ They were vampires, weren't they?
L115494 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Not exactly.
L115493 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?
L115492 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Water.  Okay.
L115491 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ You want some water or something?
L115490 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
L115489 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ How are you doing?
L115473 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --
L115472 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Is that your car?
L115471 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Hi there.
L115470 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Hi.
L115116 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Buffy.
L115115 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name?
L115112 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ You guys are thrashed.
L115111 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
L114965 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ It could happen.
L114964 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Will you guys shut up, please?
L115093 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Like my homework.
L115092 +++$+++ u4302 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Like what?
L115091 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
L115090 +++$+++ u4302 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
L115089 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Bogutude.  Blow it off.
L115088 +++$+++ u4302 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Can't.  History report.  The Normans and the Saxons.
L115070 +++$+++ u4302 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?
L115069 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Bugs.
L115057 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend.
L115056 +++$+++ u4302 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ It is a pretty crucial subject.
L115053 +++$+++ u4302 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ 'One that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them.'
L115052 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ It has to be, like a socially conscious theme.
L115707 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ I know.  I like your little outfit.
L115706 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ You look way pretty, Kim.
L115705 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Yeah, whoops I came.
L115704 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I'm glad you guys are here.  It's good to see you.
L115657 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Get out of my facial.
L115656 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Listen to you.  What language are you speaking?
L115647 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Kimberly, it's a dance.  It's a stupid dance with a bunch of stupid kids that I see every stupid day.
L115646 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
L115645 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Excuse me for having something important to do.
L115630 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Oh my God you're having an affair.
L115629 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
L115628 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
L115627 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I forgot.
L115626 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ You were supposed to be here at three.
L115147 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Get a boob job.
L115146 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
L115145 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
L115095 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Kimberly, it's the senior dance.
L115094 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ I don't see why we have to invite everyone.
L115085 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Cafe Blase.
L115084 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Where?
L115083 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Let's meet tonight, okay?
L114961 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ 'Just remember you're in training, son'
L114960 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ What did Jeffrey's dad say?
L114952 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Nice ensemble!
L114951 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Excuse much!  Not rude or anything.
L114948 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Sounds toasty.  We're going Pavilion.
L114947 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Totally stale.  And the ushers are like, the acne patrol.  We're thinking Pavilion.  Sitch?
L114944 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.
L114943 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Beverly Center.
L114938 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Well, where?
L114937 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Why don't we see a movie?
L114936 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ What are we doing?
L114934 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Please.  It's so '91.
L114933 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ ) What do you think?
L114932 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.
L115570 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ He knows who I am!
L115569 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Wait!
L115535 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ And where are they now?
L115534 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
L115533 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning.
L115532 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Football is my life.
L115531 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
L115530 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
L115529 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
L115528 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ All right.
L115527 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
L115526 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
L115525 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
L115524 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Another distraction.  It's not right.
L115523 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
L115522 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ There isn't time.
L115475 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
L115474 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Interesting.
L115451 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.
L115450 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I want to die.
L115449 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Well, you're on my turf now.  You're just gonna have to trust me.
L115448 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
L115447 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
L115446 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
L115445 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
L115444 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I can't work this.
L115443 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing?
L115423 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Merrick.  You made a joke.  Are you okay, I mean, do you want to lie down?  I know it hurts the first time.
L115422 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Vampires of the world, beware.
L115421 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
L115420 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ As for example, what?
L115419 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy.  I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.
L115418 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ And it makes it worse when I die, right?
L115417 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
L115416 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I'm curious, is all.
L115415 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ It isn't important.
L115414 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I wish you would.
L115413 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge...  ... near a bunch of big rocks. That's where I was born.  My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs.  There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies.  I thought so myself for a time, when I was younger...  I'm sorry.  I'm not supposed to... I shouldn't go on like this.
L115412 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Watchers?
L115411 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
L115410 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ How can you keep doing this?
L115409 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Not if you're careful.
L115408 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
L115407 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Five.
L115406 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Five?
L115405 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ What did you think, that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a Slayer?
L115404 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I...
L115403 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you?
L115402 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Oh, fuck you!
L115401 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
L115400 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
L115399 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Buffy...
L115398 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
L115397 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Don't start with me again.
L115396 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
L115395 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ A what?
L115394 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ You are such a wet.
L115393 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
L115392 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
L115391 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
L115390 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.
L115389 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ You felt a little sick, didn't you? The cramps.
L115388 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
L115387 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
L115386 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Fine.
L115385 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.
L115358 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Try to pay attention.
L115357 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ What!?!
L115347 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Oh.
L115346 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Same one.
L115345 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ They were vampires?
L115344 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ All right.  You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack the Ripper?
L115343 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ My nails.
L115342 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
L115341 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
L115340 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
L115339 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
L115338 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
L115337 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?
L115336 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Your turn.
L115335 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Ooh, another embarrassment for the teabag, while the chosen one is still well under par.
L115334 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Exactly.  You're changing.  You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.
L115333 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
L115332 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
L115331 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Put your head back.
L115330 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
L115329 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Oh.  Sorry.

L115327 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Last night.  You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?
L115326 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ It was necessary.
L115325 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ I don't want to be the chosen one, okay?  I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell.  And then you come along...  and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!
L115324 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
L115323 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ But you threw a knife at my head!
L115322 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I had to test you.
L115321 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head!
L115319 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh.  Good.
L115318 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ No.  You don't do anything.  I do it.
L115317 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
L115316 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ No -- you don't have to --
L115315 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Who we gonna beat?
L115314 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Who we gonna beat?
L115313 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Okay.
L115312 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
L115311 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Here?
L115310 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
L115309 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Sporting events, yeah.
L115308 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
L115307 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
L115306 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ But you enjoyed it, yes?
L115305 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
L115304 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
L115303 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Uh... gym.
L115302 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
L115301 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Not a pressing issue.
L115300 +++$+++ u4310 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.
L115299 +++$+++ u4300 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ BUFFY +++$+++ Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
