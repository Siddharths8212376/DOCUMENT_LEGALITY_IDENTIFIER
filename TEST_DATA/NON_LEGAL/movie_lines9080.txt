L233340 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
L233339 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
L233338 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Never say anything unless you have to.
L233337 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I had to tell 'em something.
L233336 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
L233335 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What?
L233296 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You're kidding, right?
L233295 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
L233292 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ That's right, they're wondering, who's this guy? You don't tell 'em. Understand, Harry? Do not tell 'em who I am.
L233291 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
L233290 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
L233286 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Read it. It's a grabber.
L233285 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?
L233266 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Let's see how we get along.
L233265 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What do you get out of this?
L233264 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
L233263 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You don't even know these guys.
L233262 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
L233261 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Just a thought.
L233260 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
L233259 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -–
L233258 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
L233257 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script.
L233256 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Heart attack. Apparently they brought a couple hookers along.
L233255 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ He drown?
L233254 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
L233253 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ So what's the problem?
L233252 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it.
L233251 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades.
L233250 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ She looks familiar.
L233249 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ "Ride the Clouds". Good picture.
L233248 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
L233247 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ One of his best parts.
L233246 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
L233245 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
L233244 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Who's the star?
L233243 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it.
L233242 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ It's not bad when you know what it's about.
L233241 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ "Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
L233240 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ "Mr. Lovejoy".
L233239 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ What's it called?
L233238 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy".
L233237 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ For a movie?
L233236 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Because I need half a million to buy a script.
L233235 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
L233234 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
L233233 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not?
L233232 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Harry, look at me.
L233231 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal -– this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer –-
L233222 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Racketeering, that covers a lot of ground, doesn't it?
L233221 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
L233220 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Really? You ever been arrested?
L233219 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Once.
L233218 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Ever shot anybody.
L233217 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Maybe a few times I have.
L233216 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What does that mean?
L233215 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Not really.
L233214 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You pack a gun?
L233213 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ They always paid.
L233212 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying.
L233204 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ What I did till recently.  After I get done here I'll think about what I'm gonna do next.
L233203 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Is that right, that's what you do for a living?
L233200 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ So you don't work for the casino?
L233199 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
L233198 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ But you work for the casino?
L233197 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I'm not the guy, Harry.
L233196 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
L233195 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ You mean, Leo?
L233194 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
L233193 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Part of it, yeah.
L233189 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ The shylock? He's barely mentioned. And it's not believable the wife would get a settlement that fast.
L233188 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ The shylock's the good guy.
L233187 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy.
L233186 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I said I had an idea, that's all.
L233185 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ That's it? That's your movie?
L233184 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I don't know about his wanting to meet celebrities, that's something new. But, yeah, he comes to L.A. Then after that, I don't know what happens.
L233183 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ So he comes to L.A...
L233176 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Well, since Leo's name was on the passenger list...
L233175 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Keep going.
L233167 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ That's right. As a matter of fact...
L233166 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
L233158 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. You have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it to make money.
L233157 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ It's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken.
L233154 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I mean, the way you told it to me. Start at the beginning, we see how the story line develops.
L233153 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ You just did.
L233152 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her.
L233144 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
L233143 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
L233139 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen.
L233138 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ You make movies, huh?
L233135 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Fuckin' basketball game.
L233134 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Come on, Harry -– Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.
L233133 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
L233132 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I want you to.
L233131 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Why do I have to keep looking at you?
L233130 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ You're not looking at me, Harry.
L233129 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ They don't want to deposit yours and have it bounce. That annoys them. So your dear friend Dick Allen's been calling, leaving messages on your machine, but you never get back to him. I happen to be in Vegas on another matter, and Dick asks me as a favor would I look you up. I follow you over here, see you in the window with this woman, looks a lot like that actress Karen Flores, was in Grotesque, except she's not blond anymore...
L233128 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I know what a marker is.
L233127 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ A marker's like a check, Harry.
L233125 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Harry, lemme give you some advice.
L233124 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?
L233120 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is.
L233119 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
L233118 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
L233117 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ That's what I'm doing.
L233116 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
L233115 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I'm looking at you.
L233113 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.
L233112 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?
L233110 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
L233109 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Have we met? I don't recall.
L233108 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Where you been, Harry?
L233107 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
L233063 +++$+++ u1082 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ RAY BONES +++$+++ Exactly. You either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket, I don't give a fuck. You don't ever hand me a book with a miss in it.
L233062 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Twenty seven hundred.
L233061 +++$+++ u1082 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ RAY BONES +++$+++ You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh...
L233057 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Ask your man here.
L233056 +++$+++ u1082 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ RAY BONES +++$+++ Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
L233055 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ 'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
L233054 +++$+++ u1082 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ RAY BONES +++$+++ Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.
L233052 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Hey, it's your book now. You want to check it out, go ahead. He's got a dry cleaning business out on Federal Highway.
L233051 +++$+++ u1082 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ RAY BONES +++$+++ Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
L233050 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ It was in the Herald.
L233049 +++$+++ u1082 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ RAY BONES +++$+++ What Get Away jet?
L233048 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
L233047 +++$+++ u1082 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ RAY BONES +++$+++ Personally?
L233046 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Yeah, he told me.
L233045 +++$+++ u1082 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ RAY BONES +++$+++ How'd you know he died, he tell you?
L233044 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ He died.
L233043 +++$+++ u1082 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ RAY BONES +++$+++ You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over.
L233038 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.
L233037 +++$+++ u1082 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ RAY BONES +++$+++ You cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?
L234012 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ That's not bad. I think you got it down.
L234011 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Whatta you think, Chill?
L233682 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Wow.  Mind if I take it for a spin?
L233681 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Compass.
L233680 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ What's that?
L233679 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans.
L233678 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Very nice...
L233673 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Buddy?
L233672 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
L233662 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ You're not going to tell me the rest?
L233661 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ At that point, basically, that has to be it.
L233660 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Okay. I'm listening.
L233659 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
L233658 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?
L233657 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Good-looking, too.  Like Karen.
L233656 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ The wife sues the airline.  This is a gutsy babe.
L233644 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ How do I know that?
L233643 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
L233642 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I turn it on when I confront the guy.
L233641 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I believe it.
L233640 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
L233639 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ That's not bad.
L233638 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ How about this?
L233636 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Now you're squinting like you need glasses.
L233635 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Wait. How about this?
L233634 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?
L233633 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Like this?
L233632 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.
L233631 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I'm looking at you.
L233630 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Martin, look at me.
L233629 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
L233625 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Pressure? I'm the one applied the pressure.
L233624 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ What happened? The pressure got to you?
L233623 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami.
L233621 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ With what? Wiseguy money?
L233620 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ One we're producing.
L233619 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ One of mine?
L233618 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I'm thinking of a movie.
L233617 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
L233616 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ So you want to know.
L233615 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
L233614 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ So you don't know what I'm thinking.
L233611 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads.
L233610 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ You mean like we don't give a shit.
L233609 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
L233608 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ We talk different?
L233607 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
L233606 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.
L233605 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center, the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play.
L233604 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
L233603 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Yeah. That was a good party.
L233428 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I'll find you, Leo...
L233427 +++$+++ u1079 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ But you won't know where I am. I don't even know where I'll be.
L233426 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.
L233425 +++$+++ u1079 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?
L233421 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Sit down, Leo.
L233420 +++$+++ u1079 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ It's all mine.
L233419 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
L233418 +++$+++ u1079 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ How? By taking my money?
L233417 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
L233416 +++$+++ u1079 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?
L233415 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Here's another tip...
L233414 +++$+++ u1079 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ How'd you know I was here?
L233413 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
L233412 +++$+++ u1079 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ Who told you that?
L233411 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
L233410 +++$+++ u1079 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ I'm up twelve grand today.
L233409 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ You've been losing.
