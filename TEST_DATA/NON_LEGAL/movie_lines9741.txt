L157265 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
L157264 +++$+++ u4784 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MR. PERRY +++$+++ When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me.
L157263 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Father, I wasn't disputing you.
L157262 +++$+++ u4784 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MR. PERRY +++$+++ I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
L157261 +++$+++ u4784 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MR. PERRY +++$+++ Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
L157260 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ But father, it's not fair.
L157259 +++$+++ u4784 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MR. PERRY +++$+++ I'm sorry, Neil.
L157258 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ But father, I'm assistant editor.
L157593 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ The god of the cave.
L157592 +++$+++ u4787 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ PITTS +++$+++ What is it?
L157591 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Look at this.
L157435 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Forget it, Pitts, you're coming.  Meeks, your grades hurting too?
L157434 +++$+++ u4787 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ PITTS +++$+++ What is this, a midnight study group?
L157421 +++$+++ u4787 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ PITTS +++$+++ That's miles.
L157420 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Beyond the stream.  I think I know.
L157419 +++$+++ u4787 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ PITTS +++$+++ Where is this cave he's talking about?
L157418 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I say we go tonight.  Everybody in?
L157316 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ But different.
L157315 +++$+++ u4787 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ PITTS +++$+++ Weird.
L157875 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I don't know.
L157874 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Do you have to quit the play?
L157873 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Visit from my father.
L157852 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ That's it!  "Follow my voice.  We'll try no manhood here."  See you at dinner.
L157851 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
L157850 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Put more into it!
L157849 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Yea, art thou there?
L157848 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Chicken shit.  Where were we?
L157847 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ I'll come to the performance.
L157846 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
L157845 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ No thanks.
L157844 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ You should come to rehearsals.  I know they need people to work the lights and stuff.
L157842 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Yes, and acting!  It's got to be one of the most wonderful things in the world. Most people, if they're lucky, live about half an exciting life! If I could get the parts, I could live dozens of lives.
L157841 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ This play?
L157840 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!
L157839 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ I will be with thee straight.
L157838 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Here, villain, draw and ready. where art thou?
L157642 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Yeah!  And just look at this ruler!
L157641 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I mean, this is one special gift!  Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!
L157640 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ what?
L157639 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Look, Todd, you're obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set.
L157638 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother!  His birthday's always a big to-do.  The stupid thing is, I didn't even like the first one.
L157637 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one.  Maybe they thought...
L157636 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Oh. 
L157635 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Oh..
L157634 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
L157633 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ This is your desk set.  I don't get it.
L157632 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ It is?  Happy Birthday.  You get anything?
L157631 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ It's my birthday.
L157630 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Todd, what's the matter?
L157552 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Quiet.  I have to think.
L157551 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Neil, you're not gonna...
L157550 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ From my father and Nolan.
L157549 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ From you?
L157548 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Sssh.  That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission.
L157547 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Neil, how are you gonna do this?
L157512 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ No.
L157511 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ No?  What do you mean 'no'?
L157510 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Er  No.
L157509 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right?
L157508 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
L157507 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
L157506 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ No, I want you in.  But being in means you gotta do something.  Not just say you're in.
L157505 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
L157504 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
L157503 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ What is that supposed to mean?
L157502 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ None of what Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it?
L157501 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ I guess.
L157500 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ By the way, there's a meeting this afternoon.  You coming?
L157499 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Jesus Christ, whose side are you on?  I haven't even gotten the part yet.  Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while?
L157498 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ But if he said no before then...
L157497 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
L157496 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.
L157495 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
L157494 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Come on, that's impossible.
L157493 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.
L157492 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
L157491 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
L157490 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Neil, how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you?
L157489 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Hell no, but that's not the point.  The point is for the first time in my whole goddamned life, I know what I want, and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem, goddamn it!
L157488 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ And now he will?
L157487 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
L157486 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ So?
L157485 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ They're putting it on at Henley Hall. See, open try-outs.
L157484 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ I know that.  What's it got to do with you?
L157483 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ A play, dummy.
L157482 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ A Midsummer Night's Dream. What is it?
L157481 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ What I want to do!  Right now. What is really inside of me.
L157480 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Found what?
L157479 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I've found it.
L157455 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ God, you really have a problem, don't you?  How can it hurt you to read?  I mean isn't that what this is all about? Expressing yourself?
L157454 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.
L157453 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ What?
L157452 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ I don't want to read.
L157451 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
L157450 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Yes.  But
L157449 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ But why?  Don't you understand what Keating is saying?  Don't you want to do something about it?
L157448 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ I... I just don't want to come.
L157447 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ What is it then?
L157329 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Thanks but  I'd better do history.
L157328 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Want to come to the study group?
L157290 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Todd, if you're gonna make it around here, you've gotta speak up.  The meek might inherit the earth but they don't get into Harvard. know what I mean?
L157289 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Nothing.
L157288 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ What?
L157287 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ I'll take him over mine.
L157286 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ So what do you think of my father?
L157232 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ I don't.
L157231 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
L157230 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ My parents wanted me here all along but my grades weren't good enough.  I had to go to Balincrest to pull them up.
L157229 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Oh, so you're that Anderson.
L157228 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ My brother went here.
L157227 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Why'd you leave Balincrest?
L157226 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Todd Anderson.
L157225 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I hear we're going to be roommates. Neil Perry.
L159997 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves.
L159996 +++$+++ u4789 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ They are...they are everywhere.
L159993 +++$+++ u4789 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ We're going to die here! We're going to die!
L159992 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ It's not going to help us!
L159977 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ Why don't you want a message sent?
L159976 +++$+++ u4789 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ He's the owner...
L159975 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ Who are you?
L159960 +++$+++ u4789 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ We have to make it to the third deck...
L159959 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ How do we get out of here?
L159958 +++$+++ u4789 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ Yes.
L159957 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ You the Captain?
L160110 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ I don't know what these things are ...all I know is...
L160109 +++$+++ u4792 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ MAMOOLI +++$+++ And what? These things are octopusses?
L160108 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ Us...I'm talking about us... We're the fish.
L160107 +++$+++ u4792 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ MAMOOLI +++$+++ What the hell are you talking about?
L160106 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish.
L160105 +++$+++ u4792 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ MAMOOLI +++$+++ I'll kill you!! I'll fucking kill you!! I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm not playin' around here!
L160104 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ Nobody's shooting nobody...come on, just let us through the hatch!
L160101 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ Boat or no boat...I'm going...
L160100 +++$+++ u4792 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ MAMOOLI +++$+++ We don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw Billy!
L160097 +++$+++ u4792 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ MAMOOLI +++$+++ Someone...maybe they sent an SOS!
L160096 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ Who?
L160124 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ Or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be.
L160123 +++$+++ u4791 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ HANOVER +++$+++ Maybe we lost them.
L160059 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ Just trying to get to my boat...
L160058 +++$+++ u4791 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ HANOVER +++$+++ You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
L160057 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ That's where my boat's moored.
L160056 +++$+++ u4791 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ HANOVER +++$+++ Who gives a shit about aft?
L159943 +++$+++ u4791 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ HANOVER +++$+++ With who?
L159942 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ Did you clear this?
L159941 +++$+++ u4791 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ HANOVER +++$+++ Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...
L159938 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ I told you...
L159937 +++$+++ u4791 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ HANOVER +++$+++ Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?
L159936 +++$+++ u4791 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ HANOVER +++$+++ Shut up!
L159935 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ Hanover, listen...
L159928 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ Dead.
L159927 +++$+++ u4791 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ HANOVER +++$+++ Where are my men?
L159793 +++$+++ u4791 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ HANOVER +++$+++ I'd say that's a pretty good assumption.
L159792 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ I assume somebody up there has made sure no distress signal can be sent.
L159791 +++$+++ u4791 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ HANOVER +++$+++ And she could do a hell of a barbie to boot! Belt up. You'll find all the parts you need up there.
L159790 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ Great woman your mother. Real foresight.
L159775 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ Then you better start swimming.
L159774 +++$+++ u4791 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ HANOVER +++$+++ Not an option.
L159773 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ You're going to have to get a new one.
L159772 +++$+++ u4791 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ HANOVER +++$+++ We were talking about my schedule...
L159769 +++$+++ u4791 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ HANOVER +++$+++ I have a schedule...
L159768 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
L159767 +++$+++ u4791 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ HANOVER +++$+++ How soon can we get up and running?
L159766 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ Speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
L159723 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ I know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? I need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, I'd highly recommend overlooking the indescretion.
L159722 +++$+++ u4791 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ HANOVER +++$+++ He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
L159721 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ Who asked any?
L159720 +++$+++ u4791 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ HANOVER +++$+++ And no questions asked.
L159719 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ 20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
L159718 +++$+++ u4791 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ HANOVER +++$+++ This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
L159670 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ I don't mind him...but I do think it's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup.
L159669 +++$+++ u4791 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ HANOVER +++$+++ Don't mind him Finnegan...you remember 25...balls of steel... splashing around in a sea of testosterone.
L159665 +++$+++ u4791 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ HANOVER +++$+++ Take note Mr. Mason...this is why you hire a professional...No whining. No excuses.
L159664 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
L159663 +++$+++ u4791 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ HANOVER +++$+++ Which question is that?
L159662 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ Right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.
L159661 +++$+++ u4791 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ HANOVER +++$+++ And where is our point of arrival?
L159660 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ Right here...middle of nowhere...
L159658 +++$+++ u4790 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ FINNEGAN +++$+++ You know what they say...the classics are eternal.
L159657 +++$+++ u4791 +++$+++ m319 +++$+++ HANOVER +++$+++ No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
