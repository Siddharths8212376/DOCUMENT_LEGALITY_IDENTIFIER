L474746 +++$+++ u2628 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ LEDNOV +++$+++ Because there's a man I want to see.
L474745 +++$+++ u2630 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ What for?
L474744 +++$+++ u2628 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ LEDNOV +++$+++ We got to get movin'.
L474730 +++$+++ u2628 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ LEDNOV +++$+++ Lookin' around.
L474729 +++$+++ u2633 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ WYATT +++$+++ What are you doin' --
L474722 +++$+++ u2628 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ LEDNOV +++$+++ Will you quit gabbin' and do what you're told.
L474721 +++$+++ u2633 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ WYATT +++$+++ That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
L474720 +++$+++ u2628 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ LEDNOV +++$+++ Put on another one.
L474719 +++$+++ u2633 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ WYATT +++$+++ He dropped a shoe. You shouldn't be ridin' him.
L474716 +++$+++ u2628 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ LEDNOV +++$+++ Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
L474715 +++$+++ u2633 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ WYATT +++$+++ Why, yes. They're all I need...
L475225 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ If you need me, I'll be --
L475224 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Goodnight, Miss Wells.
L475223 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Goodnight.
L475151 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Steve --
L475150 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ You don't know what it is to be sorry.
L475124 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Thanks, Steve.
L475123 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.
L475115 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ It's a long ways yet.  I figure we ought to camp. She's tired.
L475114 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora.
L474963 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Let me do that.
L474962 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Oh, sure.
L474961 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ She was only teasin'.
L474958 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ He'll treat his wife just as good. Maybe better. Ever see him use a bull snake on the mules like other wranglers?
L474957 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ But you're his brother.
L474956 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Don't pay any attention to him. That's his way and I've found he's sure easy to get along with. I don't recollect him havin' hit me more'n a couple of times and I guess I had it comin'.
L474953 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ I was doin' both. Here.
L474952 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You were supposed to be reading words.
L474951 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you.
L474949 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Sure.
L474948 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ And you've got me all figured out?
L474947 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.
L474945 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Oh, I wasn't worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
L474944 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.
L474935 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Now I know what a unicorn is, what do we do next?
L474934 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Well, Steve?
L474930 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ I feel good anyways.
L474929 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
L474928 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
L474927 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...
L474926 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
L474925 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Would they be good to eat?
L474924 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ How about California?
L474923 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No.
L474922 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
L474921 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
L474920 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ What do they look like?
L474919 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
L474918 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?
L474917 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
L474916 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ -- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
L474904 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
L474903 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ And that's tough, isn't it?
L474902 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ From A to Z. All you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words.
L474901 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Then I know my alphabet.
L474900 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ That's the end of the line.
L474899 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ What comes after Z?
L474806 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No. We're not stayin' --
L474805 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Aren't we stayin'?
L474680 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Okay. A-B-C -- D-E-F -- G-H-I --
L474679 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
L474678 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
L474677 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Why not? You went farther than that last time.
L474676 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Gee, I can't.
L474623 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Good night, Steve.
L474622 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Good night, Miss Wells.
L474620 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Oh no. Nobody said nothing to me. Only I got the idea that -- well Clay and me used to be walking through town and there was your place and through the window I could see you dancing, but Clay always took me over to the other side of the street.
L474619 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Did someone say I wasn't nice?
L474618 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ You're so nice.
L474617 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ That'd be swell.  You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be.
L474616 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Maybe I could start you out.
L474615 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ I sure would.
L474614 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Would you like to learn them?
L474612 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Don't you even know your letters?
L474611 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ It wasn't Clay's fault. We've been moving around most all the time -- mebbe when we get the ranch and stay in one place I can learn my letters then --
L474610 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ But he just never troubled to have you get any schooling?
L474609 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Since I can remember, Ma'am.
L474608 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
L474606 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
L474605 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
L474487 +++$+++ u2629 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I was at first. Then I was hanging on.  Are you going far?
L474486 +++$+++ u2632 +++$+++ m171 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Pleased to meet you, ma'am.  We found your trunk. Were you doin' the driven'?
L485452 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Shut up, you slut. You think you can take him from me? Well, over my dead body.
L485451 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Alex, what are you doing?
L485450 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No, I won't let you do it.
L485364 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Ha! Right bitch!
L485363 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I think he wants me.
L485362 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you say that?...  Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash.
L485353 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Wife?!
L485352 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I found a picture of his wife.
L485351 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
L485350 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
L484949 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ No, I haven't dated in a while. My last boyfriend's...
L484948 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?
L484947 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ That's always tough. How long were you together?
L484946 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
L484945 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Are you okay?
L484968 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.
L484967 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ That's it.
L484966 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ In room "302" at ten o'clock?
L484965 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Me, too. 101?
L484955 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Well, actually, we've never met officially, but I bumped into you at the cafeteria and you were so sweet. I said, "I'm sorry," and you said, "Watch it, white bitch, or I'll put my size eight in your ass." I thought how cool. I wear a size eight, too. Anyway, this is my best friend, Cindy.
L484954 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Do I know you?
L484953 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Hey, Brenda.
L485480 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Would you die already?!
L485479 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ My favorite memory was when we --
L485477 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Never happened!
L485476 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you --
L485475 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Okay... maybe that would be best.
L485474 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Oh... I guess I'll die now.
L485473 +++$+++ u2647 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
L485472 +++$+++ u2634 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever.
L485612 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!
L485611 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Cindy, what's going on?
L485527 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Okay.
L485526 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Oh my God, the ghost has Buddy! Brenda do something!
L485522 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Hey, I have an idea...
L485521 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.
L485514 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ What?! What is it, a monster?!
L485513 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ It's coming!
L485512 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.
L485511 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Oh my God! We're dead!
L485508 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me.
L485507 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Help!
L485153 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ No, you don't understand. It's here in these statues...
L485152 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
L485151 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Ouch!!
L484964 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Psychology.
L484963 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
L484962 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Thanks.
L484961 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
L484960 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Really? That's amazing.
L484959 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today.
L484958 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
L484957 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
L484956 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
L485148 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ He's not dead, you idiot. He lives in Florida. Now, shut up and let me finish.
L485147 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ But he could still be haunting the house. He's angry that he had to leave.
L485146 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
L485145 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
L485144 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
L485143 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
L485142 +++$+++ u2644 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
L485649 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Okay.
L485648 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Ray, run faster.
L485491 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back.
L485490 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Where's Shorty?
L485435 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ He's so brave.
L485434 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ He's right. I should go first.
L485252 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
L485251 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
L485243 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Yeah, me too.
L485242 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.
L485241 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You sure?
L485240 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ No, stay.
L485239 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ So, I guess I can go now.
L485238 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
L485237 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
L485236 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Ray, have you been here all this time?
L485235 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Shhh... It's okay.
L485024 +++$+++ u2635 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BRENDA +++$+++ Hello Ray.
L485023 +++$+++ u2645 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Hello Brenda.
L485724 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Hot dogs.
L485723 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I don't care. You pick.
L485722 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ What should we get?
L485721 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Yeah.  Can I borrow five bucks?
L485720 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
L485719 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Hey, wanna' share a soda?
L485718 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ That's what your man is supposed to do.
L485717 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
L485716 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Hey, look out, a bee!
L485715 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Let's get a hot dog.
L485714 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
L485713 +++$+++ u2636 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
L485712 +++$+++ u2637 +++$+++ m172 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Then what are we going to do?
