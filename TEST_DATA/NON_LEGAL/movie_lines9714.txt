L144600 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.
L144599 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Are you always so bold?
L144598 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ Not yet.
L144597 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
L144594 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ That would be much appreciated. Thanks.
L144593 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ We're through for the night, aren't we?  You go on.  Get some sleep. I'll stay until we can get a man out here and maybe catch a cab home.
L144589 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ MaryJane.  You think that logic and police procedure, order and science and method will hold back the horrors of a world gone mad and the sickness of the night.  I did once. But you know how he'll get caught? He'll have an accident, or some cop will get lucky.  You can't catch him by being intelligent and working hard.  Or the worst:  there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way, month after month.  The news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and in the city people lock their doors and windows, and hurry home before dark.  And then, one day, there are no more.  What happened?  Did he just stop?  Get tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more? Did he kill himself?  Did he die in an auto accident?  Or a fight.  Or get sick and die?  It's like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth.  And you never know.  But you keep asking yourself -- when you read about a new murder -- is he back?
L144588 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
L144587 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest of it?
L144558 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ He's brilliant.  This one is brilliant.
L144557 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ I just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran.  It just did that...
L144556 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ It's gone.  The file's not here.  What did you do?
L144550 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ Let me get a little action started here.
L144549 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ It's a game they like to play. Berkowitz -- "Son of Sam" -- hung around the crime scene, talking to the cops.  This one's probably watching <u>you</u>, laughing at you.
L144544 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ He can get into my computer any time he likes!  This is exactly the kind of thing I didn't want to have happen.
L144543 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ He's hacked into her Internet address.  He's a hacker.
L144542 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ That computer's wired into INTERNET.
L144510 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ In the sixties.  He's dead -- stabbed to death in prison.
L144509 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
L144508 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
L144402 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ You called us, Doctor, if you don't want to look at them here, how about downtown.  I'll drive you down...
L144401 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I don't want this.  What are they?
L144387 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think so.  If he's escaped we'd have the National Guard, cops'd be crawling through sewers.  You'd have a guard on your front door.
L144386 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank? Oh God, I <u>am</u>!  Make them some coffee.  Halloran, is it?  Investigator Goetz?  I had a crank call myself-- he said...  I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum.  I thought he might be out of prison.
L145160 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me...
L145159 +++$+++ u4637 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ SAKS +++$+++ You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
L145158 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
L145157 +++$+++ u4637 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ SAKS +++$+++ Just get out of your vehicle...
L145156 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
L145155 +++$+++ u4637 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ SAKS +++$+++ Ma'am, please get out of your vehicle...
L144851 +++$+++ u4637 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ SAKS +++$+++ We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's phone.  I know you won't mention it.
L144850 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Okay.
L144849 +++$+++ u4637 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ SAKS +++$+++ She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
L144848 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
L144847 +++$+++ u4637 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ SAKS +++$+++ Who prescribes the brandy?
L144846 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
L144845 +++$+++ u4637 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ SAKS +++$+++ We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
L144844 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...
L144843 +++$+++ u4637 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ SAKS +++$+++ I was just about to advise the Inspector here not to show Dr. Hudson the note.
L144842 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Someone broke into her place last night.  It wasn't connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so I haven't...
L144841 +++$+++ u4637 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ SAKS +++$+++ We don't see too many lady homicide detectives.  You have <u>my</u> respect. Have you discussed the note with Dr. Hudson?
L144840 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Over here.
L144839 +++$+++ u4637 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ SAKS +++$+++ Hello.  I am  Meryhew Saks.  The song is called "Murder By Numbers."  The performers are a group called The Police.  Adam here... ... from Behavioral Science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note.  This is an extremely complex case, and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around. We're not ruling out the possib- ility of three Copycat serial killers.  We have Quantico working on graphology, the Washington lap is cloning DNA from the secretor. It's our feeling that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the victims.  We have a team sweeping sperm banks.  Now I want to say a few word to you local people.  Your Commissioner asked for our assistance.  The Bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local police. We couldn't catch up on what you people know if we had a year.  We have nation-wide resources and hard state of the art forensic science; you have the local savvy.  Together we can be unbeatable.  Which one is Inspector Halloran?
L144294 +++$+++ u4632 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Lieutenant  Quinn.
L144293 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Who came in after you?
L144292 +++$+++ u4632 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
L144291 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later.
L144277 +++$+++ u4632 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ No.  I didn't.
L144276 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up anything?  Use the doorknob?  I don't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me.
L144275 +++$+++ u4632 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Michael Johnson.
L144274 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
L144273 +++$+++ u4632 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I was.
L145090 +++$+++ u4633 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ NIKKO +++$+++ Don't ever forget how good you are.
L145089 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Just horseshit luck.
L145088 +++$+++ u4633 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ NIKKO +++$+++ I heard. Good police work.
L144996 +++$+++ u4633 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ NIKKO +++$+++ Who gives a fuck?  In all the years I never seen you cry.  You loved him.
L144995 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.
L144994 +++$+++ u4633 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ NIKKO +++$+++ Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking drawer!  You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.  Every time... Want to hear something weird?  I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
L144993 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Quinn will be here any minute.  What are you going to say?
L144645 +++$+++ u4633 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ NIKKO +++$+++ Doped up kids all over town.  Park was full of them last night.  Very easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.
L144644 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?
L144485 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ God, you're cute when you're mad.
L144484 +++$+++ u4633 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ NIKKO +++$+++ Yeah, you did that too.  You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying.
L144483 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
L144482 +++$+++ u4633 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ NIKKO +++$+++ Yeah.  And you used that. Used <u>me</u>
L144481 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Well, you outranked <u>me</u>, Nikko.
L144480 +++$+++ u4633 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ NIKKO +++$+++ You're shitting ion your career.  You outrank hi...
L144479 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
L144478 +++$+++ u4633 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ NIKKO +++$+++ It's none of my business anymore...
L144475 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Oh, I know.
L144474 +++$+++ u4633 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ NIKKO +++$+++ Working late.  You're a damn fool.
L144328 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...
L144327 +++$+++ u4633 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ NIKKO +++$+++ Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
L144326 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Because it's your job, that's all.
L144325 +++$+++ u4633 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ NIKKO +++$+++ What am I wasting my time with this shit for?
L144956 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ I gotta get something to eat, I haven't eaten all day.
L144955 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll be in the jail when you wind this up...
L144938 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ Talk to Nikko...!
L144937 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
L144936 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ The woman was in shock.  She was totally out on ranks.  I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack.  Stop that, you son of a bitch!  The place wasn't secure.  I was doing my goddamn job!  And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room.
L144766 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Helen... excuse me, we...
L144765 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ She wants me to check the phone booth for a note.
L144757 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Bunch of Swedish women.  You're too young.
L144756 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ What's Abba?
L144664 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ The woman's unstable.  You could wind up with a harassment charge. <u>Anything</u>.  You're like some horny little teenager.
L144663 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ It's against your rules that I try to help a witness who's scared shitless?  Who's...
L144662 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ You damn well better start working on that impulse control.  A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of <u>evidence</u>?
L144661 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do you...
L144660 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Now listen up, Ruben.  You never, never, never mess with somebody <u>inside</u> the case!
L144652 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ Look at him, grandstanding...
L144651 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
L144650 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Yeah, everything's different.
L144649 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure.
L144648 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on report.
L144641 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ Spread out like she was sexually assaulted here.
L144640 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Look at her legs.
L144639 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ She's blue as hell.  No marks on her neck.  Asphyxiated?  not the same -- no ligature marks.  Outdoors...
L144637 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ Needle marks, fresh, here.  look at this...
L144636 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ What about her arms?
L144635 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ She didn't fight back, no hair or skin under her fingernails.  I'm not seeing any bruises or contusions...
L144632 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Quinn decided we should form a task force -- they're all one case, now. He wants all the senior detectives on it...  She wasn't killed here.
L144631 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ Is Niccoletti <u>assigned</u> here?
L144583 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ My promise.
L144582 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ Absolutely.
L144548 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Why would he send this to Helen Hudson...
L144547 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ You got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape...
L144521 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Let's get out of here...
L144520 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ You said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? This doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that?
L144492 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Tell it to your shrink.
L144491 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ I like women like that!
L144490 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Honest to God, Ruben!
L144489 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ Nada.  Lemme make the call.
L144488 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
L144487 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ What's wrong with him?
L144417 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Order Chinese for us and meet me the library?  Anything but beef.
L144416 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ You came in there with this attitude...
L144415 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Sure.  She likes <u>you</u>, Rube.  She likes the way you move.  She sure as hell isn't in love with me.
L144414 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ Classy madonna.
L144413 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Snotty neurotic bitch...
L144331 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
L144330 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
L144258 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ You know, M.J., when I watch you shoot, I realize I've got a little problem with my stance... could you just move over here and critique my legs?
L144257 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ You're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone.  I joined the cops to save lives, not waste them.
L144254 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
L144253 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Answer it.
L144246 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ Yeah, but she had divine guidance.
L144245 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.
L145218 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ No, she can come in tomorrow... gonna want to know a lot of things...
L145217 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ She's in no shape to give her statement tonight...
L145047 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ "Spokes<u>person</u>."
L145046 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ That was Bundy.  He killed forty of them, identical, long hair, parted in the middle, alike as Barbie dolls.  ...this is hopeless.  Let's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning?
L145001 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ So I'm maybe gonna lose three good cops?  You fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself.  There's something I want you to think about.  The book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. You tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive.  To what end?  You're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop.  Go get drunk.  I am.
L145000 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ You want mine, too?  You take his, you take mine.  I'm the one fucked it up...
L144953 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ Nikko?
L144952 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Give me Ruben back...
L144951 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ Saks.  If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
L144950 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Or the F.B.I.?
L144949 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ You have no authority to make a deal like that.  That' s for the D.A...
L144948 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
L144947 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ How'd you get in on the deal?
L144946 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ You got a suspect...
L144945 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect...
L144941 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ I gotta have Ruben, and a...
L144940 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted just the bastards dumping them in the harbor.  What's keeping those bums at Immigration?  Nightmare in here...
L144858 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Give him <u>that</u>pompous son of a bitch.
L144857 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?
L144856 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
L144855 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline.
L144854 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ What does this mean?  Now we got the FBI, my team is expendable? I'm working my ass off, is anybody listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He and Nikko don't even get on together...
L144853 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ M.J., I'm going to have to borrow Ruben.  The alien-smuggling thing in Chinatown is going down tomorrow night and Jack's kid got hit by a car.  I gotta give Ruben to Nikko.
L144690 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Because I think I'm wrong.
L144689 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ What the hell you need her for?
L144688 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Helen Hudson...
L144687 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ Where you going?
L144686 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ I'm sorry it had to come to your attention.  I am dealing with it.
L144685 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ Okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? What the hell is going on?  You got no discipline in your operation.
L144684 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ You're damn right I do.
L144683 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
L144682 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
L144681 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ So what have we got?
L144566 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ With the F.B.I. there's no such thing as a little help.  They bury you with help.  Explain to me about this virus, no don't tell me about the virus.  Thing is, you saw it, the pictures.
L144565 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ We could use a little help.
L144564 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!"
L144563 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Oh, maaaaan?!
L144529 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.
L144528 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
L144527 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ I know.  Get out here.
L144526 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
L144525 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ Who've I got to beat up except the messenger?  Does this give us anything to go on?
L144524 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Don't swear at me because we got problems.  I'm just giving you the news.  I went to a Catholic school; I'll tell you what they teach.  On the knuckles they teach.
L144458 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Yessir.  I have reflected on that, sir.  Which explains my gushing deference to you, sir.
L144457 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib?
L144456 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Yessir.
L144455 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ Sergeant?
L144454 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ That's always your privilege, sir.
L144453 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ How about I put Nikko on it?
L144452 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help.
L144451 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ I'm <U>telling</u> you.  Don't you <u>ever</u> address me publicly in that tone. You'll work what and <u>who</u> I tell you to work.
L144450 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ Would you step outside, Sergeant?
L144449 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
L144448 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
L144447 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
L144446 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ There was no sperm.
L144317 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Good.
L144316 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ We're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the Grateful Dead!  Sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass.
L144315 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Right.
L144314 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose.
L144313 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Right.
L144312 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ You didn't say serial killer and I didn't say serial killer.
L144308 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ I said you were...
L144307 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not.
L144306 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ I tagged the goddamned stocking. It ain't lost.  We're sequestering that evidence.  That's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into...
L144303 +++$+++ u4635 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ QUINN +++$+++ Shut up.
L144302 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ You messed with the scene.
L144658 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ We're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement...
L144657 +++$+++ u4638 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the Boston Strangler?  This is the fourth, is that correct?
L144655 +++$+++ u4638 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?
L144654 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Detective Niccoletti?
L144305 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ You messed with the evidence.
