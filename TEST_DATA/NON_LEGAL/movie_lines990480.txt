L636211 +++$+++ u8724 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ HOCKNEY +++$+++ I'm sure you can understand my hesitation.
L635968 +++$+++ u8723 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ FENSTER +++$+++ Why you gotta go and do that? I'm trying to make a point.
L635967 +++$+++ u8724 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ HOCKNEY +++$+++ You are a criminal.
L635966 +++$+++ u8723 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ FENSTER +++$+++ You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.
L636494 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Doubtful. With all that coke, they'll be ready - which brings me to sunny spot number two. Even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat, we get nothing.
L636493 +++$+++ u8724 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ HOCKNEY +++$+++ Can we stealth these guys?
L636492 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty.
L636458 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Dig.
L636457 +++$+++ u8724 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ HOCKNEY +++$+++ Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him.
L635999 +++$+++ u8724 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ HOCKNEY +++$+++ What do you care what he says?
L635998 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Why don't you just calm down'
L635988 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you guys knew him.
L635987 +++$+++ u8724 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ HOCKNEY +++$+++ How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
L635986 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ He's alright.
L635971 +++$+++ u8724 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ HOCKNEY +++$+++ The word I got is you hung up your spurs, man. What's that all  about?
L635970 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ You heard right.
L636498 +++$+++ u8724 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ HOCKNEY +++$+++ If I'm going in, I want a stake.
L636497 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Did you hear what he just said?
L636496 +++$+++ u8724 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ HOCKNEY +++$+++ Me too.
L636460 +++$+++ u8724 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ HOCKNEY +++$+++ I can run. I got no problem with that.
L636459 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ What are we gonna do?
L635990 +++$+++ u8724 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ HOCKNEY +++$+++ Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
L635989 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Roger really. People say I talk too much.
L635951 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .
L635950 +++$+++ u8724 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ HOCKNEY +++$+++ I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.
L636514 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Just do what I tell you.
L636513 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ What if I
L636512 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
L636511 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Keaton, I can't just -
L636503 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Hungarian?
L636502 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Russian, I think. I don't know.
L636501 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ What-are they speaking?
L636372 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Who's Keyser Soze?
L636371 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ What is this?
L636314 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
L636313 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ What is it Keaton?
L636219 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ We'll make it.
L636218 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
L636217 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ We'll make it.
L636188 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Not if we do it my way.
L636187 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ No killing?
L636186 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Maybe more.
L636185 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Three million?
L636184 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
L636183 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Fenster and Hockney?
L636182 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
L636181 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ How are they going to do it?
L636180 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Forget it.  I'11 probably shit blood tonight.
L636179 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Well, I'm sorry.
L636178 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ I'11 be alright.
L636177 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ You okay?
L636176 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ I was out of line.
L636174 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool.
L636173 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ You watch your mouth.
L636170 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Don't tell me you don't need this. Is this your place?
L636169 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Tough break.
L636168 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.
L636167 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ What's with you? What do you care whether I come or not?
L636166 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ You have to come.
L636165 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Never heard of him.
L636164 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
L636163 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ What fence? Who?
L636162 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.
L636161 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
L636158 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill you.
L636157 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Don't hurt me.
L636156 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ If you'll just let me -
L636155 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Get out.
L636144 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more.
L636143 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things -
L636142 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -
L636141 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ What the hell do you want?
L636136 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at
L636135 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ How do you do?
L635994 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ I walked. Ninety days, suspended.
L635993 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
L635992 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ County. I was in for fraud.
L635991 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
L635960 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Hey, that was your mistake, not mine. Did you ever think to ask me? I've been
L635959 +++$+++ u8733 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ You know damn well, dead-man.
L635958 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ with what?
L635905 +++$+++ u8733 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ This I had to see myself.
L635904 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Let's say for example -
L635870 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ What time is it?
L635869 +++$+++ u8733 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Ready?
L635868 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
L635867 +++$+++ u8733 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ How are you, Keaton?
L636487 +++$+++ u8726 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KOBAYASHI +++$+++ Am I? 92 92    INT. HALLWAY - FIFTIETH FLOOR
L636486 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ You're lying.
L636485 +++$+++ u8726 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KOBAYASHI +++$+++ No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.
L636484 +++$+++ u8726 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KOBAYASHI +++$+++ Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case personally. She flew out yesterday.
L636483 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ What did you say?
L636481 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ We'll see.
L636480 +++$+++ u8726 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KOBAYASHI +++$+++ I am sorry, Mr. McManus.  f implore you to believe me, Mr. Keaton. Mr. Soze is very real and very                             + determined.
L636478 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Neither do we.
L636477 +++$+++ u8726 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KOBAYASHI +++$+++ Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.
L636476 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
L636475 +++$+++ u8726 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KOBAYASHI +++$+++ Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.
L636474 +++$+++ u8726 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KOBAYASHI +++$+++ A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.
L636473 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
L636472 +++$+++ u8726 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KOBAYASHI +++$+++ Mr. Soze will be most -
L636471 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ The answer is no.
L636384 +++$+++ u8726 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KOBAYASHI +++$+++ Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
L636383 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ What about Redfoot?
L636382 +++$+++ u8726 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KOBAYASHI +++$+++ Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
L636381 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ You set up the line-up.
L636370 +++$+++ u8726 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KOBAYASHI +++$+++ I work for Keyser Sate.
L636369 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
L636368 +++$+++ u8726 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KOBAYASHI +++$+++ My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
L636367 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Who's your boss?
L636366 +++$+++ u8726 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KOBAYASHI +++$+++ My employer requires your services. One job. One day's work. Very dangerous. I don't expect all of you to live, but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit.
L636339 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Tell him we'll meet.
L636338 +++$+++ u8731 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ REDFOOT +++$+++ He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him'
L636337 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ We want to meet him.
L636336 +++$+++ u8731 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ REDFOOT +++$+++ Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
L636335 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Who is he?
L636334 +++$+++ u8731 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ REDFOOT +++$+++ The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.
L636333 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ You didn't know.
L636332 +++$+++ u8731 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ REDFOOT +++$+++ Get a grip. I didn't know.
L636310 +++$+++ u8731 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ REDFOOT +++$+++ Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
L636309 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ A little of both.
L636308 +++$+++ u8731 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ REDFOOT +++$+++ Business or personal?
L636307 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.
L636306 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ I shivved him.
L636305 +++$+++ u8731 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ REDFOOT +++$+++ I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.
L636304 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
L636303 +++$+++ u8731 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ REDFOOT +++$+++ Take your time. Enjoy L.A.
L636298 +++$+++ u8731 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ REDFOOT +++$+++ I've got a ton of work and no good people.
L636297 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ We're on vacation.
L636626 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Nothing. Something I - forget it.
L636625 +++$+++ u8729 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ RAB IN +++$+++ What?
L636624 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
L636623 +++$+++ u8729 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ RAB IN +++$+++ Waste of time.
L636622 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ I'11 find him.
L636621 +++$+++ u8729 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ RAB IN +++$+++ Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
L636620 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
L636619 +++$+++ u8729 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ RAB IN +++$+++ Which is shit.
L636618 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.
L636047 +++$+++ u8729 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ RAB IN +++$+++ Where?
L636046 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Someplace else, then.
L636045 +++$+++ u8729 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ RAB IN +++$+++ He won't go into the interrogation room.
L636041 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ I want to see him.
L636040 +++$+++ u8729 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ RAB IN +++$+++ Two hours, tops.
L636039 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ When does he post bail?
L636037 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ What'the fuck is that?
L636036 +++$+++ u8729 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ RAB IN +++$+++ Weapons. Misdemeanor two.
L636035 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Did they charge him with anything?
L636034 +++$+++ u8729 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ RAB IN +++$+++ The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
L636033 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ What do you mean I can't see him?
L636528 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Kobayashi.
L636527 +++$+++ u8730 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ RABIN +++$+++ His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.
L636053 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
L636052 +++$+++ u8730 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ RABIN +++$+++ That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.
L636051 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ You know damn well what I think.
L636050 +++$+++ u8730 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ RABIN +++$+++ And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
L636049 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
L636048 +++$+++ u8730 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ RABIN +++$+++ No, no, no, no, no.
L636044 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time.
L636043 +++$+++ u8730 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ RABIN +++$+++ Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired
L636613 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's
L636612 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.
L636611 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.
L636610 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.
L636609 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ I'm not bait. No way. I post today.
L636608 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.
L636607 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ You think he's..?
L636606 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ You're not safe on your own.
L636605 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ You know what it's like, Agent Kujan, to know you'll never be good? Not good like you. You got good all fucked around. I mean a stand up guy. I grew up knowing I was never going to be good at anything 'cause I was a cripple. Shit, I wasn't
L636604 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Why lie about everything else, then?
L636603 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe he's dead. Christ
L636602 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning.
L636601 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ If he's dead, Verbal - if what you say is true, then it won't matter. It was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth.
L636598 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ He programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to. Customs has been
L636597 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ I knew him. He would never -
L636596 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.
L636595 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ This is all bullshit.
L636594 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.
L636593 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Edie...
L636591 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.
L636590 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
L636588 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ NO.
L636587 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Keaton was Keyser Soze
L636586 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ No...
L636585 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ No, Verbal. You weren't friends. Keaton didn't have friends. He saved you because he wanted it that way. It was his will.
L636584 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Because he was my friend.
L636583 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
L636582 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Edie.
L636581 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'
L636580 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ He wanted me to live.
L636579 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Verbal, he left you behind for a reason. If you all knew Soze could find you anywhere, why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat?
L636577 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent                  t us to kill someone?
L636576 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death.
L636575 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ I don't
L636574 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.
L636573 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ I said I never heard of him.
L636572 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.
L636571 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ I never heard of him.
L636570 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
L636564 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan. I mean the Devil himself. How do you shoot the Devil in the back?
L636563 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ But Keaton...
