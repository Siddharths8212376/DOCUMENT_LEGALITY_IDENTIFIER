L207010 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Chicken!
L207009 +++$+++ u904 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ DAMONE +++$+++ No. I don't think so. Not right now.
L207006 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Really.
L207005 +++$+++ u904 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ DAMONE +++$+++ Poor guy.
L206897 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Okay. See ya.
L206896 +++$+++ u904 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ DAMONE +++$+++ Well, I've gotta be running.
L206895 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike Damone.
L206894 +++$+++ u904 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ DAMONE +++$+++ I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
L206893 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Damone! You come here?
L206892 +++$+++ u904 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ DAMONE +++$+++ Hey, Mark. Is that you?
L206885 +++$+++ u904 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ DAMONE +++$+++ I'm really pretty busy...
L206884 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Damone, are you there?
L206883 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
L206882 +++$+++ u904 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ DAMONE +++$+++ Did you go home and get it?
L206881 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
L206880 +++$+++ u904 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ DAMONE +++$+++ Mark. What happened to your date?
L206879 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Damone. It's Mark.
L206878 +++$+++ u904 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ DAMONE +++$+++ Yo.
L206856 +++$+++ u904 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ DAMONE +++$+++ You wuss. It's no problem. One person says something to the other and that's how it starts...
L206855 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
L206854 +++$+++ u904 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ DAMONE +++$+++ And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
L206850 +++$+++ u904 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ DAMONE +++$+++ All right. Pay attention.
L206849 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
L206848 +++$+++ u904 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ DAMONE +++$+++ What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
L206847 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.
L206750 +++$+++ u904 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ DAMONE +++$+++ Ace the jacket.
L206749 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Yeah?
L206748 +++$+++ u904 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ DAMONE +++$+++ Hey, Rat.
L206737 +++$+++ u904 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ DAMONE +++$+++ There used to be three or four of those guys. Now we see 'em every time we come to the mall.
L206736 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
L206735 +++$+++ u904 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ DAMONE +++$+++ The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith.
L206658 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.
L206657 +++$+++ u904 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ DAMONE +++$+++ That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
L206656 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.
L206655 +++$+++ u904 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ DAMONE +++$+++ Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.
L206653 +++$+++ u904 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ DAMONE +++$+++ Okay. Okay.  Here's what you do.
L206652 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
L206651 +++$+++ u904 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ DAMONE +++$+++ I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
L206650 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Really?
L206649 +++$+++ u904 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ DAMONE +++$+++ I would. Yeah.
L206648 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
L206647 +++$+++ u904 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ DAMONE +++$+++ It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
L206646 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ No. It's too soon.
L206645 +++$+++ u904 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ DAMONE +++$+++ Did you get her name?
L206644 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ No.
L206643 +++$+++ u904 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ DAMONE +++$+++ Did you get her number?
L206642 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ She's in my biology class.
L206641 +++$+++ u904 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ DAMONE +++$+++ All right... where did you see her?
L206640 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Damone, you gotta listen to me.
L206639 +++$+++ u904 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ DAMONE +++$+++ It's definitely your mama.
L206638 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
L206637 +++$+++ u904 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ DAMONE +++$+++ You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
L206438 +++$+++ u904 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ DAMONE +++$+++ You should work for yourself.
L206437 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Do you ever look at those girls who work at Swenson's? They're beautiful. And I have to stand out here and watch them six nights a week.
L206486 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either.
L206485 +++$+++ u906 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
L206484 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Not if you're over sixteen.
L206483 +++$+++ u906 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ And they don't call my parents?
L206482 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.
L206479 +++$+++ u906 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ I'm Carrie Frazier from Toys 'R Us. Judy Hinton from May Company told me I could ask you something.
L206478 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Yes.
L206477 +++$+++ u906 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ Are you Linda Barrett?
L206813 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ Merv, I'm thinking... I've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards.
L206812 +++$+++ u907 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ GRIFFIN +++$+++ What's going through your mind right here, Jeff? The danger of it all?
L206811 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ Totally.
L206810 +++$+++ u907 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ GRIFFIN +++$+++ Are you going to ride that wave?
L206809 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ That's me, Merv.
L206808 +++$+++ u907 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ GRIFFIN +++$+++ Who's that?
L206807 +++$+++ u907 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ GRIFFIN +++$+++ Fascinating.
L206806 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning.
L206805 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?
L206804 +++$+++ u907 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ GRIFFIN +++$+++ I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us?
L206803 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ I don't go at all.
L206802 +++$+++ u907 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ GRIFFIN +++$+++ How often do you go?
L206801 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
L206800 +++$+++ u907 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ GRIFFIN +++$+++ I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
L206799 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
L206798 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ I've been swimming, Merv.
L206797 +++$+++ u907 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ GRIFFIN +++$+++ I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
L206796 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
L206795 +++$+++ u907 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ GRIFFIN +++$+++ How've you been?
L207331 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but...
L207330 +++$+++ u909 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ L.C. +++$+++ That's him! He did it!
L206959 +++$+++ u909 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ L.C. +++$+++ You can't fix this car, Spicoli.
L206958 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
L206957 +++$+++ u909 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ L.C. +++$+++ First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
L206956 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
L206955 +++$+++ u909 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ L.C. +++$+++ My brother is gonna shit.
L206954 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ Just be glad you're all right.
L206953 +++$+++ u909 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ L.C. +++$+++ My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.
L206949 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
L206948 +++$+++ u909 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ L.C. +++$+++ We just missed the turnoff to the party.
L206946 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
L206945 +++$+++ u909 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ L.C. +++$+++ My brother's car!
L206944 +++$+++ u909 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ L.C. +++$+++ They're fuckin' with us.
L206943 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
L206941 +++$+++ u909 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ L.C. +++$+++ This ain't no cop.
L206940 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ What the fuck is this guy doing?
L206936 +++$+++ u909 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ L.C. +++$+++ I like sex.
L206935 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ All right.
L206934 +++$+++ u909 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ L.C. +++$+++ Suzanne Somers' tits.
L206933 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ Naw. Any good?
L206932 +++$+++ u909 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ L.C. +++$+++ Seen the new Playboy?
L206931 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ Then don't hassle it.
L206930 +++$+++ u909 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ L.C. +++$+++ He is.
L206929 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ I thought he was out of town.
L206928 +++$+++ u909 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ L.C. +++$+++ Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.
L207305 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Hey -- Doug Stallworth? It's his loss.
L207304 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
L207303 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
L207302 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
L207301 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Dartmouth?!
L207300 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Well I might go to Dartmouth.
L207299 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ But what are you going to do?
L207298 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Yeah, like maybe never.
L207297 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Sometime?
L207296 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
L207295 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Not coming? What happened?
L207294 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ He's not coming.
L207293 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Where's Doug?
L207256 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.
L207255 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ I want romance.
L207254 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ What do you want?
L207253 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
L207252 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
L207251 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Another summer of working at Swenson's.
L207209 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!
L207208 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
L207207 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
L207206 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ I paid for it and everything.
L207205 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ That little prick.
L207204 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
L207203 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ That little prick.
L207202 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
L207153 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ You're right. I didn't tell you that.
L207152 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.
L207151 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ What?
L207150 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.
L207149 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too.
L207148 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
L207147 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
L207146 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
L207145 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ It couldn't be.
L207144 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ What do you think it is?
L207143 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ What do you think it is?
L207142 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ I don't know... I just don't feel right.
L207141 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
L207140 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
L207139 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
L207012 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.
L207011 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
L207004 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
L207003 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ God, he hardly even talks anymore.
L206994 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ No.
L206993 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
L206992 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I think they're both virgins.
L206991 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ What do you think?
L206986 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.
L206985 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ What's Doug do in Chicago?
L206984 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
L206983 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ How long does Doug take?
L206981 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Listen to this... it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex, but they don't have real orgasms.'
L206980 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ No. But it's a nice idea.
L206979 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Does that ever happen?
L206978 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Climax together.
L206977 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
L206976 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
L206975 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
L206974 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
L206973 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
L206972 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Why don't you put your mother's secret book back?
L206971 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
L206970 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
L206837 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Sixteen.
L206836 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
L206835 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner.
L206733 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Thanks a lot.
L206732 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
L206731 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
L206730 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.
L206729 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
L206727 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Not since November.
L206726 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
L206725 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
L206724 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.

L206698 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.

L206696 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
