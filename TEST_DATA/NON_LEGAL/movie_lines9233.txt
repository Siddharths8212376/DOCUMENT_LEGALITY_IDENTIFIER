L357332 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Then everything is quite all right, isn't it?
L357331 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course.
L357330 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?
L357329 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ I surprise you? Now that's news.
L357328 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
L357327 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
L357326 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
L357325 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Very often.
L357324 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
L357323 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
L357322 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ You're startled?
L357321 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ 108 and still active?
L357320 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
L357319 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Well, is it?
L357318 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
L357317 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Well, they didn't actually mean that.
L357316 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
L357315 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ He amputated his own leg?
L357314 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
L357313 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ When was all this?
L357312 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
L357311 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Who?
L357310 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
L357309 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
L357308 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
L357307 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ —buy and sell?
L357306 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
L357305 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them?
L357304 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Of course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.
L357303 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
L357302 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Centuries.
L357301 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Well, it must have taken–
L357300 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ They were.
L357299 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?
L357296 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ You'd be surprised, my dear Conway, how a little courtesy all around helps to smooth out the most complicated problems.
L357295 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
L357294 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
L357293 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
L357292 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
L357291 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ You have no disputes over women?
L357290 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
L357289 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
L357288 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Oh, good heavens, no!
L357287 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
L357286 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
L357285 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ That's intelligent.
L357284 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including—  —the excess of virtue itself.
L357283 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ We follow many.
L357282 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ By the way, what religion do you follow here?
L357275 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
L357274 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
L357273 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ There are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss.
L357272 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ For a man who talks a great deal, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be.
L357271 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ In time you will meet them all.
L357270 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Who, for instance?
L357269 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Oh, yes.
L357268 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ So there are others?
L357267 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Goodness, no!
L357266 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
L357265 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La.
L357203 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
L357202 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ And the wine - excellent.
L357160 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Thank you.
L357159 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
L357154 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
L357153 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Where is your mad pilot?
L357150 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ You've no idea, sir, how unexpected and very welcome you are. My friends and I - and the lady in the plane - left Baskul night before last for Shanghai, but we suddenly found ourselves traveling in the opposite direction—
L357149 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ How do you do?
L357148 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ And mine's Conway.
L357193 +++$+++ u1895 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me!  Go on, beat it. Beat it!
L357192 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
L357191 +++$+++ u1895 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
L357190 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Please let me help you.
L357189 +++$+++ u1895 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
L357188 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
L357187 +++$+++ u1895 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
L357186 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
L357185 +++$+++ u1895 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ You get out of here! If any of you men think you can come busting in here-
L357184 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
L357183 +++$+++ u1895 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ What do you want?
L357582 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Thank you.
L357581 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Oh, thank you. Thank you!
L357580 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Then it's done.
L357579 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Oh, immediately.
L357578 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
L357577 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
L357576 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Splendid!
L357575 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
L357574 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Now, what would you like to do?
L357573 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ "Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."
L357572 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Why, no.
L357571 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"—  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "
L357570 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Oh, I'm so glad.
L357569 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.
L357568 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ You've very kind Mr. Lovett.
L357567 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
L357566 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Yes.
L357565 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.
L357402 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
L357401 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.
L357224 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
L357223 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ What exactly do you mean by "almost any time now"?
L357216 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ No.
L357215 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ No porters here!!
L357214 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
L357213 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.
L357617 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You've been lying to us ever since we got here! Apparently it's worked with some people. Perhaps it's because they lack the courage to do anything about it. But not me, Chang. You're up against the wrong man. I'll get out of here, if I have to blow this fantastic place into the valley! I'll get out—porters or no porters!
L357616 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't—
L357615 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
L357406 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out.
L357405 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
L357222 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ In that respect, you are exceedingly fortunate. We are expecting a shipment from them almost any time now—
L357221 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ How can we get in touch with them?
L357220 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.
L357212 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Oh, dear.
L357211 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ As far away as I ever want to be.
L357210 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Are you so certain you are away from it?
L357209 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
L357156 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Pardon me—
L357155 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ We were just going to bury him when you came along.
L357761 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Hey!
L357760 +++$+++ u1899 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
L357743 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
L357742 +++$+++ u1899 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ Are you taking me?
L357734 +++$+++ u1899 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.
L357733 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ You're lying, aren't you?
L357730 +++$+++ u1899 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ I thought so!  He tells everyone I'm old. He wants them to stay away from me. He can't stand it when anyone comes near. He's punished me for every minute I've spent with George. If it weren't for him, I would have been out of here long ago, but he always stops me. Six months ago, I tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room. I nearly went crazy.  Look at me, Mr. Conway, do I look like an old woman? Is this the skin of an old woman? Look into my eyes and see if these are the eyes of an old woman?
L357729 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Yes.
L357728 +++$+++ u1899 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
L357727 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
L357726 +++$+++ u1899 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
L357725 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Father Perrault is dead.
L357724 +++$+++ u1899 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
L357723 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
L357722 +++$+++ u1899 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
L357721 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
L357720 +++$+++ u1899 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?
L357435 +++$+++ u1896 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ HIGH LAMA +++$+++ We have reason. It is the entire meaning and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to me in a vision, long, long, ago. I saw all the nations strengthening, not in wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and the will to destroy. I saw their machine power multiply until a single weaponed man might match a whole army. I foresaw a time when man, exulting in the technique of murder, would rage so hotly over the world that every book, every treasure, would be doomed to destruction. This vision was so vivid and so moving that I determined to gather together all the things of beauty and culture that I could and preserve them here against the doom toward which the world is rushing.  Look at the world today! Is there anything more pitiful?  What madness there is, what blindness, what unintelligent leadership! A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity crashing headlong against each other, propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality. The time must come, my friend, when this orgy will spend itself, when brutality and the lust for power must perish by its own sword. Against that time is why I avoided death and am here, and why you were brought here. For when that day comes, the world must begin to look for a new life. And it is our hope that they may find it here. For here we shall be with their books and their music and a way of life based on one simple rule: Be Kind.  When that day comes, it is our hope that the brotherly love of Shangri-La will spread throughout the world.  Yes, my son, when the strong have devoured each other, the Christian ethic may at last be fulfilled, and the meek shall inherit the earth.
L357434 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
L357433 +++$+++ u1896 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ HIGH LAMA +++$+++ We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
L357432 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
L357431 +++$+++ u1896 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ HIGH LAMA +++$+++ Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
L357430 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Oh, the girl at the piano?
L357429 +++$+++ u1896 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ HIGH LAMA +++$+++ Sondra Bizet.
L357428 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
L357427 +++$+++ u1896 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ HIGH LAMA +++$+++ That Conway seemed to belong here. In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.
L357425 +++$+++ u1896 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ HIGH LAMA +++$+++ Sit down, my son.  You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.
L357424 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago—  —you're still alive, Father Perrault!
L357423 +++$+++ u1896 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ HIGH LAMA +++$+++ What is it, my son?
L357422 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ It's astonishing - and incredible, but—
L357421 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as—
L357420 +++$+++ u1896 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ HIGH LAMA +++$+++ I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
L357419 +++$+++ u1896 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ HIGH LAMA +++$+++ Yes.
L357418 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Are you the High Lama?
L357417 +++$+++ u1896 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ HIGH LAMA +++$+++ Sit here, near me. I am an old man and can do no one any harm.
L357627 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Do you think this will come in my time?
L357626 +++$+++ u1897 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LAMA +++$+++ I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.
L357624 +++$+++ u1897 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LAMA +++$+++ Because, my son, I am placing in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La.  For I am going to die.
L357623 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Mine?
L357622 +++$+++ u1897 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LAMA +++$+++ You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
L357621 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
L357620 +++$+++ u1897 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LAMA +++$+++ Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
L357763 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child.
L357762 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
L357759 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  Come on.
L357758 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.
L357750 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
L357749 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ was saying—
L357748 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ What was that?
L357747 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Lucky thing for me you snapped out of it, too. You saved my life. I never could have made it alone.
L357741 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Come on! We're wasting time!
L357740 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
L357739 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ What about the others?
L357738 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yes, everything!
L357737 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ The clothes?
L357736 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yes.
L357735 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ You say the porters are waiting for us?
L357732 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ I don't believe it! I can't believe it. She's lying.  You're lying. You're lying! Every word you've been saying is a lie! Come on, say it!
L357731 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were, Bob.
L357714 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ All right. I'll prove it to you! You believe everything they've told you - without proof! I'll prove my story!
L357713 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
L357712 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
L357711 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know anyway.  I found out a lot of things last night.  I'm not ashamed of it either. It's probably one of the few decent things that's ever happened in this hellish place.
L357710 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ You're wrong, George.
L357709 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty!
L357708 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ She came here in 1888!
L357707 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
L357706 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
L357705 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Why not?
L357704 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ You can't take her away from here!
L357702 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ She's going with me.
L357701 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ What's she got to do with it?
L357700 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yes, the little Russian girl.
L357699 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Maria?
L357698 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
L357697 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean?
L357696 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Well, I can't think of anything more to say. Goodbye, Bob.
L357695 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
L357694 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'd go mad!
L357693 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
