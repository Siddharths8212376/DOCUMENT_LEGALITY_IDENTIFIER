L662718 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Oh my God...we’re buried alive...
L662708 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ No.
L662707 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ You don’t take no for an answer, do you?
L662706 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Always wanted to see the upper lines.
L662705 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor will drive you back.
L662698 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
L662697 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially King’s daughter.
L662696 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ That’s every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  That’s why you’re here, isn’t it? You think I can’t do it. You think I’m going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
L662695 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ The killer doesn’t want to see this pipeline continue, doesn’t want to see you take over...
L662694 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ If you’ve come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you.  I have two bodyguards, I don’t need a third...
L662693 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ It’s not the pin your father wore. It’s an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
L662692 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
L662691 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ It’s my father’s pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
L662690 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Does this look familiar to you?
L662689 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
L662688 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ How long has he been with you?
L662687 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. He’s decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette.
L662686 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Who is he?
L662683 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Partially, yes.
L662682 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
L662681 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I don’t want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  I’m not sure he knew that.
L662680 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Funerals aren’t exactly memorable.
L662679 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ I haven’t been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
L662678 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Yes.
L662677 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ I met you at my father’s funeral.
L663101 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ I’d heard there were some renovations there...no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years.
L663100 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ How appropriate.
L663099 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ The Maiden’s Tower.
L663069 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
L663068 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Mother of God.
L663043 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Istanbul.
L663042 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Where?
L663041 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ So.  My way.  No MI-6, no Interpol.  Just you, me and my people.
L663036 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!
L663035 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
L663034 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ No!  Get me out!
L663033 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Where’s the sub going?!
L663030 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ A special job.  A...a...a submarine.
L663029 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ And the payoff on the tables?
L663028 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Alright, alright!  Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her.  Russian stuff.
L663024 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ No.  The truth!  She thought I was dead -- those blades were meant for you.  What do you know that she would kill you for?
L663023 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ A rope!
L663022 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Now...where were we?
L663018 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ You are out of your league.  She’s working with Renard.
L663017 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!
L663016 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.
L663015 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didn’t even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
L663014 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ I thought you were the one in her business.
L663013 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ What’s your business with Elektra King?
L663012 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Really Bond, couldn’t you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
L663011 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Ah, I see.  A purely...plutonic relationship.
L663010 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ She’s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
L663009 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
L662766 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline.
L662765 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
L662764 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ How high up does this...arms dealing go?
L662763 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.
L662761 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me.
L662760 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Where did you get this?
L662759 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
L662758 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ What?  This is not possible.
L662757 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
L662756 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ See?  You’re upsetting my customers. What do you want?
L662751 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Have some of the rat’s nest caviar.  From my own fishery.  They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House.
L662750 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rat’s nest.
L662749 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Bond, I’m a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal family’s, now it’s mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
L662748 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ You, of course. I need some information.
L662747 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
L662746 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Valentin Zukovsky.
L663064 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ C-class.
L663063 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ What class sub does your nephew run?
L663062 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
L663059 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
L663058 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ What is this place?
L663038 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ Bond!
L663037 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ No! Bond!
L663032 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
L663031 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ What?
L663087 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.
L663086 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Someone will come.
L663085 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if they’re coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.
L663001 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Is nothing.  His kingdom he stole from my mother. The kingdom I will rightly take back.
L663000 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Your father...
L662999 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didn’t think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
L662965 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Please.
L662964 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Perhaps this isn’t the time...
L662890 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Could...could you come?
L662889 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ I’ll send someone out.
L663141 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ Yes.  Au revoir...
L663140 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Everything’s under control up here.  Are you ready?
L663093 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
L663092 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ This is the end.
L663049 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ What do you think?
L663048 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ He was a...good lover?
L663047 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Of course...
L663046 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  It’s what you wanted.
L663045 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ How would you know?
L663044 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
L662994 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ Is it?
L662993 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Warm.
L663194 +++$+++ u8972 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Still no contact yet.
L663193 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Any word from him?
L662931 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Where it can do the most damage.
L662930 +++$+++ u8972 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ It’s heading for the oil terminal.
L662929 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ The parcel’s in the post.
L662883 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Marvellous.
L662882 +++$+++ u8972 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
L662881 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Do we have the range of Renard’s plane?
L662609 +++$+++ u8972 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ And expensive.  Cost three million plus.
L662608 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ We’ve been pawns in someone’s game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.
L663447 +++$+++ u8975 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ ADAMSON +++$+++ Please.
L663446 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ What?!
L663445 +++$+++ u8975 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ ADAMSON +++$+++ The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.
L663444 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I would like to use the bathroom --
L663443 +++$+++ u8975 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ ADAMSON +++$+++ I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
L663442 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Why?  What's the problem?
L663441 +++$+++ u8975 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ ADAMSON +++$+++ Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
L663440 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
L663643 +++$+++ u8987 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
L663642 +++$+++ u8976 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ ANALYST +++$+++ We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
L663641 +++$+++ u8987 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
L663640 +++$+++ u8976 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ ANALYST +++$+++ As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
L663638 +++$+++ u8976 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ ANALYST +++$+++ Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
L663637 +++$+++ u8987 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ What kind of time frame are we talking about?
L663636 +++$+++ u8976 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ ANALYST +++$+++ Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.
L663635 +++$+++ u8987 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ What about our end?
L663303 +++$+++ u8977 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.
L663302 +++$+++ u8981 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ HYDE +++$+++ Washington?
L663301 +++$+++ u8977 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
L663300 +++$+++ u8981 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ HYDE +++$+++ Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
L663299 +++$+++ u8977 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ No idea who's behind this?
L663298 +++$+++ u8981 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ HYDE +++$+++ You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
L663297 +++$+++ u8977 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Had a lot of blood in him.
L663846 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
L663845 +++$+++ u8978 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. LONG +++$+++ That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
L663829 +++$+++ u8978 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. LONG +++$+++ We don't know that.
L663828 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ God isn't there to do it.
L663827 +++$+++ u8978 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. LONG +++$+++ Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
L663826 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
L663825 +++$+++ u8978 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. LONG +++$+++ And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
L663824 +++$+++ u8978 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. LONG +++$+++ Who is she?  Do you know her?
L663823 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ A whore fucking.
L663779 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
L663778 +++$+++ u8978 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. LONG +++$+++ There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
L663777 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Wrong answers?
L663776 +++$+++ u8978 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. LONG +++$+++ Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
L663775 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Don't call me that.
L663774 +++$+++ u8978 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. LONG +++$+++ Walter --
L664176 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
L664175 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
L663366 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
L663365 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
L663363 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
L663362 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ What's your theory?
L663361 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
L663360 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
L663357 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
L663356 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ The bearer of bad news.
L663352 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Hello, Adrian.
L663351 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Hi, Jon.
L664185 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
L664184 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?
L664183 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
L664182 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon --
L664169 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Veidt¹s complex.
L664168 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon, where are we?
L664155 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ The south pole.  Time¹s flowing backwards.
L664154 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon -- what??
L664153 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ It¹s very strange.  Time¹s flowing backwards . . .
L664141 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Cured, yes.
L664140 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ What -- am I --
L664139 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it.
L664138 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
L664137 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
L664136 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ I won't do that.
L664135 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
L664134 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ You're the only human being I care for.
L664133 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
L664132 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
L664131 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon, I do not want to hear it.
L664082 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.
L664081 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.

L664079 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
L664078 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Because --
L664077 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
L664076 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Always.  Ever since the day I died.
L664075 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
L664074 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
L664073 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ But you knew that I'd -- die.
L664072 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
L664071 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
L664070 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
L664069 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
L664067 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
L664066 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
L664065 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
L664064 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
L664062 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ You -- you know about me and Dan?
L664061 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
