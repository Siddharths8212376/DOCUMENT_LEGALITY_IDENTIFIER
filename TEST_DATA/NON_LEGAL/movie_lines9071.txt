L242177 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Do you, uh, know...
L242175 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Thanks for lying.  But you're the class officer, Wick, and it'd just be weird if we hook up.  Besides...
L242174 +++$+++ u1023 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ WICKWIRE +++$+++ I think you look beautiful.
L242173 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ I can't go out.  Not like this.
L242172 +++$+++ u1023 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ WICKWIRE +++$+++ Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
L242171 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
L242170 +++$+++ u1023 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ WICKWIRE +++$+++ That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
L242169 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Sorry, didn't mean to --
L242078 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Let's keep talkin', Wick.  Just keep talkin' to me...
L242077 +++$+++ u1023 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ WICKWIRE +++$+++ Last time I didn't.
L242076 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
L242075 +++$+++ u1023 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ WICKWIRE +++$+++ O'Neil?
L242074 +++$+++ u1023 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ WICKWIRE +++$+++ Not me.  You?
L242073 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ You got anybody, Wick?
L242072 +++$+++ u1023 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ WICKWIRE +++$+++ At first.
L242071 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ He was married?
L242070 +++$+++ u1023 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ WICKWIRE +++$+++ So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
L242069 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ That's a good story.
L242068 +++$+++ u1023 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ WICKWIRE +++$+++ Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
L242067 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ They had to kill 'em?
L242066 +++$+++ u1023 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ WICKWIRE +++$+++ One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline.  This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense.  So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone.  But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts.
L242065 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ If you got a good one, Wick...
L242064 +++$+++ u1023 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ WICKWIRE +++$+++ When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell...
L242063 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ You really came back for more?  Of this?
L242062 +++$+++ u1023 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ WICKWIRE +++$+++ Intagliata was out chasing breakfast.  They found his tracks. Well, shit.
L242061 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Wick.  They got your crew, too?
L242060 +++$+++ u1023 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ WICKWIRE +++$+++ You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
L242059 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Who is it?
L241856 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Thanks, Wick.
L241855 +++$+++ u1023 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ WICKWIRE +++$+++ Hey.  Way to gut it out.
L241751 +++$+++ u1023 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ WICKWIRE +++$+++ You're kind of a surprise yourself.
L241750 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.
L241749 +++$+++ u1023 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ WICKWIRE +++$+++ Made it to Week 10 last time.
L241748 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ And how do you know that?
L241747 +++$+++ u1023 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ WICKWIRE +++$+++ It was made clear.  Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half.
L241746 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Whose orders were those?
L241745 +++$+++ u1023 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ WICKWIRE +++$+++ It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway.
L241744 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Well, now I feel so much better.
L241743 +++$+++ u1023 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ WICKWIRE +++$+++ They're more afraid of you.
L242368 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Grab an oar, find a way to weight it down, we're gonna need it.  Cortez, help him.  Flea?  You take one of the two full minis -- and just follow my lead.
L242367 +++$+++ u1018 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ MCCOOL +++$+++ Maybe half.  Not even.
L242366 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air in yours?
L242055 +++$+++ u1018 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ MCCOOL +++$+++ Smoke it!
L242054 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ 'Cool?
L242053 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
L242052 +++$+++ u1018 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ MCCOOL +++$+++ 32 feet, six inches!
L242039 +++$+++ u1018 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ MCCOOL +++$+++ Mighta been civilian.
L242038 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area.  Now how smart is that?
L242029 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ I don't know...
L242028 +++$+++ u1018 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ MCCOOL +++$+++ She part of the training?
L241848 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ What, you gonna give it all up for a maple twist?  How dumb you gotta be? That's exactly what they --
L241847 +++$+++ u1018 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ MCCOOL +++$+++ Just askin'
L241846 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ What're you guys doing?  Huh?
L242378 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.
L242377 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ O'Neil...
L242358 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Show us where you are, Chief.
L242357 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ Got it.
L242352 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ 15, sir.
L242351 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ Say again?  How many micks?
L242350 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over.
L242349 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ Managed to activate the ELB.  If you just radio base and let them know, they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked by a reef.  Over.
L242319 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ Okay, O'Neil.  So you've impressed all the others.  Now try me.
L242318 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Good to see you again, too, sir.
L242317 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ Well, I'm trying to figure out if you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous -- or some new alloy of all three.
L242134 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ I think we oughtta practice it, just so you know what to expect.
L242133 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Sure.  Just like your men do.
L242132 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured?  Didn't you even think about that?
L242131 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ I'm so glad we agree.
L242130 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ No.
L242129 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ Do you?
L242128 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ You think we should go easy on women, O'Neil?
L242127 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.
L242126 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
L242125 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ I think you're the liar.
L242124 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
L242123 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ That's not right.
L242122 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --
L242121 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
L242120 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ Would you have shot if it was a man?
L242119 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ She led us right to you.  That's no threat?
L242118 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Wasn't deemed a threat.
L242117 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?
L242116 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ Right down to your worthless womb, and I'll tell you why.  This is my island.  My world.  And here I can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world. Take another scan of my little joy- boy outside.  If I can do that to a Navy Seal, what's gonna happen to you?  Huh?
L242115 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Should I be afraid?
L242114 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
L242113 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not going to get anywhere.  You might as well put me in the cage.
L242112 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
L242111 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Dick, Jane, and Spot.
L242110 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ Any brothers?  Sisters?
L242109 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ "Dad."
L242108 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ Simple question, lieutenant.  No reason not to answer.  What is your father's name?
L241968 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ You were commissioned one month earlier, which makes you the senior officer.  Remember.  There are no bad crews -- only bad leaders.
L241967 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
L241966 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant.
L241965 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir.  So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead.
L241964 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion.  Men fight better without women around.  And that is an historical fact.
L241963 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant?
L241962 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
L241961 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
L241960 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?
L241959 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore.
L241958 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Permission to get dressed, sir?
L241769 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ Educate her, Pyro.
L241768 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Chief, sir, I don't understand why --
L241766 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ You heard me.  Move on.
L241765 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Say again, sir?
L242343 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Shut your hole, Slutnik.
L242342 +++$+++ u1020 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ SLUTNIK +++$+++ Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.
L242333 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for?
L242332 +++$+++ u1020 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ SLUTNIK +++$+++ You don't suppose this is just part of...
L242327 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear.  Try a wrench on that thing.
L242326 +++$+++ u1020 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ SLUTNIK +++$+++ I just wonder how that happened.
L242046 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ MOVE!
L242045 +++$+++ u1020 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ SLUTNIK +++$+++ Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
L242044 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site.  Ready?
L242019 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ North?
L242018 +++$+++ u1020 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ SLUTNIK +++$+++ Clear.
L241810 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.
L241809 +++$+++ u1020 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ SLUTNIK +++$+++ WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
L241808 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ That your desk?  I'll take this one.
L241807 +++$+++ u1020 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ SLUTNIK +++$+++ Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there.
L241806 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Funny, the C.O. says I can.
L241805 +++$+++ u1020 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ SLUTNIK +++$+++ Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You can't stay in here.  You can't sleep right next to me.
L241804 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Anybody usin' these drawers here?
L241803 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Your new roommate.
L241802 +++$+++ u1020 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ SLUTNIK +++$+++ Well, who the shit you think you are?  Comin' in here like that?
L242049 +++$+++ u1020 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ SLUTNIK +++$+++ This ain't even workin' wrong!
L242048 +++$+++ u1018 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ MCCOOL +++$+++ What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
L242047 +++$+++ u1020 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ SLUTNIK +++$+++ This ain't workin' right!
L242023 +++$+++ u1020 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ SLUTNIK +++$+++ So am I.
L242022 +++$+++ u1018 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ MCCOOL +++$+++ You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.
L241774 +++$+++ u1018 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ MCCOOL +++$+++ Somebody throw a tent over this circus.
L241773 +++$+++ u1020 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ SLUTNIK +++$+++ Can't live with them, can't kill them.  What's the point?
L241695 +++$+++ u1018 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ MCCOOL +++$+++ We are so fucked.
L241694 +++$+++ u1020 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ SLUTNIK +++$+++ Darth Vader reads poetry...
L241693 +++$+++ u1018 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ MCCOOL +++$+++ We're fucked.
L242106 +++$+++ u1022 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE SPOOK +++$+++ This is what you get for brain- picking an old CIA spook.  but if I needed to control the outcome of this test case, that's how I'd do it.  A man-in-place.  Makes everything very controllable.
L242105 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ I don't...  What, someone on base?  A "mole"?
L242104 +++$+++ u1022 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE SPOOK +++$+++ Okay, so now work it from the other end.  Think about California -- and how things might be handled there.
L242103 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
L242102 +++$+++ u1022 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE SPOOK +++$+++ I take it this file is still open.
L242101 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
L242100 +++$+++ u1022 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE SPOOK +++$+++ This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
L242099 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ I don't know.  Seems...
L242098 +++$+++ u1022 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE SPOOK +++$+++ If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
L242097 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ Women.
L242096 +++$+++ u1022 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE SPOOK +++$+++ Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
L242095 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ The first female President?
L242094 +++$+++ u1022 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE SPOOK +++$+++ The White House.  If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man.
L242093 +++$+++ u1022 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE SPOOK +++$+++ Hmm.  Let's aim higher.
L242092 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
L242091 +++$+++ u1022 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE SPOOK +++$+++ Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
L242090 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ The Navy?  They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads.  What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed?
L242089 +++$+++ u1022 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE SPOOK +++$+++ Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights.
L242088 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
L242087 +++$+++ u1022 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE SPOOK +++$+++ All right.  So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way?
L242085 +++$+++ u1022 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE SPOOK +++$+++ Sorry.  Thought you knew I knew.
L242084 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ You knew about us?
L242083 +++$+++ u1022 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE SPOOK +++$+++ Thought you two were file-closed.
L242082 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ O'Neil, Jordan.
L242081 +++$+++ u1022 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE SPOOK +++$+++ Subject?
L247505 +++$+++ u1031 +++$+++ m67 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Go in there. Talk to her.
L247504 +++$+++ u1024 +++$+++ m67 +++$+++ ANIMAL +++$+++ Me!? You where the one...
L247503 +++$+++ u1031 +++$+++ m67 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
L247502 +++$+++ u1024 +++$+++ m67 +++$+++ ANIMAL +++$+++ What?
L247501 +++$+++ u1031 +++$+++ m67 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
L247500 +++$+++ u1024 +++$+++ m67 +++$+++ ANIMAL +++$+++ Where's Audrey?
L247499 +++$+++ u1031 +++$+++ m67 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
L247498 +++$+++ u1024 +++$+++ m67 +++$+++ ANIMAL +++$+++ Who the hell are all these people?
L247227 +++$+++ u1024 +++$+++ m67 +++$+++ ANIMAL +++$+++ Great. See ya then.
L247226 +++$+++ u1031 +++$+++ m67 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
