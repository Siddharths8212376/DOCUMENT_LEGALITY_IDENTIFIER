L346849 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Give me his name, I will mail him.
L346848 +++$+++ u1726 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ Huh? I see, but this is the FBI, little girl, and I can't let you in.  But if you leave me his money, I'll give him it myself.
L346847 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ He forgot his money...  My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
L346846 +++$+++ u1726 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ Why do you want to know?
L346845 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ What's that man's name?
L347015 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ ...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
L347014 +++$+++ u1727 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ ...Good...  But what's special in him?
L347013 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
L347012 +++$+++ u1727 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
L347011 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ ...What?
L347010 +++$+++ u1727 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ I can't believe it! "Yes I think"... How she kids me! I can't believe it!  And did he pass your threshold or not?
L347009 +++$+++ u1727 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Come on, shit, tell me! Is he beautiful?
L347008 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ No.
L347007 +++$+++ u1727 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?
L347006 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
L347005 +++$+++ u1727 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
L347004 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
L347003 +++$+++ u1727 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
L347002 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ No?
L347001 +++$+++ u1727 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you.  But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?
L346776 +++$+++ u1735 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Take them, you never know... If you want to have some fun. Take, it's a gift.
L346775 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Well, I don't need them...
L346774 +++$+++ u1735 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Take...
L346772 +++$+++ u1735 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ I'll explain you, Leon: they'll ask you to fill in a lot of forms and you can't write and they'll ask you your job, your employer's name and you can't tell them: My job, I'm a hitman and my employer is Tony, his record is longer than his resturant's menu.  That's why you can't have a bank account!
L346771 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Why can't I have a bank account?
L346769 +++$+++ u1735 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!
L346768 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
L346767 +++$+++ u1735 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
L346766 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ No, no.
L346764 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ No... Just to know... Because it's a long time I work... And I never did anything with my money... I should do something.
L346763 +++$+++ u1735 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Do you need money?
L346762 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Tell me... The money I earn and you keep for me...
L346761 +++$+++ u1735 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ That's what I later told myself!  No, Tony, forget Leon! It can't be him, he likes too much his job to make such a slaughter!
L346760 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
L346759 +++$+++ u1735 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
L346758 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yes.
L346757 +++$+++ u1735 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ It's better...  You see, it's my turf, so I don't want contracts I'm not informed about, on my turf.  I'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?
L346756 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ ...Not at all.
L346755 +++$+++ u1735 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
L346754 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yeah.
L346753 +++$+++ u1735 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ ...You moved too, didn't you?
L347145 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!
L347144 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ You say it just to calm me!
L347142 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ No, no! I don't want to go!  I don't want!
L347141 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Mathilda, listen!
L347140 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ No! I don't want to leave you!!
L347138 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
L347137 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ How shall we get out now, Leon?
L347135 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Good! Snipers can't be in position.
L347134 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ I don't know... Five minutes.
L347133 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?
L347132 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know?
L347121 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ I don't know... Getting far away, the two of us, for example...  And forgetting all this...
L347120 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yeah, what?
L347119 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
L347118 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Nothing, for the moment.
L347117 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ What do you do, with the money you earn?
L347116 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ ...Yes.
L347115 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ May I ask you a personal question?
L347114 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Three times, then two times.
L347113 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Yes.
L347112 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
L347101 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ ...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
L347100 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ ...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
L347098 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Then? You didn't give a shit about her father, didn't you?  You met anyway?
L347097 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ ...I had a girlfriend... A long time ago.  Before coming here, in my country. I was 14-year-old... We flirted like kids...  Her father didn't want her to meet me.  My family was not very respectable.
L347095 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!
L347094 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
L347093 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ ...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
L347092 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
L347091 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ ...I don't know.
L347090 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ How many girlfriends did you have?
L347088 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ ...Don't you like me?
L347087 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ ...No...
L347086 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I prefer waiting for a while...  I feel it would go the wrong way.
L347085 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ ...Don't you drink?
L347083 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Of course! I'm fine!  I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up...  I tried to get beautiful!  Don't you like it?
L347082 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Well... I don't know, suddenly, the make up... All this... How are you?  Are you OK?
L347072 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Well... I proposed them to play roulette...  Like we played...  ...And I lost.
L347071 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Poor darling, and then?
L347068 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I love you too, and I don't want to lose you.
L347067 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ I love you so much, Leon.
L347066 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear.
L346995 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ I don't grow up any more. I just get older.
L346994 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
L346993 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
L346992 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ No, excuse me... It's the yogurt that made me laugh.
L346990 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
L346989 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
L346988 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ There are just two things I'm interested in: love and death.  For the moment, I have none of the two!
L346987 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ ...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
L346986 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Risky business, isn't it?
L346985 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Yeah... I'm just good for left-overs!
L346984 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ It's too big.
L346981 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
L346980 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
L346979 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ A little...
L346978 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
L346977 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
L346976 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ ...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?
L346975 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yeah!... Anyway, I don't like hotels. Too much people, everyone's got the key... I don't like it.
L346974 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
L346973 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice.
L346933 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ ...Later.
L346932 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ ...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
L346931 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ There are better things.  You see the importance of the "moment".  Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it.  This way, he already departed. Without knowing.
L346930 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ It's cool departing this way... warm... music...
L346927 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ ...Why didn't he close the window?
L346926 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
L346925 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Where are you going?
L346924 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I think.
L346923 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ What shall we do?
L346922 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ ...Shit!!  We'd found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
L346918 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ ...17.
L346917 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
L346916 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Mathilda?!
L346915 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ ...OK.  I love you anyway.
L346914 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
L346913 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ When I say I love you.
L346912 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ What?
L346911 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ ...You don't believe me, don't you?
L346908 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
L346907 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Stop. Everyone is looking.
L346905 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Mathilda, stop, please!
L346904 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ ...I'm going to kiss you.
L346902 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?
L346901 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ It's true... But a first contract, it's an exception.
L346874 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ OK... And if it's you who gets killed?  ...Then?  Talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? She's here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day, your hour, your second...
L346873 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ If you knew, Leon...!  I killed one thousand in my head...  And this never disturbed my sleep.
L346870 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I never rent my gear.
L346869 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
L346868 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Too heavy.
L346867 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Why?
L346866 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Not taken.
L346857 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ ...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
L346856 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ ...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
L346814 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ I hate you because you depart without kissing me. That's all.
L346813 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ You see, five minutes ago you said you loved me and now you hate me... but I prefer this!
L346811 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ No, you can't go out.
L346810 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ For musicals?  That's part of the job!
L346809 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ No.
L346808 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ May I go to the cinema?
L346806 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you can't discuss, we said. Right?
L346805 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now.  You said I learn very quickly.
L346801 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Yes.
L346800 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Mathilda? May I come in?
L346796 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ ...Because I feel it.
L346795 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
L346794 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...
L346789 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ I killed him... and cut him and ate all of him... I left nothing for you!
L346788 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
L346787 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ You were scared, weren't you?
L346786 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Come on, get down!
L346781 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ OK.
L346780 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
L346746 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ There, the guy... How did you do that, without even touching him? Without noise. It's like you put him away... How did you do it?
L346745 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ What?
L346744 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ It's incredible! How did you do it?
L346743 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Yes, yes...
L346742 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ What's up? I don't feel you're concentrated.
L346727 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ OK.
L346726 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ The yellow and pink.
L346725 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Now, try a running guy.
L346724 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ OK.
L346723 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
L346722 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
L346721 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Good! First shot!
L346716 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Perfect.
L346715 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ The fat man down there, on the bench.
L346712 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Whoever.
L346711 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Who'll I aim at?
L346710 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yeah...  Come on, have a little training.
L346709 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Wow! It's brilliant!
L346708 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Oh really?  But can you miss the car?
L346707 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Rocket launcher.
L346706 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
L346705 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
L346704 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ What, for example?
L346703 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
L346702 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ How can you say it?
L346701 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ 130... 140...
L346700 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Huh... 500 meters?
L346699 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?
L346698 +++$+++ u1728 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Good.
L346697 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ OK, I'm fine.
L347129 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ I have no fear.
L347128 +++$+++ u1729 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Don't fear.
L346938 +++$+++ u1729 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ ...One second.
L346937 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
L346936 +++$+++ u1729 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ ...Yes?
L346893 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
L346892 +++$+++ u1729 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
L346891 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ ...I got lost, Mister.
L346890 +++$+++ u1729 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.
L346889 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
L346888 +++$+++ u1729 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Yes?
L346831 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ ...No... he's my lover...
L346830 +++$+++ u1731 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ Huh?
L346829 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
L346828 +++$+++ u1731 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ Huh, that's good!
