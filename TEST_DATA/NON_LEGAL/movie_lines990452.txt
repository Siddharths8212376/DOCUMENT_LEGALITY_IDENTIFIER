L622590 +++$+++ u8563 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Why are you talking like that?
L622589 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good.
L622587 +++$+++ u8563 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Arnie, thank God.
L622586 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ Helena, I'm so sorry --
L623260 +++$+++ u8555 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CARLOS +++$+++ Goodbye Arnie.
L623259 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ Carl --
L623258 +++$+++ u8555 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CARLOS +++$+++ Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is.
L623257 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed.  I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal.
L623256 +++$+++ u8555 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CARLOS +++$+++ So my wife is lying?
L623255 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ Carl, that's insane.
L623254 +++$+++ u8555 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CARLOS +++$+++ You had it all figured out.  You move into my house.  You raise my kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It was a good plan, Arnie.
L623253 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it.  It could have been frozen along with everything else.
L623252 +++$+++ u8555 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CARLOS +++$+++ And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
L623251 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ I was just waiting for the right time.
L623250 +++$+++ u8555 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CARLOS +++$+++ So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
L623249 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ What?
L623248 +++$+++ u8555 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CARLOS +++$+++ Don't bother.
L623247 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming right now --
L623246 +++$+++ u8555 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CARLOS +++$+++ It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too hard.
L623168 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour.
L623167 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Where are you going?
L623166 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ At least she's alive.
L623165 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ So's the video camera.
L623164 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ My Leica's gone.
L623092 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I don't know.
L623091 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?
L623090 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Me, too.
L623089 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ About the other night, I'm sorry.
L623015 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ No, not yet.
L623014 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Should we bring the police into this?
L622905 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
L622904 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Oh, it is?
L622903 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.
L622902 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.
L622901 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Yeah, well, she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar, too.
L622900 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
L622899 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Look, I'm as worried as you are --
L622898 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
L622897 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
L622896 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
L622895 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Barbara --
L622894 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.
L622892 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Does this mean you're going to be gone more?
L622891 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.
L622702 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ She asked me not to.
L622701 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me.  As a parent.
L622700 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --
L622699 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ How long have you known?
L622697 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ We don't want to push her away. These are growing experiences.
L622696 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?
L622695 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
L622694 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
L622693 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Why?
L622692 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ This is different.
L622691 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
L622690 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
L622689 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  I tried --
L622688 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.
L622687 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Me, too.
L622686 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I think she's lying.
L622572 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ It's so frustrating.
L622571 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ That's frustrating.
L622570 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise.  Superfund is just one of those words.  People stop paying attention.
L622567 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Drugs begin pouring out of America into every other country in the world. Canada is completely overwhelmed.
L622566 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Like a Grateful Dead Concert.
L622682 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ He's a friend.  He's also like the only one who was dealing with the situation.  He'd definitely had a few beers, but it's not like he wanted to drive.  We didn't know what else to do.  It wasn't my pot.
L622681 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving?  You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.
L622680 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ He didn't hang around us.  He's like one of those hippie kids.  I'm not part of that group.  It was a party in all these rooms.  His girlfriend who I barely know was completely hysterical... He's blue, he's puking... We didn't want to get in trouble, but what were we supposed to do?  I mean, what would you have done if you had been us?
L622662 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ What do you think?
L622661 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Is this bad for him?
L622660 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I don't know.
L622659 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Are you going to?
L622658 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Not yet.
L622657 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Did you tell Dad?
L622584 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Sorry, but I mean, come on.
L622583 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Caroline --
L622582 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ None of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual Drug Czar.
L622581 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia.
L622580 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Czar for life, just like a real czar.
L622574 +++$+++ u8553 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Honey, your father knows the President.
L622573 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Did you meet the President?
L622949 +++$+++ u8563 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Tell me what to do, Carl.  I need guidance, not a fucking platitude.  I'm not bringing a child into the kind of life I grew up with.  I won't do it.  I want our life back.
L622948 +++$+++ u8554 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Helena --
L622947 +++$+++ u8563 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
L622946 +++$+++ u8554 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you --
L622945 +++$+++ u8563 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents.  I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back.
L622944 +++$+++ u8554 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Helena --
L622943 +++$+++ u8563 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
L622942 +++$+++ u8554 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ How's David?
L622543 +++$+++ u8563 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.
L622542 +++$+++ u8554 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ You all right?
L622541 +++$+++ u8554 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ I got that.  How was your day?
L622540 +++$+++ u8563 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Just watching you.
L622539 +++$+++ u8554 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ What's up?
L622538 +++$+++ u8563 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Hi.
L622537 +++$+++ u8554 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Hi.
L622920 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Oh, yes I can.
L622919 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ You can't make me.
L622918 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere.
L622917 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Like I give a fuck.
L622916 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Okay, young lady, that's it.
L622913 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.
L622912 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Where is it?  Where are the drugs?  Where are they?
L622579 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ It's a presidential appointment so... until I quit or get fired.
L622578 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ How long's the job?
L622577 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I don't know.
L622576 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Will we get invited to the White House?
L622575 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".
L622569 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Somehow, I don't see that happening.
L622568 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ What if every country legalized at the same time?
L622565 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Fine -- legalization.  Okay, forgetting all of our international trade agreements, legalize everything today.  The Government inserts itself into all drug transactions.  The U.S. becomes a giant pharmacy.  Our borders are mobbed, lines of people from here to Europe wanting to smoke, snort and shoot themselves into oblivion.
L622564 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
L622563 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ What's it like?  Imagine you're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta, except the beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don't say "please" or "thank you."
L622654 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ I'm a National Merit Finalist.  I'm on the Hi-Q team and the Math team. I'm in the Spanish Club.  I'm a Thespian.  I'm Vice-President of my class.  I'm on the volleyball team.
L622653 +++$+++ u8576 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ SOCIAL WORKER +++$+++ You do?  What else you do?
L622652 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ I get A's.  All A's.
L622651 +++$+++ u8576 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ SOCIAL WORKER +++$+++ What's that mean?
L622650 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ I'm third in my class.
L622649 +++$+++ u8576 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ SOCIAL WORKER +++$+++ How are your grades?
L622648 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Yeah.
L622647 +++$+++ u8576 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ SOCIAL WORKER +++$+++ Private?
L622646 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Cincinnati Country Day.
L622645 +++$+++ u8576 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ SOCIAL WORKER +++$+++ In school?
L622644 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ I volunteer.  I read to blind people. One day a week for two hours.
L622643 +++$+++ u8576 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ SOCIAL WORKER +++$+++ Do you work?
L622642 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Yes.
L622641 +++$+++ u8576 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ SOCIAL WORKER +++$+++ Parents still together?
L622640 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Yes.
L622639 +++$+++ u8576 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ SOCIAL WORKER +++$+++ Live with your parents?
L622638 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Sixteen
L622637 +++$+++ u8576 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ SOCIAL WORKER +++$+++ ...How old are you?
L622841 +++$+++ u8573 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Why?  Nobody's there.
L622840 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ I think so.  If she didn't she should have.  I've only got maybe an hour.  Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.
L622839 +++$+++ u8573 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy?
L622821 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Then here's a little bump.
L622820 +++$+++ u8573 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Yes, mom --
L622819 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Have you done your homework, honey?
L622818 +++$+++ u8573 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
L622817 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
L622816 +++$+++ u8573 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ You know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day?  He and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to seven, set your clock, two bourbons --
L622623 +++$+++ u8573 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ He's gonna fucking die right here on the kitchen floor --
L622622 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Are you kidding...  I'm staying with you --
L622610 +++$+++ u8573 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ We live our lives by these unspoken rules that are handed to us.
L622609 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ Ach, that's what I'm talking about. Sarcasm.  Always fucking sarcasm. You're afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you're weak or won't like you --
L622416 +++$+++ u8573 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Not like.  It is.
L622415 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ What is this, like freebase?
L622414 +++$+++ u8573 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Inhale the smoke and hold it.
L622413 +++$+++ u8573 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Just watch.
L622412 +++$+++ u8556 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CAROLINE +++$+++ What are you doing?
L623056 +++$+++ u8557 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CASTRO +++$+++ Yeah, like turning into a beautiful woman.
L623055 +++$+++ u8561 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ GORDON +++$+++ Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?
L623054 +++$+++ u8557 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CASTRO +++$+++ Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months?
L622793 +++$+++ u8557 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CASTRO +++$+++ She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids.
L622792 +++$+++ u8561 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ GORDON +++$+++ What do you think she wants?
L622791 +++$+++ u8557 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CASTRO +++$+++ I don't know.
L622790 +++$+++ u8561 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ GORDON +++$+++ What do we do?
L622753 +++$+++ u8557 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CASTRO +++$+++ I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.
L622752 +++$+++ u8561 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ GORDON +++$+++ Are you getting this on tape?
L622737 +++$+++ u8557 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CASTRO +++$+++ Winners don't do coke.  Or haven't you been reading the bumper stickers?
L622736 +++$+++ u8561 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ GORDON +++$+++ He won.  He was a winner.  That bothers you.
L622735 +++$+++ u8557 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CASTRO +++$+++ Maradona is a cokehead.  Hand of God, my ass.  We're wasting our time here.
L622734 +++$+++ u8561 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ GORDON +++$+++ You should see little Montel play. Little Montel is the next Maradona.
L622674 +++$+++ u8557 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CASTRO +++$+++ You want to make a wager on this?
L622673 +++$+++ u8561 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ GORDON +++$+++ So does half of San Diego.
L622672 +++$+++ u8557 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CASTRO +++$+++ She knows Arnie Metzger.
L622671 +++$+++ u8561 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ GORDON +++$+++ I'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.
L622670 +++$+++ u8557 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CASTRO +++$+++ I have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.
L622669 +++$+++ u8561 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ GORDON +++$+++ She ain't in on it.
L622668 +++$+++ u8557 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CASTRO +++$+++ They're whispering.  I can't hear them, but I know it.  I smell conspiracy.  I feel the lie vibrating out of the home.
L622530 +++$+++ u8557 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ CASTRO +++$+++ Who do you work for?
