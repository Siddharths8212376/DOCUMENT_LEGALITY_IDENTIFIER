L65621 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ He's a great writer –
L65620 +++$+++ u3870 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GEISLER +++$+++ Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
L65619 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
L65618 +++$+++ u3870 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GEISLER +++$+++ Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
L65617 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-
L65616 +++$+++ u3870 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GEISLER +++$+++ What do you think this is? HAMLET? GONE WITH THE WIND? RUGGLES OF RED GAP? It's a goddamn B picture! Big men in tights! You know the drill!
L65615 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Well not much.
L65614 +++$+++ u3870 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GEISLER +++$+++ Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
L65613 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started–
L65612 +++$+++ u3870 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GEISLER +++$+++ On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
L65611 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Well I...
L65610 +++$+++ u3870 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GEISLER +++$+++ Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps – this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
L65609 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
L65608 +++$+++ u3870 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GEISLER +++$+++ Wuddya got for me – what the hell happened to your face?
L65423 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Who?
L65422 +++$+++ u3870 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GEISLER +++$+++ ...Look, you're confused? You need guidance? Talk to another writer.
L65421 +++$+++ u3870 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GEISLER +++$+++ Wallace Beery. Wrestling picture. What do you need, a road map?
L65420 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected –
L65419 +++$+++ u3870 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GEISLER +++$+++ Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
L65418 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ But Lipnik said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week.
L65417 +++$+++ u3870 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GEISLER +++$+++ Don't worry about it. It's just a B picture. I bring it in on budget, they'll book it without even screening it. Life is too short.
L65412 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Then who should I talk to?
L65411 +++$+++ u3870 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GEISLER +++$+++ What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
L65410 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
L65409 +++$+++ u3870 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GEISLER +++$+++ Think about it, Fink. Writers come and go; we always need Indians.
L65408 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I'm a writer. Ted O –
L65407 +++$+++ u3870 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GEISLER +++$+++ We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
L65406 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ ...Huh? No, I'm –
L65405 +++$+++ u3870 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GEISLER +++$+++ Ever act?
L65404 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the –
L65901 +++$+++ u3869 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GARLAND +++$+++ Well, you just... sound a little–
L65900 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Sound a little what?
L65899 +++$+++ u3869 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GARLAND +++$+++ Well, I'm just asking. You sound a little –
L65898 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Yes... Isn't it?
L65897 +++$+++ u3869 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GARLAND +++$+++ ...Barton, is everything okay?
L65896 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Have you read the Bible, Garland?
L65895 +++$+++ u3869 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GARLAND +++$+++ ...That's fine.
L65894 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Very important, Garland. I just thought you should know that. Whatever happens.
L65893 +++$+++ u3869 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GARLAND +++$+++ Well, I'm... glad to hear that –
L65892 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Not big in the sense of large – although it's that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done.
L65891 +++$+++ u3869 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GARLAND +++$+++ What do you mean, Barton?
L65890 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
L65889 +++$+++ u3869 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GARLAND +++$+++ Go ahead, son.
L65888 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
L65887 +++$+++ u3869 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GARLAND +++$+++ ...What is it Barton? Are you okay?
L65885 +++$+++ u3869 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GARLAND +++$+++ Okay.
L65884 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Yeah, I'm fine, Garland – I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
L65883 +++$+++ u3869 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GARLAND +++$+++ Barton? What time is it? Are you all right?
L65276 +++$+++ u3869 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GARLAND +++$+++ Take my copy. You're the toast of Broadway and you have the opportunity to redeem that for a little cash – strike that, a lot of cash.
L65275 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ No, what did it say?
L65274 +++$+++ u3869 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GARLAND +++$+++ ...Look, they love you, kid – everybody does. You see Caven's review in the Herald?
L65273 +++$+++ u3869 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GARLAND +++$+++ Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm just the ten percenter. You decide what you want and I'll make it happen. I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism – if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath.
L65272 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ ...I guess I'm sprouting off again. But I am certain of this, Garland: I'm capable of more good work. Maybe better work than I did in Choirs. It just doesn't seem to me that Los Angeles is the place to lead the life of mind.
L65270 +++$+++ u3869 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GARLAND +++$+++ I'd say you're already enjoying some.
L65269 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I don't know, Garland; my place is here right now. I feel I'm on the brink of success-
L65268 +++$+++ u3869 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GARLAND +++$+++ Yes, generally, to see pap. However, point number two: A brief tenure in Hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays.
L65267 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ To see pap.
L65266 +++$+++ u3869 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GARLAND +++$+++ Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night – if the show sells out.  Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.
L65265 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
L65264 +++$+++ u3869 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GARLAND +++$+++ What do you do far a living?
L65263 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ To do what?
L65262 +++$+++ u3869 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GARLAND +++$+++ We have to talk a little business. I've just been on the phone to Los Angeles.  Barton, Capitol Pictures wants to put you under contract. They've offered you a thousand dollars a week. I think I can get them to go as high as two.
L65260 +++$+++ u3869 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GARLAND +++$+++ Don't panic, I'll join you in a minute.  What's you think of Richard and Poppy?
L65259 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I thought you were going to join us. Jesus, Garland, you left me alone with those people.
L65959 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Because you DON'T LISTEN!
L65958 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ But Charlie – why me? Why –
L65952 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I hear it's Mundt. Madman Mundt.
L65951 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...Don't look at me like that, neighbor.  It's just me – Charlie.
L65810 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.
L65809 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ You'll be back?
L65805 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll help you finish your script. You'll think about me...
L65804 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ It's more than I've got.
L65803 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime – when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic.
L65802 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Sure, Charlie.
L65798 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Dammit, don't argue with me. You asked me to believe you – well I do. Now don't argue with me.
L65797 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Yeah, but Charlie –
L65796 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on – just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.
L65795 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ ...I just don't know what... to do–
L65794 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Charlie, I feel like I'm going crazy – like I'm losing my mind. I don't know what to do... I didn't do it, believe me. I'm sure of that, Charlie. I just...
L65793 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It's okay... It's okay...
L65791 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Charlie! I've got no one else here! You're the only person I know in Los Angeles...
L65790 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
L65789 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Jesus, Charlie, I...
L65788 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Have to, old timer. Just for a while.
L65787 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Jesus... You're leaving.
L65751 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
L65750 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ ...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
L65747 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You're in pictures, Barton. Even if you got cleared eventually, this would ruin you.
L65746 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
L65745 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Jesus... They can tell that...
L65743 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I believe you – I KNOW you. But why should the police?
L65742 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ But I didn't do it – don't you believe me?
L65741 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
L65740 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I don't know!  Maybe it was her... boyfriend. I passed out. I don't know.  Won't the police be able to –
L65739 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What do you think happened?
L65738 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Yeah.
L65737 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
L65736 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ We gotta call the police –
L65735 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
L65734 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me!
L65733 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
L65732 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I didn't do this, I did NOT do this–
L65731 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hold on –
L65730 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ You gotta believe me –
L65729 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hold on –
L65728 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I've gotta call the police – or you could call for me –
L65727 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this?  What're we gonna do?
L65723 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it-
L65722 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ ...Will you stay with me till they get here?
L65721 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Charlie, I'm in trouble – something horrible's happened – I've gotta call the police...
L65720 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Get a grip on yourself, brother. Whatever the problem is, we'll sort it out.
L65719 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
L65718 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Why don't we go to your room-
L65717 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ No... Can I come in?
L65716 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Barton. Are you all right?
L65715 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ No... no...
L65714 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Are you sure –
L65713 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
L65712 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...Can I come in?
L65605 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Course not, compadre. You'll see me again.
L65604 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
L65603 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ So they say.
L65602 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Well, I guess you pick your poison.
L65601 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
L65600 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ What do you mean?
L65599 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.
L65598 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Well...
L65597 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...I guess it seems pathetic to a guy like you.
L65596 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What a dump...
L65595 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
L65594 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...Your room does that too?
L65590 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Well hell, buddy, don't pull a long face!  This is still home for me – I keep my room, and I'll be back sooner or later...
L65589 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie. I'll miss you.
L65588 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact – New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
L65587 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ You're leaving?
L65586 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
L65585 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ And there's hope for you too, Charlie. Tomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen policies.
L65583 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Where there's life there's hope.
L65582 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...Ah, you'll lick this picture business, believe me. You've got a head on your shoulders. What is it they say? Where there's a head, there's a hope?
L65581 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'. I'm just glad I don't have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee hours.
L65580 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Yeah, but –
L65579 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Know about it? I can practically see how they're doin' it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.
L65578 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ How did you know about that?
L65577 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Those two love-birds next door drivin' you nuts?
L65576 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started – I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me – my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer.  Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
L65575 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if my problems amounted to a hill of beans. How goes the life of the mind?
L65572 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Defense against what? Insurance? Something they need? Something they should be thanking me for offering? A little peace of mind?...
L65571 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.
L65570 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...Did I say rude? People can be goddamn cruel. Especially some of their housewives. Okay, so I've got a weight problem. That's my cross to bear. I dunno...
L65568 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ A little lift, yeah...
L65567 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.
L65566 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Jesus, what a day. Felt like I couldn't've sold ice water in the Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss. But God, people can be rude. Feel like I have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my...
L65565 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Seems like nothing but, lately.
L65564 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had one of those days?
L65563 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.
L65562 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Because that would mean they gave you mine.
L65561 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Hi, Charlie.
L65560 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I hope these are your shoes.
L65509 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Well, that's all that wrestling is. Except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well, it's your first time. And you're out of your weight class.
L65508 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ It's okay, it's okay.
L65506 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Ready... wrestle!
L65505 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ ...Yeah, okay.
L65504 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...All right now, when I say "Ready... wrestle!"  you try and pin me, and I try and pin you. That's the whole game. Got it?
L65501 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Not a bit of it, compadre! Easiest thing in the world! You just get down on your knees to my left, slap your right hand here...
L65500 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ That's all right, really –
L65499 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration –
L65498 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Okay, but hell, you should know what it is. I can show you in about thirty seconds.
L65497 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself –
L65496 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Beery! You got no beef there! He's good.  Hell of an actor – though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don't get me wrong – Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.
L65495 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ ...Probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who's writing a wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.
L65494 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Yeah...
L65493 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Not at all. It's damned interesting.
L65492 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ ...This must be boring you.
L65490 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine – you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...
L65489 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton.  They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time –
L65486 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Sure, that's tough, but in a sense, we're all alone in this world aren't we Charlie?  I'm often surrounded by family and friends, but...
L65485 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...What's the expression – me myself and I.
L65484 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now...
L65483 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle.
L65482 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yeah, the ladies do ask for attention. In my experience, they pretend to give it, but it's generally a smoke- screen for demanding it back – with interest. How about family, Bart? How're you fixed in that department?
L65481 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ No... I guess it's something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...
L65480 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...Got a sweetheart?
L65479 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I myself have yet to be lassoed.
L65478 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Nope.
L65477 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Thanks, I'd invite you over to my place, but it's a goddamn mess. You married, Bart?
L65476 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ No, I guess you're stuck with the one you've got. Have a seat.
L65475 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell me?  Can't trade my head in for a new one.
L65474 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Seen a doctor?
L65473 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing.  Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious.
L65472 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really gotten started yet – what happened to your ear?
L65471 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.
L65470 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Charlie. How are you.
L65469 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Howdy, neighbor.
L65398 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ See you, Charlie.
L65397 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...And look, I'm sorry as hell about the interruption. Too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other people in the world.
L65396 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Well, I can tell you some stories –
L65395 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by just being yourself.
L65393 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Well, we've got something in common then.
L65392 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
L65391 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if – well I know I sometimes run on.
