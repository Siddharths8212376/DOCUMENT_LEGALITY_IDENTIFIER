L664796 +++$+++ u8992 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ JEFE +++$+++ Whatchu doing here?
L664891 +++$+++ u8993 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ He gets to be the hero.
L664890 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Like what?
L664889 +++$+++ u8993 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
L664888 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
L664887 +++$+++ u8993 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ What do you get if you finish?
L664886 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.
L664885 +++$+++ u8993 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ What weapons do you have?
L664884 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
L664883 +++$+++ u8993 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ "Anarchy" 99"?
L664882 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it "blood week". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.
L664879 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya, they called him the "Finger of God". Assassination and weapons.
L664878 +++$+++ u8993 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.
L664877 +++$+++ u8993 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ Naturally.
L664876 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade.
L664874 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You wanna check it out? Come here.
L664873 +++$+++ u8993 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
L664872 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
L664871 +++$+++ u8993 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ What game is that?
L665336 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
L665335 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ What are you doing?
L665334 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You can't welch on me now. We had a deal.
L665333 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself.
L665314 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
L665313 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
L665312 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
L665311 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
L665309 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.
L665308 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
L665307 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You can't talk to it?
L665306 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ He's shut out the communication circuit!
L665303 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice.
L665302 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ A piece of shrapnel hit me.
L665301 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You okay?
L665298 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Let me.
L665297 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Toadies right behind.
L665296 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Go to the water, it's that way!
L665295 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Where'd the damn truck go?!
L665289 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
L665288 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Where's he headed?
L665287 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Let's do this.
L665286 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
L665285 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Did you do your homework?
L665282 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
L665281 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Yorgi and Kirill.
L665270 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ He's a regular humanitarian. And all this time I thought he was just a tool.
L665269 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Don't you see, X? For the betterment of humanity, he's going to start World War Three.
L665230 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ What the hell are we doing? We're doing all this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven't even slept together yet.
L665229 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
L665228 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
L665227 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
L665226 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
L665225 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You don't have to do that.
L665224 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
L665223 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
L665222 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Aren't you afraid?
L665221 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ We'll have to go after them.
L665220 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ They left. To a fortress in the mountains.
L665218 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said.
L665217 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ We can't leave now. We have to do something.
L665216 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?
L665215 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
L665214 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
L665213 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
L665212 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
L665211 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
L665210 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
L665209 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Where are we going?
L665208 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.
L665207 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What are you doing with the Ivans?
L665206 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
L665205 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
L665204 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
L665203 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Are you alright?
L665179 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ You can't, it's too risky. I'm not much help anyway, remember?
L665178 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ When can I see you again?
L665177 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
L665176 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
L665175 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.
L665174 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I'm busted up for you, but Jesus, what the hell are you doing? Those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger.
L665173 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
L665172 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
L665171 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
L665170 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What's that?
L665169 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
L665168 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
L665167 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
L665166 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
L665132 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ They'll kill you, you know they will. Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now.
L665131 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse.
L665129 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down.
L665128 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ That's alright, I'll figure something out.
L665127 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
L665126 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
L665125 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
L665124 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
L665123 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L665122 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ They tell me you're an American agent.
L665116 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?
L665115 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
L665114 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
L665113 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
L665112 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
L665111 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?
L665110 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
L665109 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
L665108 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
L665107 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
L665106 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
L665105 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
L665104 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I'm from L.A.
L665103 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
L665098 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
L665097 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ What are you?
L665095 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Look at you. You're helping run things now. You're a gangster. I bet that snuck up on you. You woke up one day and you were a criminal.
L665094 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Go to hell!
L665093 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
L665092 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.
L665084 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ That makes two of us then, sweetheart, because I ain't buying your bullshit either. You're not like them, I can see it in your eyes. So you tell me, who's bullshitting who?
L665083 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
L665082 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Hey, you're good.
L665081 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
L665080 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
L665079 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck.
L665078 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
L665077 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ We hung out last night, remember?
L665076 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Who are you?
L665049 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ That right? Why's that?
L665048 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.
L665047 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Come on, don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you.
L665046 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
L665045 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I was invited. What's your story?
L665044 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
L665043 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Where are you going?
L665042 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Did you guys used to date? That's it, right? He broke your heart and you're still soft on him. That's funny, it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you.
L665041 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Mind your business.
L665040 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
L665039 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Go to hell.
L665038 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You do everything Yorgi says?
L665037 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Yorgi asked me to.
L665036 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
L664938 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ So cute. He shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife.
L664937 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
L664936 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
L664935 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
L664934 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Do you know what a wire transfer is?
L664933 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. And it's a mil two, max.
L664932 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S.
L665260 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Nice place to start, don't you think?
L665259 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ The Peace conference...
L665148 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Viktor! Stay the course.
L665147 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
L665146 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
L665145 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
L665144 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ What was that for?
L665139 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.
L665138 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ What are you doing?
L664998 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
L664997 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Nothing. He had two days.
L664994 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I thought that was in detail.
L664993 +++$+++ u8996 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SHAVERS +++$+++ Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
L664992 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You're joking, right?
L664991 +++$+++ u8996 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SHAVERS +++$+++ It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
L664990 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ From the Beastie Boys collection?
L664989 +++$+++ u8996 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SHAVERS +++$+++ Think again, that's government property. You have to sign for everything. I've got one more that wasn't on your list.
L664988 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I think I'll hang on to these.
L664984 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ That one I'm real familiar with.
L664983 +++$+++ u8996 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SHAVERS +++$+++ This is your standard dart gun.
L664982 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ They come in any other styles or colors?
L664981 +++$+++ u8996 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SHAVERS +++$+++ Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.
L664975 +++$+++ u8996 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SHAVERS +++$+++ Listen to you. Right away, sir, anything you say, sir.
L664974 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
L664973 +++$+++ u8996 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SHAVERS +++$+++ Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
L664972 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.
L664971 +++$+++ u8996 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SHAVERS +++$+++ Back off, just go away you klutz. Alright, here's the story. The items in these cases belong to me. I designed them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up.
L664967 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ That's would be me.
L664966 +++$+++ u8996 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SHAVERS +++$+++ Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.
L664722 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now.
L664721 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
L664720 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
L664719 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
L664718 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
L664717 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
L664716 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ You're serious?
L664715 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
L664714 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ What...?
L664713 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
L664712 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
L664711 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Alright, so I'll get more.
L664710 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
L664708 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I don't wanna go mersh, you know that. But hey, if this is about money...
L664707 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
L664706 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I'm having fun, what's the problem?
L664705 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
L664704 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I can see that. Why?
L664703 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ I'm through, Xander.
L664702 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...
L665201 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ They came and found me. They said they'd kill me unless I help them. Plus they offer me a lot of money. No big deal. These things happen. Dump your gun on the floor.
L665200 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Why you dogging me up?
L665199 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
