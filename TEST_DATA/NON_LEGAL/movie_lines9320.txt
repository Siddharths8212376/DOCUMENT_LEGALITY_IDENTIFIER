L436370 +++$+++ u2444 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ BILLINGS +++$+++ Well?
L436362 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name.
L436361 +++$+++ u2444 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ BILLINGS +++$+++ Am I one of that sort?
L436349 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ His journals, letters, maps, books...
L436348 +++$+++ u2444 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ BILLINGS +++$+++ I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.
L436285 +++$+++ u2444 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ BILLINGS +++$+++ Not many.  Dalton, Scott, they've got their reasons; Rev. Oliver, he believes in the cause; some of the young bucks; a few like me with nothing to lose...  What about you?  You've got a lot to lose.
L436284 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ It worked.  How many men can you raise?
L436283 +++$+++ u2444 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ BILLINGS +++$+++ Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?
L436282 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I expect to try.
L436281 +++$+++ u2444 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ BILLINGS +++$+++ You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
L436437 +++$+++ u2444 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ BILLINGS +++$+++ We've got plenty of baking powder. You went to Pembroke and got five pounds two weeks ago.
L436436 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
L436435 +++$+++ u2444 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ BILLINGS +++$+++ You got salt last week.
L436369 +++$+++ u2444 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ BILLINGS +++$+++ Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.
L436368 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ I know him well enough?
L436367 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ He's my father.
L436366 +++$+++ u2444 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ BILLINGS +++$+++ You don't know him very well, do you?
L436365 +++$+++ u2444 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ BILLINGS +++$+++ He's not making light.
L436364 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ He shouldn't make light.  That Redcoat should not have been killed.
L436771 +++$+++ u2445 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ Lovely.
L436770 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Two pounds, fourteen ounces.
L436641 +++$+++ u2445 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ Goodbye.
L436640 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Goodbye, Charlotte.
L436638 +++$+++ u2445 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ Very well, then.
L436637 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Of course, I do.
L436636 +++$+++ u2445 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ Do you?
L436635 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I know that.
L436634 +++$+++ u2445 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ I said, I'm not my sister.
L436633 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Excuse me?
L436210 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I'll leave in the morning with Gabriel.
L436209 +++$+++ u2445 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own.
L436208 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I've done nothing and for that I am ashamed.
L436207 +++$+++ u2445 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
L436206 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
L436205 +++$+++ u2445 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ You couldn't have known.
L436204 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ How did this... how did I let this happen?
L435993 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
L435992 +++$+++ u2445 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
L435980 +++$+++ u2445 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ As do you.
L435979 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ You look well, Charlotte.
L435975 +++$+++ u2445 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ Thank you.
L435974 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ They're from good stock on their mother's side.
L436139 +++$+++ u2457 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ TARLETON +++$+++ With a lace table cloth?
L436138 +++$+++ u2446 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CONTINENTAL SERGEANT +++$+++ We did.
L436137 +++$+++ u2457 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ TARLETON +++$+++ Who cared for your wounds?
L436136 +++$+++ u2446 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CONTINENTAL SERGEANT +++$+++ First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
L436135 +++$+++ u2457 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ TARLETON +++$+++ What unit?
L436134 +++$+++ u2446 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CONTINENTAL SERGEANT +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L436133 +++$+++ u2457 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ TARLETON +++$+++ You're surrendering.
L436529 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ They refused to give me their names. Their ranks are nine lieutenants, five captains, three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow.  Their posts?  We picked them up here-and-there last night.
L436528 +++$+++ u2447 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ Their names, ranks and posts?
L436526 +++$+++ u2447 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ What officers?
L436525 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
L436524 +++$+++ u2447 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
L436523 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
L436522 +++$+++ u2447 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ Sir?
L436521 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Prisoner exchange.
L436520 +++$+++ u2447 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ Very well, let us move on to...
L436519 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement.  And my men are excellent marksmen.
L436518 +++$+++ u2447 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
L436517 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I consider them linked.
L436516 +++$+++ u2447 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ That is a separate issue.
L436515 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
L436514 +++$+++ u2447 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
L436513 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
L436512 +++$+++ u2447 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
L436511 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ That one is a bit more difficult.
L436510 +++$+++ u2447 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
L436509 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
L436508 +++$+++ u2447 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ Thank you.
L436507 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I will do so as soon as possible.
L436506 +++$+++ u2447 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
L436505 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Very well, proceed, sir.
L436504 +++$+++ u2447 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ You are familiar with how these things are done.  In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status.
L436503 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Unless you would like to claim aggrieved status.
L436502 +++$+++ u2447 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
L436501 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
L436500 +++$+++ u2447 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ Oh?
L436499 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
L436498 +++$+++ u2447 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ Let us.  Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you...
L436497 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Shall we proceed?
L436494 +++$+++ u2447 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ As you wish.
L436493 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Colonel will do.
L436492 +++$+++ u2447 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
L436491 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Apology accepted.
L436490 +++$+++ u2447 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
L436489 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ My pleasure, sir.
L436488 +++$+++ u2447 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed.  Thank you for that, Colonel.
L436756 +++$+++ u2457 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ TARLETON +++$+++ Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center.
L436755 +++$+++ u2447 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ Do you see that, Colonel?
L436599 +++$+++ u2457 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ TARLETON +++$+++ I understand, sir.
L436598 +++$+++ u2447 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ Civility is a secondary virtue.  It is superseded by duty.
L436597 +++$+++ u2457 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ TARLETON +++$+++ Difficult, sir.  This is, as you pointed out, a civil war.
L436596 +++$+++ u2447 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ How can we end this madness?
L436595 +++$+++ u2457 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ TARLETON +++$+++ Probably.
L436594 +++$+++ u2447 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ And if I triumph, you triumph.
L436593 +++$+++ u2457 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ TARLETON +++$+++ Perhaps.
L436592 +++$+++ u2447 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ If I fail, you fail.
L436476 +++$+++ u2447 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ Most certainly.  Arrange it.
L436475 +++$+++ u2457 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ TARLETON +++$+++ Are you going to meet with him?
L436474 +++$+++ u2447 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.
L436407 +++$+++ u2457 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ TARLETON +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L436406 +++$+++ u2447 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels.
L436306 +++$+++ u2457 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ TARLETON +++$+++ Sir.
L436305 +++$+++ u2447 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ CORNWALLIS +++$+++ My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
L436688 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ As you did at Fort Wilderness?
L436687 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ If this war is about more than Thomas, it's about more than Anne, as well.  Stay the course.
L436685 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Yes.
L436684 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ I see, do as I say, not as I do.
L436683 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ It was a different time, son.  And you're a better man than that.
L436682 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ We took our time with them and gave every one of them worse than they had given at the fort.  It was two weeks before they were all dead, all except two.  We put the heads on a pallet and had the two we let live take it to the French at Fort Ambercon.  The eyes, fingers and tongues we put in a basket and sent that down the Asheulot to the Cherokee.  The French stayed east of the Blue Ridge after that and the Cherokee broke their treaty with the French and stayed out of the fight.  That seemed to make a difference. The war went another year, things went better... and men bought us drinks.
L436681 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Go on.
L436680 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ We buried them, then we went to track.  It was a cold trail and they were moving fast.  We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford.
L436677 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ I'm not my mother.  I can't have the respect without the knowing.
L436676 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ That's why it was four years between you and Thomas.  It took me that long to regain her respect.
L436675 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born.  I was drunk and I was foolish enough to answer her.
L436674 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ That's not enough.  Tell me.
L436673 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ That's right.
L436672 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
L436671 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ And what do they know?
L436670 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
L436669 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Everyone knows.  It's what made me a hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I got a medal.  Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes.  Everyone knows what happened.
L436668 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ No, I don't.
L436667 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ You know what happened.
L436666 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
L436665 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ She is.  Don't go in there.
L436664 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
L436663 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Don't go in there.
L436608 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Seven homes along the Black River so far...
L436607 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Where?
L436606 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on it.  A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as well.
L436584 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ I know.
L436583 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ It's beautiful there.  Your mother and I were there once, before you were born.
L436582 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Cheraw Falls.
L436581 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Granted.  Where are you going?
L436580 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?
L436576 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Come with me.  I'll tell you when we get there.
L436575 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ What?
L436574 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.
L436572 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?
L436571 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.
L436569 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I don't believe it... and I wasn't there for it...
L436568 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
L436567 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ She spoke?  Susan spoke?
L436464 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ She got me at a more impressionable age.
L436463 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ You learned her lessons better than I.
L436462 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan.
L436461 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Stay the course... your mother used to say that to me when I'd get drunk or lose my temper.
L436459 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Or perhaps tomorrow at the expense of our cause.
L436458 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ No...
L436457 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
L436456 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I should have killed him when I had the chance?
L436455 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured.
L436434 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ We're low on salt.  I should go to Pembroke and get some.
L436433 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Gabriel?  Are you asleep?
L436376 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Pride is his weakness.
L436375 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Father?
L436374 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Lord Cornwallis is brilliant.  His weakness is that he knows it.
L436347 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ And the dogs, too, I'll wager.
L436346 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ These four wagons must be his.
L436319 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ I didn't see any.
L436318 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Flanking riders?
L436317 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
L436292 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ God help us all when you're forty.
L436291 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ You know how old I am.
L436290 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ How old are you?
L436289 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
L436288 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Is it?
L436275 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Yes...  ... father.
L436274 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ And, Corporal...  ... be careful.
L436273 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L436272 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp.  I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island.
L436271 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ He tried.  It didn't take.
L436270 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Did your father teach you humility?
L436269 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Yes, sir.  My father taught me.
L436268 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Is that so?
L436267 +++$+++ u2448 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
L436266 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Oh?
