L442761 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ I got the quick-and-ugly version.
L442760 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
L442759 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ They're coming.
L442758 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Power cells.
L442631 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Look deeper.
L442630 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
L442629 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
L442628 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Heard about it. Just never seen it.
L442627 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
L442626 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ You did this? To yourself?
L442624 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Show me your eyes.
L442623 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
L442621 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.
L442620 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ What whispers?
L442619 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ 'Mean the whispers?
L442618 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before....  If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull.
L442901 +++$+++ u7059 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can....  Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
L442900 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ What, switch what?
L442899 +++$+++ u7059 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ Can we switch?
L442898 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Let's move.  Just a detour. He'll get us there.
L442846 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ We'll have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes.
L442845 +++$+++ u7059 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at night.
L442841 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light.
L442840 +++$+++ u7059 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ Possibly.
L442839 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
L442838 +++$+++ u7059 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ Not sure. Ten?
L442837 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ How many bottles?
L442836 +++$+++ u7059 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.
L442835 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ ...one cutting torch...one handlight here, two more in the cabin...I <u>think</u> two more....
L442832 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ It hurts them. Light actually hurts them....
L442831 +++$+++ u7059 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ Like the light is scalding it.
L442830 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ There....
L442819 +++$+++ u7059 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ I know what's in here!
L442818 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Christ, you don't know what's out there!
L442795 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
L442794 +++$+++ u7059 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.
L442786 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ It's starting....
L442785 +++$+++ u7059 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ What do my eyes see?
L442505 +++$+++ u7059 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ 200-year-old single-malt scotch is to "booze" as foie gras is to "duck guts."
L442504 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ This is it? Booze? <u>That's</u> what you have to drink?
L442951 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?
L442950 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ We cannot go through there....
L442948 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE!
L442947 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ -- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
L442946 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Just shut up, okay?
L442945 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ -- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
L442944 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ This does not help us, Johns.
L442939 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ No, no, you're right, Fry. What's to be afraid of? My life is a steamin' pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow. So I say mush on! Canyon's only couple hundred meters, after that we're in Skiff City! So why don't you just butch up, stuff a cork in that kid, and get --
L442938 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
L442937 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.
L442936 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.
L442935 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Hey, <u>you're</u> the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An' now you 'spect me to go back like a <u>whipped</u> dog?
L442915 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking --
L442914 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ We aren't completely stupid.
L442893 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Riddick. <u>Riddick</u>.
L442892 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ So you noticed too?
L442882 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.
L442881 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
L442880 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ We're just burnin' light here.
L442879 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?
L442862 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and <u>that's</u> why you can't come up with a better plan.
L442861 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ 79 kilos.
L442860 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ How much?
L442859 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ What the hell's it matter?
L442858 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ How much you weigh, Johns?
L442857 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?
L442856 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ For your own fear.
L442855 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Smoke screen for what?
L442854 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
L442853 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?
L442844 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ We can stick to the plan. If we get four cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock.
L442843 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Oh, lady. If you're in your right mind, I pray you go insane.
L442829 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ 'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
L442828 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
L442783 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ You coulda helped. And you didn't.
L442782 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord.  So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.
L442781 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Anything <u>else</u> we should know about you, Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play games with our lives when --
L442780 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
L442779 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ <u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
L442778 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
L442777 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
L442776 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?
L442775 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Never said you were a hype, either.
L442774 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ I never said I was.
L442773 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --
L442754 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ I won't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.
L442753 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Dancin' on razor blades here...
L442752 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta do his bid.
L442751 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ You know, he hasn't harmed any of us. Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let him go if that's what it --
L442750 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ -- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.
L442749 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
L442748 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
L442747 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.
L442746 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ That's what I said.
L442745 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal.
L442744 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.
L442743 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
L442742 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
L442741 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ He can pilot?
L442739 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ <u>Get the fucking cells over here</u>, Johns. What's the discussion?
L442738 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --
L442737 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --
L442736 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Let's wait on the power cells.
L442735 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ ...need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --
L442729 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Wha'?
L442728 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ 60 years ago.
L442727 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all --
L442712 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ So what happened? Where are they, then?
L442711 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on --
L442690 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ 25 kilos each, huh?
L442689 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ 15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.
L442688 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ How many?
L442687 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells.
L442682 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
L442681 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Little ratty-ass.
L442644 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Thanks for the tip, Johns.
L442643 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
L442642 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
L442641 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
L442640 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
L442638 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ I don't. But that ground looked none too stable, and I don't want anyone --
L442637 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Thought you didn't believe his story.
L442636 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Well, don't ask me to.
L442635 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ <u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.
L442634 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
L442633 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Let's just be sure.
L442632 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ I <u>know</u> what happened -- he went off on the guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he's trying to --
L442616 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ I assume he licked it clean.
L442615 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ So why isn't it all bloody?
L442614 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
L442613 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ He used that?
L442611 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what....
L442610 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ ...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie....
L442607 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Like my pistola.
L442606 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Like what?
L442605 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Sorry. Thought I heard something.
L442604 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Shut up.
L442603 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt --
L442572 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Thought he might be coolin' it in the boneyard -- could either double-back to the ship or slip in behind us. So I left the bottle out as bait.
L442571 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ What?
L442570 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Didn't bite.
L442568 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.
L442567 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ So now you know.
L442566 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.
L442565 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
L442564 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
L442563 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
L442562 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?
L442561 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Better keep moving....
L442560 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ So I noticed. Never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship.
L442559 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ No, no, I wanted to get away.
L442557 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Probably right.
L442556 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
L442543 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Tell me it's not a mirage.
L442542 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ What?
L442533 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Which means he went toward sunrise.
L442532 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
L442531 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ A very good sign.  That's Riddick's direction. You do <u>not</u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.
L442501 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.
L442500 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ S'matter?
L442495 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Only around humans.
L442494 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
L442493 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
L442492 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ We just keep him locked up forever?
L442491 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Big Evil?
L442490 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ And him?
L442464 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
L442463 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Amazing. I'm Johns.
L442462 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Hey, me. Over here.
L442461 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Hey, who?
L442460 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Hey.
L442523 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a favor, huh? Get my crewies buried? They were good guys who died bad.
L442522 +++$+++ u7062 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ What, you're goin' off, too?
L442521 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.
L442498 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
L442497 +++$+++ u7062 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ Well? Is it just the pump?
L442483 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know.
L442482 +++$+++ u7062 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
L442481 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not enough oxygen. Might take a few days to --
L442456 +++$+++ u7058 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ OWENS +++$+++ 70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
L442455 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Owens!
L442452 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ And there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! <u>That's</u> how they train you! On a fucking simulator!
L442451 +++$+++ u7058 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ OWENS +++$+++ When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
L442450 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Company's not here, is it?
L442449 +++$+++ u7058 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ OWENS +++$+++ Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible for every one of those --
L442447 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ So what, we should both go down too? Out of sheer fucking nobility?
L442446 +++$+++ u7058 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ OWENS +++$+++ You mean that "load" of passengers?
L442445 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
L442444 +++$+++ u7058 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ OWENS +++$+++ Fry?
L442438 +++$+++ u7058 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ OWENS +++$+++ Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
L442437 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ 1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.
L442435 +++$+++ u7058 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ OWENS +++$+++ Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. <u>I'm Owens</u>. Right?
L442434 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
L442433 +++$+++ u7058 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ OWENS +++$+++ I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?
L442432 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
L442431 +++$+++ u7058 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ OWENS +++$+++ Why did I fall on you?
L443035 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ Rain.
L443034 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Oh, no. No, no, no....
L443006 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ And what about the cells?
L443005 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ The sled as a shield....
