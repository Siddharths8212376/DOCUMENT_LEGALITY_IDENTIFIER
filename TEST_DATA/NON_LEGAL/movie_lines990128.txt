L388271 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Sean, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about... Isn't going to be easy for me to say.
L388264 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Well, that's good, isn't?
L388263 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ You picked another winner!
L388228 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ What else?
L388227 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ To win?
L388220 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Yeah.  Naturally vain -- but they're about to close the betting table and I haven't a sou..
L388219 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ See anything you like?
L388182 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ Say no more.  I'm off to grab a drink. Still favor Bellinis?
L388181 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ 'Thief in the Night?'
L388180 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ What made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing.
L388179 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ I suppose I did.
L388178 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ You won.
L388158 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Maybe that's it, then.  Everything's upside down and backwards...
L388157 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here.
L388156 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Only because..it's spring..chalk it up  - to spring fever.
L388155 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ I said you're beautiful, Nyah.
L388147 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ Oh, I am.  Later..
L388146 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ You're not interested in seeing how it looks.
L388143 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ And my room?
L388142 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ Mmmm.
L388141 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Your room.
L388125 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Ahh..
L388124 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ Magic...
L388123 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ How do you that.
L388122 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ How I usually find you, Nyah.
L388121 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
L388120 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ On what.
L388119 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Well that depends.
L388118 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ How grateful?
L388117 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ I left in a bit of a hurry.  I'm terribly grateful, Sean.
L388116 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ Not much luggage.
L388510 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ Sit down.  You'll be a billionaire.  Better than being broke.  I've got terrorists and other pharmaceutical companies standing in line.  Ball's in your court, Mr. McCloy.
L388509 +++$+++ u6624 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ MCCLOY +++$+++ Outrageous.  I won't let you take control of my company.
L388505 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ In downtown Sydney for a start.
L388504 +++$+++ u6624 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ MCCLOY +++$+++ Where?
L388503 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ An outbreak of <i>Chimera.</i>
L388502 +++$+++ u6624 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ MCCLOY +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L388501 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ Good.  Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof.
L388500 +++$+++ u6624 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ MCCLOY +++$+++ Bellerophen?  No time at all once I've got it.
L388433 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ In other words, you're calling her a flake.
L388432 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions..
L388429 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ She wouldn't  be here if it wasn't for you, Hunt.  from this moment you're responsible for what happens to her, and if you're looking out for her well-being, I suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me.  Ball's in your court, Hunt.  What've you got to say? Nyah's waiting for your answer.
L388428 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ She doesn't belong here, Sean.  Let her go.
L388427 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ Somebody's been slipping you our mail. Come on out here, you bad girl.
L388426 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
L388425 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ Why, you going to make me a better offer?
L388424 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ What was the top bid?
L388423 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.
L388422 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ There it is, guys, the last of it.
L388420 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Oh.  then you knew the only way could smuggle the live virus to the CDC scientists in Atlanta was by injecting himself and using his own bloodstream as a Petri dish, doing it inside of twenty hours so he could take the anti-virus and still have it be effective.  You knew that while you were knocking him off and destroying the very thing you came for.
L388419 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ I knew where it was.
L388418 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
L388417 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
L388416 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
L388415 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ And you're happy about that?
L388414 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Fight a bit of a cold..
L388351 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Not going in from the ground.  Show me the atrium.
L388350 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ If you look at Hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security.
L388222 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
L388221 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ Nyah!
L388508 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ Which means, Mr. McCloy, we have to get our hands on four hundred and eighty thousand options.  We'll borrow your thirty million to buy those options.  Your stock's never sold above thirty-one dollars a share.  We'll agree to buy at fifty.
L388507 +++$+++ u6629 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ WALLIS +++$+++ Ninety-three point four million.
L388506 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ -- now here's the way it's going to work..Wallis, the shares outstanding are..
L388490 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ In any case we don't want your cash.
L388489 +++$+++ u6629 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ WALLIS +++$+++ More like two-two point two million.
L388488 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ Not exactly.  Wallis?
L387883 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ It's that time.  Go.
L387882 +++$+++ u6629 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ WALLIS +++$+++ Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus two-zero-thousand.  Airspeed one-seven- niner knots..
L388477 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Unless we dose her with Bellerophon on the next ninety-seven minutes, Nyah will kill herself.  So, first things, first. Swanbeck said there's no cash movement from any monitored terrorist accounts.
L388476 +++$+++ u6620 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L388475 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Wrong.  All we've got to worry about is Ambrose.  Nyah will take care of Nyah.
L388201 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I'll be damned.  It's McCloy, the Biocyte CEO.
L388200 +++$+++ u6620 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar. Big bloke, ginger hair. They're into something.
L388137 +++$+++ u6620 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Oh well, if that's how you feel about it.
L388136 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
L388135 +++$+++ u6620 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Well do you disagree with that?
L388133 +++$+++ u6620 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ - or hard wired, right.  First line of perimeter defence'll run from the back of the dock to the front of the house. Whatever moves burps or bleep is gonna be picked up to a height of twenty feet. Basically impenetrable, I'd say.
L388132 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ ..or hard wired..
L388131 +++$+++ u6620 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
L388130 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
L388129 +++$+++ u6620 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ What you got there, mate?
L388109 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ It's okay.  She scrambled the transmission.  Luther, continue feeding the GPS her position.
L388108 +++$+++ u6620 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Damn.  Just when it was about to get interesting.
L388585 +++$+++ u6620 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Right.  Just remember, mates.  Billy Baird's the name.  Anything you need to get, move or watch, I'm your man.
L388584 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ And the check's in the mall.
L388583 +++$+++ u6620 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ That's it?  That's it? That's it?
L388554 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
L388553 +++$+++ u6620 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ There she is.  I got visual.
L388552 +++$+++ u6620 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I hope there's a place to land.
L388551 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Range is two kay.
L388523 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Not for seven more minutes.
L388522 +++$+++ u6620 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ We're due to take off.
L388474 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Right.
L388473 +++$+++ u6620 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Before we kill her or cure her..
L388381 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ ..in the building...
L388380 +++$+++ u6620 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Exactly where is she?
L388379 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Billy.  I think we got a problem.  Nyah's on the wing.  Up early.  Billy, do you copy?
L388360 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ I'm not ready!
L388359 +++$+++ u6620 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Package away in five..four..three.. two..one...
L388328 +++$+++ u6620 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?
L388327 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.
L388288 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ What manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  Why would he do it?
L388287 +++$+++ u6620 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane.
L388114 +++$+++ u6620 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Then we got'em!
L388113 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ It is, Billy.
L388405 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.
L388404 +++$+++ u6621 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ BILLY'S VOICE +++$+++ What can we do' mate?
L388403 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
L388402 +++$+++ u6621 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ BILLY'S VOICE +++$+++ How're we doin', then?
L388395 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Five and a half minutes.  He's breached the hot zone..
L388394 +++$+++ u6621 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ BILLY'S VOICE +++$+++ How much longer before you can reach him?
L388393 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
L388383 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ I am. She is.
L388382 +++$+++ u6621 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ BILLY'S VOICE +++$+++ Say again. Sounds like you're saying 'she's in the building.'
L388247 +++$+++ u6621 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ BILLY'S VOICE +++$+++ He's heading down the stairs, now..
L388246 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ I'm booted up.  Go, Ethan.
L388590 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ No...
L388589 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ No.  You just looked as if you did.
L388588 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ No.  Should I?
L388445 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ I'm infected with Chimera.  You know you don't have a choice.  Just do it now.
L388444 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ No.
L388443 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
L388442 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ No.
L388441 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
L388440 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ - you who don't have a conscience.
L388439 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.
L388438 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ What did you think you were doing!
L388326 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ No time to explain.  You've done well, and we're so close.  So close.  It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!
L388325 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
L388324 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
L388323 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
L388308 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ It's going to be okay.
L388307 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
L388306 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Are you okay?
L388305 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Oh Ethan!..
L388304 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Easy, easy, easy, shhh!
L388259 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ He's touched your heart.  You're overwhelmed.  You need to think it over. You'll meet him somewhere in a month.  If You're not out in 48 hours I'm coming in and getting you out.  Give me the ear piece.
L388258 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ How do you suggest I go about it?
L388257 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I want you out of Australia!  ..I don't know how much more plainly I can put it.
L388255 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Ethan, tell me -
L388254 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Nyah, you've done more than enough.  Even the best of snake charmers get bit.
L388252 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
L388251 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I want <i>you out of there.</i>
L388239 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You noticed.  What're you going to do? Spank me?
L388238 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ I managed.
L388218 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ I'll muddle through.
L388217 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
L388216 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Where do I meet you?
L388215 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Affirmative.
L388214 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ -- his left jacket pocket.
L388205 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --
L388204 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?
L388199 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I've no doubt.
L388198 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
L388197 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Have you met them?
L388196 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ - Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
L388195 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ We know him.  He's over your left shoulder, looking right at you as you go on..
L388192 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Just about..
L388191 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Just like old times?
L388190 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Just like old times.
L388189 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ How's it going?  Everything okay?
L388099 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Well, forewarned is forearmed.  And while we're at it, be especially sensitive to any sudden change in Ambrose's plans, especially any involving you..
L388098 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice.
L388097 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you.
L388096 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Yes?
L388095 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.
L388094 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
L388093 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You don't trust me.
L388092 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
L388091 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Before you are.
L388083 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest.
L388082 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
L388081 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.
L388080 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there.
L388076 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Probably that I needed him in some urgent way..destitute - in serious trouble..the kind I couldn't possible sort out myself..
L388075 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ What wouldn't make him suspicious?
L388074 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message.  Not after the way we broke up.
L388073 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Then feel better!..
L388072 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Much.
L388071 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this?
L388070 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Not me.  I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.
L388069 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Can you think of a better one?
L388068 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ And that's the only reason?
L388067 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
L388066 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
L388065 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I don't.
L388064 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?
L388063 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You can be a thief and have a conscience.
L388062 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
L388061 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Something like that.
L388060 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
L388059 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
L388058 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ I'd like a little more conviction..
L388057 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
L388056 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ But it is what you'd like me to do. so tell me to do it..
L388055 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
L388054 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.'
L388052 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Sean Ambrose, for one.
L388051 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
L388050 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ And six billion in the world.
