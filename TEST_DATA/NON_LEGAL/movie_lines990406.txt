L585945 +++$+++ u8242 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Who's this?

L585942 +++$+++ u8242 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ The Torah says not to light a fire on the Sabbath, because it's work, correct?  But if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire?
L585941 +++$+++ u8242 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Do I give a shit?
L585940 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ It's Friday....
L586542 +++$+++ u8251 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MRS. MOEBIUS +++$+++ Danny, please, we don't want to know.
L586541 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Do you think I...
L586532 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I was just trying to make a point. If --
L586531 +++$+++ u8251 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MRS. MOEBIUS +++$+++ Are you out of your mind?!
L586517 +++$+++ u8251 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MRS. MOEBIUS +++$+++ Danny, please. Just give your speech.... And nothing about Jews, okay?
L586516 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
L586515 +++$+++ u8251 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MRS. MOEBIUS +++$+++ What?
L586514 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ We tested the new bomb.
L586338 +++$+++ u8251 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MRS. MOEBIUS +++$+++ I don't care what they are. I know those people, and I don't like them. The rest are just a bunch of kikes, aren't they?
L586337 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ They're not that Jewish.
L586336 +++$+++ u8251 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MRS. MOEBIUS +++$+++ So what?
L586335 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
L586334 +++$+++ u8251 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MRS. MOEBIUS +++$+++ Do you have a suit?  Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too.  And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you?
L586332 +++$+++ u8251 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MRS. MOEBIUS +++$+++ Look, if you want to kill Jews on your free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for us?
L586331 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I'm not an intellectual.... I mean, I read, but... Fund-raising isn't what I...
L586325 +++$+++ u8251 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MRS. MOEBIUS +++$+++ We think you'd be good at it.
L586324 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Fund-raising??
L586323 +++$+++ u8251 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MRS. MOEBIUS +++$+++ We want you to help run it. Give speeches, lead seminars... Handle the fund-raising.
L586282 +++$+++ u8252 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ RABBI +++$+++ As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a mystical number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen attributes...

L586649 +++$+++ u8254 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ REPORTER +++$+++ And so, on this, the most solemn day of the Jewish year, a former yeshiva student is being sought in connection with a monstrous hate crime that --
L586648 +++$+++ u8251 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MRS. MOEBIUS +++$+++ Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
L586647 +++$+++ u8254 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ REPORTER +++$+++ The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
L586646 +++$+++ u8251 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MRS. MOEBIUS +++$+++ Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
L586645 +++$+++ u8254 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ REPORTER +++$+++ In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?
L586644 +++$+++ u8251 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MRS. MOEBIUS +++$+++ I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
L586643 +++$+++ u8254 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ REPORTER +++$+++ What do you mean?
L586642 +++$+++ u8251 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MRS. MOEBIUS +++$+++ None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
L586641 +++$+++ u8254 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ REPORTER +++$+++ ...You're saying that when he first appeared at your house, you had no idea he was Jewish....
L587454 +++$+++ u8257 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ BONITA +++$+++ ... You take care of yourself, Johana.
L587453 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
L587452 +++$+++ u8257 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ BONITA +++$+++ Did you tell him?
L587451 +++$+++ u8257 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ BONITA +++$+++ I don't have the strength to fight off la Mamma... Anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier.
L587450 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
L587448 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Of course.
L587447 +++$+++ u8257 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ BONITA +++$+++ Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
L587446 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ You're leaving?
L587415 +++$+++ u8257 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ BONITA +++$+++ Very much, I think.  But, there's going to be a problem.
L587414 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ And you...?  Do you love Enzo?
L587413 +++$+++ u8257 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ BONITA +++$+++ Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
L587412 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
L587411 +++$+++ u8257 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ BONITA +++$+++ But your man isn't quite a God!
L587410 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
L587409 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ I can't... I just don't know how to...
L587408 +++$+++ u8257 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ BONITA +++$+++ Maybe you should talk to him about it.
L587407 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ No.
L587406 +++$+++ u8257 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ BONITA +++$+++ Does he know?
L587405 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Yes.
L587404 +++$+++ u8257 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ BONITA +++$+++ Are you going to keep it?
L587403 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ ... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
L587402 +++$+++ u8257 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ BONITA +++$+++ I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
L587401 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Yes.  Not like Enzo.
L587400 +++$+++ u8257 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ BONITA +++$+++ He's shy, not like Enzo.
L587399 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ ... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
L587398 +++$+++ u8257 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ BONITA +++$+++ You're going to live here permanently?
L587318 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
L587317 +++$+++ u8258 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ He seems to have won it.
L587316 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
L587315 +++$+++ u8258 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ The Italian, I presume?
L587314 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
L587313 +++$+++ u8258 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ You're right.  You're fired.
L587312 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?
L587311 +++$+++ u8258 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.
L587310 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
L587309 +++$+++ u8258 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Good afternoon.
L586922 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Italian is practically the same thing.
L586921 +++$+++ u8258 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
L586920 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ I tried him, he can't go.  His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.
L586919 +++$+++ u8258 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...
L586918 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
L586917 +++$+++ u8258 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ It can't be true!
L586916 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!
L586915 +++$+++ u8258 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ No!
L586914 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ The documents are forged.
L586913 +++$+++ u8258 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ What's happened??
L586912 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ The mafia!  La Cosa Nostra!
L586911 +++$+++ u8258 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ What d'you mean?
L586910 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily!
L586900 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ ... So am I.
L586899 +++$+++ u8258 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
L586898 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
L586897 +++$+++ u8258 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Did the driver really freeze?
L586895 +++$+++ u8258 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ I said that the file is incomplete.
L586894 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
L586893 +++$+++ u8258 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Johana, am I boring you?
L586892 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ What kind?
L586891 +++$+++ u8258 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ This is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete.  Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.
L587514 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
L587513 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Is he alright?  What happened?
L587512 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ That idiot!
L587511 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Five minutes and fifty seconds.
L587510 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  And he's only waiting for one thing:  that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
L587509 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Why?
L587508 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Don't.
L587507 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ ... Not yet.
L587506 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?
L587505 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ How do you know that?
L587504 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
L587503 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ He can learn.  He is learning.
L587502 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
L587501 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
L587500 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ I dive in search of God.  If I go deep enough I'm going to find him.
L587499 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ I won't, I swear.
L587498 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Because you'd laugh.
L587497 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
L587496 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ You risk your life when you cross the street.
L587495 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ You know what I'm talking about.
L587494 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ What else is there?
L587493 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Enzo, why do you guys do this?
L587492 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Checking out the competition.
L587491 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L587490 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk.
L587386 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Enzo!
L587385 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Jacques!  Johana!
L587224 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare".  You see I was right in getting you out here.  You're a world champion, my friend!
L587223 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Is it a poem?
L587185 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques.
L587184 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Yes, the Mamma is is there.
L587183 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ The Mamma's there too.
L587182 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful!  Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite.
L587181 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ ... It's a comfortable place.
L587180 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Yes...
L587179 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
L587178 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Well, good night, then...
L587172 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Enzo, stop bitching, will you?
L587171 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ And the lights!  Running lights, stealing stretchers...!  You'll have us in jail.
L587160 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Don't you agree, Jacques?
L587159 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Congratulations, Enzo.
L587158 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ ... It's easy.  You go down.  You come up.  ... Right, Johana?
L587137 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Okay.
L587136 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves.  8 o'clock in my suite?
L587078 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Listen to her!  "That's what he's here for"!  He's here to loose, that's what he's here for.  First of all, I'm unbeatable.  Second, how old are you?
L587077 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ ... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
L587076 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm going to beat you".
L587075 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ No.
L587074 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Huh?  Well listen to him!  Do you hear that?
L587056 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Italy!
L587055 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ And just where are you from?
L587053 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Exactly!  What is it Johana?  You're so crazy about him, you don't see the truth?!
L587052 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
L587051 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
L587050 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ What was he like, when he was little?
L587049 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
L587048 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Have you known him long?
L587047 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk.
L587045 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ You'll be lovely, but no thanks.  Jacques, would you do a native dance for me?
L587044 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
L587043 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ You forgot the Hula!
L587042 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ I'll take you there.  We'll live in the sun.  You'll cook fresh fish and we'll make love under the coconut trees.
L587041 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ No.
L587040 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ A new world record!  That's great! It gives me something to beat tomorrow!  You ever been to Tahiti?
L586993 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Some people say it's the most virile sport in the world.  One has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea, all muscles contracted in one super human effort...
L586992 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Congratulations.
L586991 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
L586990 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ In a lake.
L586989 +++$+++ u8259 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ ENZO +++$+++ Where did you two meet?
