L133413 +++$+++ u4509 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ MRS. KANE +++$+++ That's what you think, is it, Jim?
L133412 +++$+++ u4506 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE SR. +++$+++ Sorry, Mr. Thatcher!  What the kid needs is a good thrashing!
L133405 +++$+++ u4509 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ MRS. KANE +++$+++ You won't be lonely, Charles...
L133404 +++$+++ u4506 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE SR. +++$+++ You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  You're going to be rich.  Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -
L133396 +++$+++ u4506 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE SR. +++$+++ That's the train with all the lights.
L133395 +++$+++ u4509 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ MRS. KANE +++$+++ Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten.
L133377 +++$+++ u4509 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ MRS. KANE +++$+++ It is.  Go on, Mr. Thatcher -
L133376 +++$+++ u4506 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE SR. +++$+++ Well, let's hope it's all for the best.
L133363 +++$+++ u4506 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE SR. +++$+++ If I want to, I can go to court. A father has a right to -
L133362 +++$+++ u4509 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ MRS. KANE +++$+++ It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher -
L133361 +++$+++ u4506 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE SR. +++$+++ You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
L133360 +++$+++ u4509 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ MRS. KANE +++$+++ I'll sign those papers -
L134006 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Hey, Nurse!
L134005 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad to.
L134004 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
L134003 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Sure.
L134002 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
L134001 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ That must have been love.
L134000 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -
L133999 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Yes.
L133998 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills.  Hey, nurse!  Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South -  - you know.  Shangri-la?  El Dorado?  Sloppy Joe's?  What's the name of that place?  You know...  All right. Xanadu.  I knew what it was all the time.  You caught on, didn't you?
L133743 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ He married for love -  That's why he did everything.  That's why he went into politics.  It seems we weren't enough.  He wanted all the voters to love him, too.  All he really wanted out of life was love. That's Charlie's story - it's the story of how he lost it.  You see, he just didn't have any to give.  He loved Charlie Kane, of course, very dearly - and his mother, I guess he always loved her.  As for Emily - well, all I can tell you is Emily's story as she told it to me, which probably isn't fair - there's supposed to be two sides to every story - and I guess there are.  I guess there's more than two sides -
L133742 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Was he in love?
L133741 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Brief marriage!  Ten years! 
L133740 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ I am in receipt of your favor of yesterday.  I beg you to do me the courtesy of accepting my assurance that Mrs. Whitehall cannot be induced to contribute any more information on the career of Charles Foster Kane. She has authorized me to state on previous occasions that she regards their brief marriage as a distateful episode in her life that she prefers to forget.  With assurances of the highest esteem -
L133739 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
L133738 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
L133737 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Rawlston is my boss.
L133736 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 
L133735 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ It's a letter from her lawyers.
L133734 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ What's this?
L133677 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ I can remember everything.  That's my curse, young man.  It's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race.  Memory -  I was his oldest friend.  As far as I was concerned, he behaved like swine.  Maybe I wasnt' his friend.  If I wasn't, he never had one.  Maybe I was what nowadays you call a stooge -
L133676 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Maybe you could remember something that -
L133675 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
L133674 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Sorry, Mr. Leland.
L133673 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?  I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  I changed the subject, didn't I?  Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable old man I've become.  You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane?  Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself.  He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away.  He just - left you a tip.  He had a generous mind.  I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life.  I guess he died without one -  That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something.  You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
L133672 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Mr. Leland, you were -
L133391 +++$+++ u4516 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THATCHER +++$+++ How do you do, Charles?
L133390 +++$+++ u4509 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ MRS. KANE +++$+++ This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
L133389 +++$+++ u4516 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THATCHER +++$+++ Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
L133372 +++$+++ u4516 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THATCHER +++$+++ Right here, Mrs. Kane.
L133371 +++$+++ u4509 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ MRS. KANE +++$+++ Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
L133370 +++$+++ u4516 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THATCHER +++$+++ We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.
L133369 +++$+++ u4509 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ MRS. KANE +++$+++ I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
L133367 +++$+++ u4516 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THATCHER +++$+++ The Bank's decision in all matters concerning his education, his place of residence and similar subjects will be final. 
L133366 +++$+++ u4509 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ MRS. KANE +++$+++ I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
L134269 +++$+++ u4510 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ PHOTOGRAPHER +++$+++ Kane's last words, aren't they, Jerry?  That was Jerry's angle, wasn't it, Jerry? Did you ever find out what it means, Jerry?
L134268 +++$+++ u4519 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN +++$+++ Turn that thing off, will you?  It's driving me nuts!  What's Rosebud?
L134267 +++$+++ u4510 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ PHOTOGRAPHER +++$+++ Or Rosebud?  How about it, Jerry?
L134265 +++$+++ u4519 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN +++$+++ I wonder -  You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell?
L134264 +++$+++ u4510 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ PHOTOGRAPHER +++$+++ Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.
L134257 +++$+++ u4510 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ PHOTOGRAPHER +++$+++ I wonder how they put all those pieces together?
L134256 +++$+++ u4519 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN +++$+++ There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
L134255 +++$+++ u4510 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ PHOTOGRAPHER +++$+++ Yeah, all in crates.
L133322 +++$+++ u4511 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ RAWLSTON +++$+++ Good!
L133321 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston.
L133320 +++$+++ u4511 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ RAWLSTON +++$+++ Nothing is ever better than finding out what makes people tick.  Go after the people that knew Kane well.  That manager of his - the little guy, Bernstein, those two wives, all the people who knew him, had worked for him, who loved him, who hated his guts -  I don't mean go through the City Directory, of course -
L133319 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
L133318 +++$+++ u4511 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ RAWLSTON +++$+++ Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...
L133317 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L133316 +++$+++ u4511 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ RAWLSTON +++$+++ Thompson!
L133302 +++$+++ u4511 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ RAWLSTON +++$+++ All we saw on that screen was a big American -
L133301 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ I know, but -
L133300 +++$+++ u4511 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ RAWLSTON +++$+++ Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
L133299 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Yes, and maybe he didn't.
L134246 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear all right.
L134245 +++$+++ u4512 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ The banks are out of luck, eh?
L134244 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Millions - if anybody wants it.
L134243 +++$+++ u4512 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?
L134237 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ We're leaving tonight.  As soon as they're through photographing the stuff -
L134236 +++$+++ u4512 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ You can go on asking questions if you want to.
L134235 +++$+++ u4512 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ See what I mean?  He was a little gone in the head - the last couple of years, anyway - but I knew how to handle him.  That "Rosebud" - that don't mean anything.  I heard him say it. He just said "Rosebud" and then he dropped that glass ball and it broke on the floor.  He didn't say anything about that, so I knew he was dead - He said all kind of things I couldn't make out.  But I knew how to take care of him.
L134234 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Well, thanks a lot.
L134233 +++$+++ u4512 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Yes and no.
L134232 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
L134231 +++$+++ u4512 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ That's the whole works, right up to date.
L134201 +++$+++ u4512 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Yeah.  I guess he wasn't very happy those last years - he didn't have much reason to be -
L134200 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Queer?
L134199 +++$+++ u4512 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man.  He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him.
L134197 +++$+++ u4515 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I know.  If you're smart, you'll talk to Raymond.  That's the butler. You can learn a lot from him.  He knows where the bodies are buried.
L134196 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -
L134195 +++$+++ u4515 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
L134194 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
L134193 +++$+++ u4515 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
L134192 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
L134191 +++$+++ u4515 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -
L134096 +++$+++ u4515 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ He wanted me to be comfortable - Oh, why should I bother?  You don't believe me, but it's true.  It just happens to be true.  He was really interested in my voice.  What are you smiling for?  What do you think he built that opera house for?  I didn't want it.  I didn't want to sing.  It was his idea - everything was his idea - except my leaving him.
L134095 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ What about that apartment?
L134094 +++$+++ u4515 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ He was in love with me.  But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.
L134093 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ He married you, didn't he?
L134092 +++$+++ u4515 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I didn't get a thing.  Just the music lessons.  That's all there was to it.
L134091 +++$+++ u4515 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ What do you mean?
L134090 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ What did you get?
L134089 +++$+++ u4515 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I did a lot of singing after that. I sang for Charlie -  I sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that, I didn't -
L134016 +++$+++ u4515 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I had a toothache.
L134015 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ How did you meet him?
L134014 +++$+++ u4515 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You wouldn't want to hear a lot of what comes into my mind about myself and Mr. Charlie Kane.
L134013 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ I'd rather you just talked.  Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.
L134012 +++$+++ u4515 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions?
L133334 +++$+++ u4515 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Get out of here!  Get out!  Get out!
L133333 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ If you'd just let me talk to you for a little while, Miss Alexander. All I want to ask you...
L133332 +++$+++ u4515 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Why don't you people let me alone? I'm minding my own business.  You mind yours.
L133331 +++$+++ u4515 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Think again!
L133330 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
L133329 +++$+++ u4515 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Who told you you could sit down here?
L133344 +++$+++ u4517 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THE CAPTAIN +++$+++ Rosebud?
L133343 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
L133342 +++$+++ u4517 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THE CAPTAIN +++$+++ She'll snap out of it.  Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  Sooner.
L133341 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ She's plastered, isn't she?
L133337 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ I'm not from a newspaper exactly, I -
L133336 +++$+++ u4517 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THE CAPTAIN +++$+++ She's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.
L133328 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ I'll have a highball.
L133327 +++$+++ u4517 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THE CAPTAIN +++$+++ Right away.  Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?
L134331 +++$+++ u4521 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ ACTIVIST +++$+++ This? How long have you been smoking?
L134330 +++$+++ u4524 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CUSTOMER +++$+++ Pack of cigarettes.  What's that?
L134323 +++$+++ u4524 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CUSTOMER +++$+++ I'll just take the gum.
L134322 +++$+++ u4521 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ ACTIVIST +++$+++ It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
L134321 +++$+++ u4524 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CUSTOMER +++$+++ Jesus!
L134320 +++$+++ u4521 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ ACTIVIST +++$+++ It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.
L134319 +++$+++ u4524 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CUSTOMER +++$+++ It's not the same.
L134318 +++$+++ u4521 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ ACTIVIST +++$+++ It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
L134317 +++$+++ u4524 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CUSTOMER +++$+++ Well, if it's already too late...
L134314 +++$+++ u4521 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ ACTIVIST +++$+++ He smoked until the day he died. Used to put the cigarette in this thing and smoke it that way.
L134313 +++$+++ u4524 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CUSTOMER +++$+++ Unnhh!
L134312 +++$+++ u4521 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ ACTIVIST +++$+++ It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
L134311 +++$+++ u4524 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CUSTOMER +++$+++ What's this?
L134310 +++$+++ u4521 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ ACTIVIST +++$+++ You think I'm shitting you...
L134309 +++$+++ u4524 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CUSTOMER +++$+++ You're shittin' me.
L134308 +++$+++ u4521 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ ACTIVIST +++$+++ That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.
L134307 +++$+++ u4524 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CUSTOMER +++$+++ What the hell is that?
L134306 +++$+++ u4521 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ ACTIVIST +++$+++ I'd say you're about nineteen, twenty, am I right?
L134302 +++$+++ u4524 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CUSTOMER +++$+++ What is this, a poll?
L134301 +++$+++ u4521 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ ACTIVIST +++$+++ How long have you been smoking?
L134300 +++$+++ u4524 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CUSTOMER +++$+++ Are you serious?
L134299 +++$+++ u4521 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ ACTIVIST +++$+++ Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?
L134298 +++$+++ u4524 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CUSTOMER +++$+++ Am I sure about what?
L134297 +++$+++ u4521 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ ACTIVIST +++$+++ Are you sure?
L134296 +++$+++ u4524 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CUSTOMER +++$+++ Am I sure?
L134295 +++$+++ u4521 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ ACTIVIST +++$+++ Are you sure?
L134363 +++$+++ u4521 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ ACTIVIST +++$+++ The ones in this town, yes! You encourage their growth, their habit. You're the source in this area, and we're going to shut you down for good! For good, cancer-merchant!
L134362 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
L134361 +++$+++ u4521 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ ACTIVIST +++$+++ What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
L134360 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Yeah, but not in here.
L134359 +++$+++ u4521 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ ACTIVIST +++$+++ We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
L134358 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ That's it, everybody out.
L134353 +++$+++ u4521 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ ACTIVIST +++$+++ You're the disturbance, pal! And here...  I'm buying some... what's this?... Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm no longer loitering. I'm a customer, a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers.
L134352 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.
L134351 +++$+++ u4521 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ ACTIVIST +++$+++ You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
L134350 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I think you'd better leave now.
L134349 +++$+++ u4521 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ ACTIVIST +++$+++ Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.  Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day."
L134348 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Hey, now wait a sec...
L134329 +++$+++ u4521 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ ACTIVIST +++$+++ Okay. I'm sorry about that.
L134328 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
L134327 +++$+++ u4521 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ ACTIVIST +++$+++ No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
L134326 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
L134325 +++$+++ u4521 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ ACTIVIST +++$+++ You've made a wise choice. Keep up the good work.
L134324 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Fifty-five.
L134316 +++$+++ u4521 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ ACTIVIST +++$+++ This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?
L134315 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Excuse me, but...
L134304 +++$+++ u4521 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ ACTIVIST +++$+++ How long have you been a smoker?
L134303 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Beats me.
L134291 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Sure. Go ahead.
L134290 +++$+++ u4521 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ ACTIVIST +++$+++ Do you mind if I drink this here?
L134289 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Thanks. Have a good one.
L135578 +++$+++ u4522 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ No, don't!
L135577 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Why?
L135570 +++$+++ u4522 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ I feel nauseous.
L135569 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Nobody! I swear!
L135561 +++$+++ u4522 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ You two better quit it.
L135560 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ I was here the whole time.
L135555 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ You dog! I didn't see you go back there.
L135554 +++$+++ u4522 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
L135553 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ He was?
L135552 +++$+++ u4522 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
L135551 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Am I missing something here?
L135533 +++$+++ u4522 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Awww. That was so cute.
L135532 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Territoriality. He was mine first.
L135531 +++$+++ u4522 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
L135530 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Hey Caitlin...  Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal.
L135529 +++$+++ u4522 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ I'll try to manage.
L135528 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
L135527 +++$+++ u4522 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Such a sordid state of affair.
L135526 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
L135525 +++$+++ u4522 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ You're kidding.
L135524 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
L135523 +++$+++ u4522 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Why aren't there any lights?
L135522 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ There's no light back there.
L135521 +++$+++ u4522 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Can I use the bathroom?
L135520 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ No, this is great.
L135519 +++$+++ u4522 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ God, isn't he great?
L135518 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ He went home to change for the big date.
L135517 +++$+++ u4522 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ So where is he?
L135516 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Exactly.
L135515 +++$+++ u4522 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Dick.
L135514 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
L135513 +++$+++ u4522 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
L135512 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
L135511 +++$+++ u4522 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
L135510 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Can I join in?
L135509 +++$+++ u4522 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ You can hold me down.
