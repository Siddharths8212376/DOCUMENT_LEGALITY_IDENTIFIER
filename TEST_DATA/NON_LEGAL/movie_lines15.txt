L6808 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
L6807 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
L6806 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm camera shy.
L6805 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ What's the problem?
L6804 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'd rather you didn't.
L6803 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?
L6802 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit?  Very good.
L6801 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ We can do that.
L6800 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
L6799 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ If it's not him, there's no deal.
L6798 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Machine.
L6797 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
L6796 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ I'll consider it.
L6795 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I want to watch you work.
L6794 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ And they are?
L6793 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
L6792 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Is it?
L6791 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ That's five thousand dollars.
L6790 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
L6789 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ You said something about money.
L6784 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Hmm.
L6783 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ A fellow investor.
L6782 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
L6781 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours.
L6780 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ What can I do for you today?
L6779 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
L6936 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ You betrayed us.
L6935 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?
L6912 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
L6911 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ ... sorry...
L6908 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Fuck off.
L6907 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Leave him alone.
L6906 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You're a dead man.
L6866 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Move it, dirtbag... !
L6865 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
L6848 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
L6847 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Is that him?
L6464 +++$+++ u104 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ It's good what you're doing.
L6463 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
L6462 +++$+++ u104 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
L6461 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Any good?
L6460 +++$+++ u104 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
L6454 +++$+++ u104 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
L6453 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
L6452 +++$+++ u104 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
L6451 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
L6450 +++$+++ u104 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ I'm not so sure about this.
L6449 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
L6448 +++$+++ u104 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ Why don't they come to me?
L6447 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
L6446 +++$+++ u104 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ We do.
L6445 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I figured you share information.
L6444 +++$+++ u104 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
L6443 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.
L6442 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
L6441 +++$+++ u104 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ There are reasons for the way we do things here.
L6440 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
L6439 +++$+++ u104 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ Alright, Tom.
L6438 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Call me Tom.
L6437 +++$+++ u104 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
L7076 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
L7075 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
L7074 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I never killed anyone.
L7073 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Easy enough for you.
L7072 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
L7071 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Don't think I won't.
L7070 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Do it.
L7067 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.
L7066 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Where?  Show me where.
L7065 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
L7064 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Show me where you buried her.
L7063 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You got absolute zero.
L7062 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Stop talking.
L7061 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
L7060 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?
L7059 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Keep moving.
L7057 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Show me.
L7056 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
L7055 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What did you do with her body?
L7054 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
L7053 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Nobody saw you bring her in?
L7052 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
L7051 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Tell me what happened.
L7050 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
L7049 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You enjoy it?
L7048 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.
L7045 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Because we're going there.
L7044 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Why?
L7043 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
L7039 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!
L7038 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
L7037 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What the fuck do you want from me?
L7036 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
L7035 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Something like that.
L7034 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
L7033 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ It was a lot of fucking money.
L7032 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
L7031 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
L7030 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ How much did he pay you?
L7029 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L7028 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Told him you could get him a snuff film.
L7027 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
L7026 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
L7025 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
L7024 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
L7023 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I told you, I don't know.
L7022 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I want his name.
L7021 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I don't know...
L7020 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Who is Machine?
L7019 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What do you want?
L7018 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Starting to recognize a pattern?
L7017 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Fuck you!
L7016 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Don't ask questions.
L7015 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ How'd you find me here?
L7014 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Don't bore me with that bullshit.
L7013 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I'm gonna kill you.
L6920 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
L6919 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What's he talking about?
L6702 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
L6701 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What the fuck are you.. ?
L6700 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
L6699 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Who is this.
L6698 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I know what you did.
L6697 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What?
L6696 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I know what you did.
L6695 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah, who's this?
L6694 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Eddie.
L6693 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Celebrity Films.
L6692 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Fuck you!
L6691 +++$+++ u107 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
L6690 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Look, you cocksucker...
L6689 +++$+++ u107 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
L6688 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
L6687 +++$+++ u107 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
L6686 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
L6922 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
L6921 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ He's lying.
L6903 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
L6902 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Give me the film.
L6901 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You'll get it when we get there.
L6900 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Give me the film.
L6899 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Fuck you.
L6898 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ You almost went over your limit.
L6894 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Because he could.  He did it because he could.  What other reason were you looking for?
L6893 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Enlighten me.
L6892 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Isn't it incredibly obvious?
L6891 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
L6890 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...
L6889 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm asking.
L6888 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ You're asking me why?
L6887 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
L6886 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ You're making me very angry.
L6885 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up?  Tell me, because I really want to understand.  Did he jerk off to it?  You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?
L6884 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Shut your mouth and drive!
L6883 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
L6882 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Shut up.
L6881 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
L6880 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her.
L6879 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
L6878 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
L6877 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ They're no friends of mine.
L6876 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
L6875 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Never mind how I found you.
L6874 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
L6873 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ I was well compensated.
L6872 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
L6871 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
L6870 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
L6869 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
L6868 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.
L6380 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.
L6379 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ That's right.
L6378 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ You are a private investigator?
L6377 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Of what sort?
L6376 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
L6375 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm listening.
L6374 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
L6824 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.
L6823 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Look... that's awful generous and everything...
L6822 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
L6821 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What's this?
L6819 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Nope.
L6818 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
