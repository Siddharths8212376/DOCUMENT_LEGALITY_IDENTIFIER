L48485 +++$+++ u3753 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ KURTZ +++$+++ Do you?
L48484 +++$+++ u3753 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ KURTZ +++$+++ That's right, the little gook- pricks. But they are noble little gook-pricks, noble. Because they fight with their guts, like animals. And for an idea ! That's rich. We fight with ingenious machines and fire, like Gods, and for nothing. But I'll call in a major blotto airstrike tonight. We'll have ourselves a helluva airstrike tonight, a lightshow. How do you like The Doors': 'C'mon Baby Light My Fire...'
L48483 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
L48482 +++$+++ u3753 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ KURTZ +++$+++ I said get the fuck out !  I'm going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow.  He's only stayed alive this long because he's a good orderly and medic. He knows how to use a hypodermic.
L48466 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ Yeah.
L48465 +++$+++ u3753 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ KURTZ +++$+++ Yeah, I can see that. He's fuckin nuts --

L48454 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ You know you're right.
L48453 +++$+++ u3753 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ KURTZ +++$+++ What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?
L48452 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ What do you mean, Colonel?
L48451 +++$+++ u3753 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ KURTZ +++$+++ You came up my river -- in that small boat. So simple. I always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did.  You are the final justice, aren't you?
L48450 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ No -- no, sir.
L48449 +++$+++ u3753 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ KURTZ +++$+++ You were not coming here, to see me?
L48448 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.
L48447 +++$+++ u3753 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ KURTZ +++$+++ Why did you come to ... my province.
L48445 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ Captain B.L. Willard reporting his presence, sir.
L48444 +++$+++ u3753 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ KURTZ +++$+++ I'm Kurtz.
L48443 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ Colonel Kurtz, I guess.
L48575 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ Yes I was... He said his last words to me.
L48574 +++$+++ u3754 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ KURTZ'S WIFE +++$+++ Were you with him, when...
L48573 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
L48572 +++$+++ u3754 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ KURTZ'S WIFE +++$+++ Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
L48571 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ Both of us...
L48570 +++$+++ u3754 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ KURTZ'S WIFE +++$+++ I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...
L48569 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ Yes, I know...
L48568 +++$+++ u3754 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ KURTZ'S WIFE +++$+++ You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --
L48567 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ You knew him best.
L48566 +++$+++ u3754 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ KURTZ'S WIFE +++$+++ Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
L48565 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --
L48564 +++$+++ u3754 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ KURTZ'S WIFE +++$+++ And you admired him?
L48563 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ You get to know each other pretty well out there.
L48562 +++$+++ u3754 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ KURTZ'S WIFE +++$+++ Did you know him very well?
L48427 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ Bring your rifles, that's all.  Take us to him.

L47986 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ It's a feeling you get in the jungle. When you get good, you can find a track and tell not only how many they are, but their morale, how far they're going, whether they're near their camp, the weapons they're carrying.
L47985 +++$+++ u3755 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ LANCE +++$+++ And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?
L47984 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ Sure.
L47983 +++$+++ u3755 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ LANCE +++$+++ Captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?
L47980 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ He's a man who knows what he wants -- he does know what he wants.
L47979 +++$+++ u3755 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ LANCE +++$+++ A Yater spoon is hard to get -- especially here.
L47978 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ I don't think he'd of shot us on the beach but -- he'd of shot us if he saw me taking the board --
L47977 +++$+++ u3755 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ LANCE +++$+++ Any time -- us -- Americans.

L47974 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
L47973 +++$+++ u3755 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ LANCE +++$+++ You hear it again?
L47967 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down.
L47966 +++$+++ u3755 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ LANCE +++$+++ Maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his Yater.
L47963 +++$+++ u3755 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ LANCE +++$+++ Yeah, Jesus Christ !
L47962 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ This one , Lance?

L47959 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ Which one's the Colonel's?
L47958 +++$+++ u3755 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ LANCE +++$+++ No -- no, Captain.
L47957 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ Then let's get the hell out of here.
L47956 +++$+++ u3755 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ LANCE +++$+++ Nah.
L47955 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
L47954 +++$+++ u3755 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ LANCE +++$+++ Yeah... thanks.
L47953 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ Are you finished surfing?
L47935 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ He can't kill us.  We're on his side.

L47920 +++$+++ u3755 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ LANCE +++$+++ Just something I read in the Free Press.

L47915 +++$+++ u3755 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ LANCE +++$+++ Maybe he'll get inside the tube -- where -- where they can't see him.
L47914 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ What?
L47913 +++$+++ u3755 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ LANCE +++$+++ Maybe he'll get tubed.
L48129 +++$+++ u3756 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ It's of strategic importance for keeping the highway into Bat Shan open -- the generals don't like to admit that Bat Shan is surrounded.
L48128 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ What is this bridge?
L48127 +++$+++ u3756 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --
L48126 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand?
L48125 +++$+++ u3756 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.
L48124 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ Why?
L48123 +++$+++ u3756 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ You don't know how happy that makes me, sir.
L48122 +++$+++ u3756 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ Captain Willard -- we got these from Nha Thrang two days ago -- they expected you here then --
L48121 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ That's me.
L48120 +++$+++ u3756 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ Captain Willard?
L48432 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ I'm not ever goin' to tell you to shut up again.
L48431 +++$+++ u3758 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ MOONBY +++$+++ His name is...
L48430 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ Who are you?
L48429 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ And shut up.
L48428 +++$+++ u3758 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ MOONBY +++$+++ Right on -- he's been waiting for --
L48425 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ We're going ashore. Tie her up -- and leave your guns up, Lance.
L48424 +++$+++ u3758 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ MOONBY +++$+++ Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
L48423 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
L48422 +++$+++ u3758 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ MOONBY +++$+++ No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.
L48421 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ Sounds like he's gone crazy.
L48418 +++$+++ u3758 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ MOONBY +++$+++ I've asked myself that question. I said to myself, why didn't he shoot me? He didn't shoot me, because I had a stash like you wouldn't believe. I hid it in the jungle; the wealth of the Orient: Marijuana -- Hashish -- Opium -- cocaine -- uncut Heroin; the Gold of the Golden Triangle. and Acid -- I make Koolaid that makes purple Owsley come on like piss. Now I'm Kurtz' own Disciple -- I listen he talks. About everything ! Everything. I forgot there's such a thing as sleep. Everything. Of love, too.
L48417 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ Why didn't he shoot you?
L48416 +++$+++ u3758 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ MOONBY +++$+++ But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.'
L48415 +++$+++ u3758 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ MOONBY +++$+++ Kurtz. I tell you, that man has enlarged my mind.
L48414 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ So Kurtz is alive.
L48413 +++$+++ u3758 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ MOONBY +++$+++ Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
L48412 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ You're Australian?
L48411 +++$+++ u3758 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ MOONBY +++$+++ Simple. They don't want him to go.
L48410 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ Why did they attack us?
L48409 +++$+++ u3758 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ MOONBY +++$+++ Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
L48408 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
L48407 +++$+++ u3758 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ MOONBY +++$+++ This boat's a mess.
L48341 +++$+++ u3760 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ ROXANNE +++$+++ Then Philippe will have to kill all of you.
L48340 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ What if I say no.
L48339 +++$+++ u3760 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ ROXANNE +++$+++ You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much.
L48338 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ So that's it.
L48337 +++$+++ u3760 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ ROXANNE +++$+++ Whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores -- a case of grenades, a mortar and two M-16's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order.
L48336 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ I'm afraid I won't have time -- I gotta --
L48332 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ The river is beautiful.
L48331 +++$+++ u3760 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ ROXANNE +++$+++ Are you warm, Captain?
L48329 +++$+++ u3760 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ ROXANNE +++$+++ But Captain, I mean -- cannibals.
L48328 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ I know.
L48327 +++$+++ u3760 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ ROXANNE +++$+++ Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages?
L48326 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ Yes.
L48325 +++$+++ u3760 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ ROXANNE +++$+++ Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.
L48324 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ What things?
L48323 +++$+++ u3760 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ ROXANNE +++$+++ That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.
L48322 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ What did you hear?
L48321 +++$+++ u3760 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ ROXANNE +++$+++ Yes.
L48320 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him.
L48319 +++$+++ u3760 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ ROXANNE +++$+++ What's a big question?
L48318 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
L48317 +++$+++ u3760 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ ROXANNE +++$+++ What will you do after the war?
L48315 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ No. Not really.
L48314 +++$+++ u3760 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ ROXANNE +++$+++ Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?
L48312 +++$+++ u3760 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ ROXANNE +++$+++ The war will still be here tomorrow.
L48311 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ I should be checking on the boat.
L48310 +++$+++ u3760 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ ROXANNE +++$+++ Cognac?
L48309 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ I'm sorry to hear that.
L48308 +++$+++ u3760 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ ROXANNE +++$+++ You must realize, Captain -- we have lost much here -- I, my husband. Gaston -- his wife and son.
L48300 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.
L48299 +++$+++ u3760 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ ROXANNE +++$+++ May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
L47758 +++$+++ u3761 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ No sir, I think -- this'll be a little bit different --
L47757 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ This -- Bob Hope or the like --

L47749 +++$+++ u3761 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ?
L47748 +++$+++ u3763 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ WILLARD +++$+++ They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
L47747 +++$+++ u3761 +++$+++ m247 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ I don't know anything about these papers, sir.
