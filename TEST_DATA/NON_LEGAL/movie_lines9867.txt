L248725 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ Split it up. Any word on Donny?
L248334 +++$+++ u5584 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ OTTO +++$+++ Ten points for our fearless leader ... Sway, how 'bout giving us the honor of the Bill Bixby trifecta -- ?
L248333 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
L248332 +++$+++ u5584 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ OTTO +++$+++ Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis?
L248119 +++$+++ u5584 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ OTTO +++$+++ In order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket. And...
L248118 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ Okay, then... Otto?
L248106 +++$+++ u5584 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ OTTO +++$+++ The conundrum still applies, of course. The purpose of the endeavor is to rescue baby brother from imminent death and/or a life of crime. However. This cannot be successfully carried out without baby brother's considerable resources, shabby though they may be.
L248105 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
L248104 +++$+++ u5584 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ OTTO +++$+++ I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
L248103 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ No we don't -
L248102 +++$+++ u5584 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ OTTO +++$+++ You need him...
L248090 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield?
L248089 +++$+++ u5584 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ OTTO +++$+++ Some crew you got ...
L248075 +++$+++ u5584 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ OTTO +++$+++ Go to them. They'll be happy to see you ... Ahhh...
L248074 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ And the moral of that story is -- ?
L248073 +++$+++ u5584 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ OTTO +++$+++ I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ...
L248072 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ I Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me
L248071 +++$+++ u5584 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ OTTO +++$+++ The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
L248070 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ Is he still working here ?
L248069 +++$+++ u5584 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ OTTO +++$+++ "A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
L248068 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ The hard part ...
L248067 +++$+++ u5584 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ OTTO +++$+++ It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
L248066 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ Tell me...
L248065 +++$+++ u5584 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ OTTO +++$+++ Are you considering a comeback tour?
L248064 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ You think it can be done?
L248062 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ He's gotten involved --
L248061 +++$+++ u5584 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ OTTO +++$+++ I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ...
L248059 +++$+++ u5584 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ OTTO +++$+++ What happened? Old-age happened. I tired of killing them. I woke up one morning and thought I am no longer a destroyer. I am a means of resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive. There are so few things in this life, we can prevent from decay. Most must die. These don't have to...
L248058 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
L248057 +++$+++ u5584 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ OTTO +++$+++ Whatever do you mean?
L248054 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ Of course. Hi, Junie --

L248051 +++$+++ u5584 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ OTTO +++$+++ Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life returning to bid a final farewell?  And have my angels completely lost their fashion sense -- ?
L248607 +++$+++ u5586 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen?
L248606 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up...
L248451 +++$+++ u5586 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ You sure I can't go with ya?
L248450 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?
L248404 +++$+++ u5586 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Come on. Kip, talk to the guy
L248403 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...
L248402 +++$+++ u5586 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ How come ... ?
L248401 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
L248400 +++$+++ u5586 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ What about me?
L248264 +++$+++ u5586 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ I can tell you who's gonna be on duty tonight. I can tell you how much gas they're using monthly. I can tell you how they used to spend that annoying half-hour between "FRIENDS" and "SEINFELD"...
L248263 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ So what's in there -- ?
L248262 +++$+++ u5586 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site, right? Then I monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? Then I got these ISDN numbers, right? Then I tracked them back, right? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest, right? Then I called back see, they think I'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like I'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? So now they're sharing it with me, right? They think I'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. So they let me in, right? Give me all these numbers. But then I don't leave, right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I just go anywhere I want.
L248253 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ She soars -
L248252 +++$+++ u5586 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ So she flies -
L248251 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ...
L248246 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ All the vehicles get code names. Female names. You say "Eleanor lives at such and such... " and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ...
L248245 +++$+++ u5586 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
L248244 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
L248243 +++$+++ u5586 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Who's "Eleanor?"
L248242 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.

L247756 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
L247755 +++$+++ u5587 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Not really -
L247754 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ You know what you got here?

L248592 +++$+++ u5586 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Which way's out, man -- ?
L248589 +++$+++ u5586 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Checkin' it out
L248588 +++$+++ u5588 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ TUMBLER +++$+++ What are you doing here, assface?
L247856 +++$+++ u5588 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ TUMBLER +++$+++ Oooh, ain't you the lucky duck --

L247854 +++$+++ u5588 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ TUMBLER +++$+++ Why don't you leave him alone?
L247853 +++$+++ u5586 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
L247852 +++$+++ u5588 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ TUMBLER +++$+++ What do you want, shithead?
L248998 +++$+++ u5598 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
L248997 +++$+++ u5589 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ ANGIE +++$+++ But he was always a bad kid, that one.
L248996 +++$+++ u5598 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
L248995 +++$+++ u5589 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ ANGIE +++$+++ What? What happened?
L248994 +++$+++ u5598 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Look at Jeannie's kid.
L248993 +++$+++ u5589 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ ANGIE +++$+++ You think I don't know? You think I like to keep this inside? But I gotta, or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. It's disgusting what you have to put up with.
L248772 +++$+++ u5590 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Come ooonnn. Tommeeee. We're only kidding. You can't take a joke? Come ooonn.
L248771 +++$+++ u5602 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ No more shines, Billy.
L248770 +++$+++ u5590 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great.  He made mirrors.
L248769 +++$+++ u5590 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Busting his balls?  If I was busting your balls, I'd send you home for your shine box.
L248768 +++$+++ u5602 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Don't go busting my balls. Okay?
L248767 +++$+++ u5590 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
L248766 +++$+++ u5602 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.
L248765 +++$+++ u5590 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Son of a bitch. Get over here.
L248764 +++$+++ u5602 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Billy, how are you?
L248763 +++$+++ u5590 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
L249390 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.
L249389 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ Here. Take it.  Now I gotta turn my back on you.
L249388 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ You treated me like shit.
L249387 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Paulie.  You're all I got.  I need help.
L249386 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
L249385 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ You thought I was some fucking jerk?
L249384 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
L249383 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
L249382 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
L249381 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ You think I didn't know what you were doing?
L249380 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I've been all fucked up since I got out.
L249379 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ I warned you a million times.
L249165 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I understand.
L249164 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ Anybody!  You understand?
L249163 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Nods again.
L249162 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
L249161 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Nods.
L249160 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?
L249159 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
L249158 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me.  You understand?
L249153 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Why would I get into that?
L249152 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.
L249151 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Me? Why would I get into that shit?
L249150 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
L249149 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Wha?  Me?
L249148 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ I don't want any more of that Shit.
L249036 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Oh I Him.
L249035 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
L249034 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ The guy from near where Christie used to live?
L249033 +++$+++ u5603 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ VARIO +++$+++ No. No. The guy from downtown.
L249032 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What thing? The Brooklyn thing?

L249434 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Yeah. What about the kids' school?
L249433 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What about the schools?
L249409 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I got scared.
L249408 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
L249407 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I got seared.
L249406 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What happened? You okay?
L249377 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Oh no! No!  Noooo!
L249376 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
L249375 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
L249374 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
L249373 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
L249372 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ You what?
L249371 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I flushed it down the toilet.
L249370 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ You know. The stuff I left.
L249369 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L249368 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Where's the stuff?
L249367 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ So now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope that the cops never found and disappear for a while until I got things straightened out.
L249364 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Just get me out.
L249363 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Who's gonna do that?
L249362 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
L249361 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Then you're safer in here.
L249360 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Fuck Jimmy and the money. Didn't I tell you I gotta get out of here first.  I gotta straighten every- thing out with Paulie or I'm dead.
L249359 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I told Jimmy the cops took our cars and froze our bank accounts and he offered to get me some money. Be wants to know what's happening. You gotta meet him.
L249358 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Paul will calm down. You'll see.
L249357 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
L249356 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What did he say, exactly?
L249355 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.
L249194 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Hello!  Hello!  Have a good flight?
L249193 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.

L249142 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Never.
L249141 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I don't want to hear about her anymore.
L249140 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
L249139 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
L249138 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.
L249137 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I can't do it anymore.
L249136 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
L249135 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
L249134 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ We've got to help each other.
L249133 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ He told me to take the kids to the police station and make the cops put me on welfare.
L249132 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ It'll be okay.
L249131 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
L249130 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Let her carry this shit inside.
L249129 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Stop! Stop!
L249126 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me.
L249125 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
L249124 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Jezuz Christ!
L249123 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
L249122 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L249121 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You son of a bitch. She's been here.
L249108 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Shit.
L249107 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
L249106 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I'm just having my last few drinks.
L249105 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?
L249085 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Son of a bitch.
L249084 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?
L249083 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ It's all bullshit. I swear. It's nothing. Whatever you want, we'll do.
L249080 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What's the matter with you?  You're crazy.
L249079 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Henry.  Wake up.
L249066 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ That again.
L249065 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I don't care. Something's going on.
L249018 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ How much?
L249017 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I'm gonna need some money.
L249002 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Are you nuts?  Jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don't have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. That's who. And they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car.
L249001 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband --
L248969 +++$+++ u5591 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.
L248968 +++$+++ u5594 +++$+++ m372 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ The bag with the envelopes.
