L162985 +++$+++ u776 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP'S VOICE +++$+++ Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
L162984 +++$+++ u774 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE +++$+++ Yeah, you did!
L162983 +++$+++ u776 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP'S VOICE +++$+++ I did?
L162982 +++$+++ u774 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE +++$+++ Trip? You just got yourself four tickets and four backstage passes to KISS live at Cobo Hall tonight!
L162981 +++$+++ u776 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP'S VOICE +++$+++ Yeah.
L162980 +++$+++ u774 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE +++$+++ Is that your final answer?
L162979 +++$+++ u776 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP'S VOICE +++$+++ Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter...Criscula! Yeah, that's it!
L162978 +++$+++ u774 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE +++$+++ I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
L162977 +++$+++ u776 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ TRIP'S VOICE +++$+++ Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
L162976 +++$+++ u774 +++$+++ m49 +++$+++ SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE +++$+++ Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.
L169012 +++$+++ u786 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ JIM CUNNINGHAM +++$+++ Now that's what I like to hear!  Because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears. They give in to their feelings of self-doubt... they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex. Empty solutions. These are toxic chemicals... and disease-spreading behaviour.
L169011 +++$+++ u777 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ AUDIENCE +++$+++ GOOD MORNING!
L169010 +++$+++ u786 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ JIM CUNNINGHAM +++$+++ Are you AFRAID?
L169009 +++$+++ u777 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ AUDIENCE +++$+++ GOOD MORNING!
L169008 +++$+++ u786 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ JIM CUNNINGHAM +++$+++ Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
L169007 +++$+++ u777 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ AUDIENCE +++$+++ Good MORNING!
L169006 +++$+++ u786 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ JIM CUNNINGHAM +++$+++ That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!"
L169005 +++$+++ u777 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ AUDIENCE +++$+++ Good morning...
L169004 +++$+++ u786 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ JIM CUNNINGHAM +++$+++ Good morning, mongrels!
L169319 +++$+++ u778 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Did you know him?
L169318 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Yeah.
L169317 +++$+++ u778 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I feel bad for his family.
L169316 +++$+++ u778 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Donnie. Donnie Darko.
L169315 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ What was his name?
L169314 +++$+++ u778 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ He got smooshed. By a jet engine.
L169313 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ What happened?
L169312 +++$+++ u778 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
L169311 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Hi... what's going on here?
L169122 +++$+++ u780 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. MONNITOFF +++$+++ Donnie, I'm afraid I can't continue this conversation. I could lose my job.
L169121 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
L169120 +++$+++ u780 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. MONNITOFF +++$+++ You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.
L169119 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
L169118 +++$+++ u780 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. MONNITOFF +++$+++ I'm not following you.
L169117 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
L169116 +++$+++ u780 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. MONNITOFF +++$+++ That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
L169115 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Could these wormholes appear in nature?
L169114 +++$+++ u780 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. MONNITOFF +++$+++ Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
L169113 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
L169112 +++$+++ u780 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. MONNITOFF +++$+++ Beg pardon?
L169111 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Like a spear.
L169110 +++$+++ u780 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. MONNITOFF +++$+++ Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
L169070 +++$+++ u780 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. MONNITOFF +++$+++ Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.
L169069 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
L169068 +++$+++ u780 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. MONNITOFF +++$+++ What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
L168915 +++$+++ u780 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. MONNITOFF +++$+++ A metal craft of any kind.
L168914 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Like a DeLorean.
L168913 +++$+++ u780 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. MONNITOFF +++$+++ The basic principles of time travel are there.  So you have the vessel and the portal. And the vessel can be anything. Most likely a spacecraft.
L168912 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ So... that's it?
L168911 +++$+++ u780 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. MONNITOFF +++$+++ A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
L168910 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ -- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
L168909 +++$+++ u780 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. MONNITOFF +++$+++ Theoretically.
L168908 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
L168907 +++$+++ u780 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. MONNITOFF +++$+++ So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
L168906 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I know that this is gonna sound kinda weird... but do you know anything about time travel?
L168905 +++$+++ u780 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. MONNITOFF +++$+++ Donnie.
L168904 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Dr. Monnitoff?
L168711 +++$+++ u793 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ SAMANTHA +++$+++ Donnie! Give it back!
L168710 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ "The Last Unicorn!" By Samantha Darko.
L168655 +++$+++ u793 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ SAMANTHA +++$+++ You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
L168654 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?
L168636 +++$+++ u793 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ SAMANTHA +++$+++ I'm telling Mom.
L168635 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
L168634 +++$+++ u793 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ SAMANTHA +++$+++ Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
L168575 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Not until like... eighth grade.
L168574 +++$+++ u793 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ SAMANTHA +++$+++ When can I squeeze one out?
L169288 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Our saviour...
L169287 +++$+++ u795 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ What did you say?
L169286 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Dea ex machina...
L168955 +++$+++ u795 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ You know what? I think that you did it.
L168954 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
L168953 +++$+++ u795 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
L168952 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I didn't say shit.
L168951 +++$+++ u795 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Did you tell them that I flooded the school?
L169091 +++$+++ u784 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.
L169090 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ How much longer is this gonna last?
L169089 +++$+++ u784 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
L169088 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Why do they call you Frank?
L169087 +++$+++ u784 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I am so sorry.
L169086 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ What happened to your eye?
L169084 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Take it off. I want to see you.
L169083 +++$+++ u784 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
L169082 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
L169081 +++$+++ u784 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You have a request?
L169080 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ You have to do something for me first.
L169079 +++$+++ u784 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I want to show you something.
L168855 +++$+++ u784 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
L168854 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Where did you come from?
L168853 +++$+++ u784 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You'll know soon enough.
L168852 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Who is... we?
L168851 +++$+++ u784 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We just want to guide you in the right direction.
L168850 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Why did you make me flood the school?
L168836 +++$+++ u784 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I can do anything I want... and so can you...
L168835 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ How can you do that?
L169307 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
L169306 +++$+++ u791 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!
L168829 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.
L168828 +++$+++ u791 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ How old is Grandma Death?
L168652 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I don't wanna talk about it.
L168651 +++$+++ u791 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
L168650 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ We went to a hotel.
L168649 +++$+++ u791 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!
L169280 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Yeah...
L169279 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Is that a cellar door?
L169275 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Who's Frank?
L169274 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ No. Frank.
L169273 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Why? Is this about the book?
L169272 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
L169270 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Where are we going?
L169269 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Come with me.
L169265 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
L169264 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ What?
L169260 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ It's safe here.
L169259 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
L169258 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
L169257 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Did you call the cops?
L169256 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ But you're OK?
L169255 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
L169254 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Where is she?
L169253 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ My mom is gone.
L169252 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Hey. You OK?
L169251 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Hey.
L169170 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Then when? I have to talk to you.
L169169 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
L169168 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Will you please talk to me?
L169142 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L169141 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ What's wrong with you?
L169140 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?
L169099 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ The whole movie. Let's go.
L169098 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ What? How long was I asleep?
L169067 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
L169066 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
L169065 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Infant Memory Generators.
L169064 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ So, we call them... IMGs.
L169044 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Maybe she's asleep.
L169043 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I know she's here. She never leaves the house.
L169042 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?
L169041 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?
L169040 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ The old crazy woman who lives off Old Gun Road.
L169039 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Who?
L169038 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?
L169037 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Are you okay?
L169036 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ They suspended me for two days.
L169016 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ What?
L169015 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ We're moving through time.
L168973 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
L168972 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
L168971 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
L168970 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ That's alright... I understand.
L168969 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ You want to kiss me...
L168968 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Well...
L168967 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ And what?
L168966 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...
L168965 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be.
L168964 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ With, like, images?
L168963 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
L168962 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Why not just buy your baby a night light?
L168961 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.
L168958 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?
L168957 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ What happened to your neck?
L168874 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Well... maybe someone is, like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking ...is someone showing you the way.
L168873 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Why?
L168872 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
L168871 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Yeah?
L168870 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Donnie?
L168869 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ And you'd never been there before?
L168868 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
L168867 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
L168866 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
L168865 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ My dad said never wake a sleepwalker... because they could drop dead.
L168864 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
L168863 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?
L168783 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ I'm going home.
L168782 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Where are you going?
L168781 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Sure.
L168780 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
L168779 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Where are we going?
L168778 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Will you go with me?
L168777 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ That was a compliment.
L168776 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L168775 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ You're weird.
L168774 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ We never would have had this conversation.
L168773 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Why is that?
L168772 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ It's a good thing the school was flooded today.
L168771 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Until it withers away.
L168770 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
L168769 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Wonder where we'll be then.
L168768 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
L168767 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ You mean soap?
L168766 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I mean, the whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine.
L168765 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ That's easy. Antiseptics.
L168764 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
L168763 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ What makes you think I'm not?
L168762 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
L168761 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.

L168758 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
L168757 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?
L168756 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.
