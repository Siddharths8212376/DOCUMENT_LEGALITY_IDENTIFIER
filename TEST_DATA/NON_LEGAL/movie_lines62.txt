L61850 +++$+++ u431 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LITE +++$+++ Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
L61849 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
L61848 +++$+++ u431 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LITE +++$+++ Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
L61847 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
L61846 +++$+++ u431 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LITE +++$+++ OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
L61717 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Yeah. I'm sure.
L61716 +++$+++ u431 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LITE +++$+++ Are you sure?
L61715 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit. Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are a fucking lock. I wanna make some money.
L61714 +++$+++ u431 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LITE +++$+++ How about 7 1/2?
L61713 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ I want 15 on the Mets.
L61712 +++$+++ u431 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LITE +++$+++ All right. What are you gonna do?
L61711 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the $800.
L61864 +++$+++ u434 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
L61863 +++$+++ u433 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.
L61862 +++$+++ u433 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ Yesterday morning, God gave me but one chance to use something else to serve Him. Not my arms or my legs, but something I used for the first time, for the last time, and will never use again. My vagina.
L61861 +++$+++ u434 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ Yes, Sister?
L61860 +++$+++ u433 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --
L61859 +++$+++ u434 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.
L61858 +++$+++ u433 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?
L61857 +++$+++ u434 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
L61856 +++$+++ u433 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?
L61855 +++$+++ u434 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --
L61854 +++$+++ u433 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil.
L63586 +++$+++ u435 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ 1/16TH BLACK +++$+++ Yo Black, you looking for trouble.

L62749 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
L62748 +++$+++ u437 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ BIG BLACK +++$+++ There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
L62747 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
L62746 +++$+++ u437 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ BIG BLACK +++$+++ So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
L62745 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ You don't have the demographics.
L62744 +++$+++ u437 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ BIG BLACK +++$+++ C'mon, why not?  The Monkees had a show.  Look at all that other junk that's on TV.  We got underground cult following.
L62743 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
L62742 +++$+++ u437 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ BIG BLACK +++$+++ Yeah, him.
L62741 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Delacroix.
L62740 +++$+++ u437 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ BIG BLACK +++$+++ If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?
L62739 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Please.
L62738 +++$+++ u437 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ BIG BLACK +++$+++ We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
L62737 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Who are you revolting against?
L62736 +++$+++ u437 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ BIG BLACK +++$+++ So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
L62735 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
L62734 +++$+++ u437 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ BIG BLACK +++$+++ My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
L62733 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
L62732 +++$+++ u437 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ BIG BLACK +++$+++ Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.

L62730 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
L62729 +++$+++ u437 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ BIG BLACK +++$+++ Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is...
L62728 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.

L63481 +++$+++ u453 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ TAVIS SMILEY +++$+++ Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there.  We can all agree to disagree without making threats.
L63480 +++$+++ u437 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ BIG BLACK +++$+++ And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better...
L63476 +++$+++ u437 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ BIG BLACK +++$+++ I'm a revolutionary.

L63431 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ I'm so tired of you running that. I always worked hard for you.  You think I'm a leech, a kling-on, I quit.
L63430 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
L63429 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ You can walk away.  We both can.
L63428 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
L63427 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ You're in this up till ya neck.

L63419 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
L63254 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Look at my lips.
L63253 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Why they gotta make my nose so big?
L62898 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ In fact, we never knew she had any friends period.
L62897 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
L62896 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Please, have a seat.
L62891 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Must be the pressure.
L62890 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ What's wrong with him?
L62881 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ You ain't happy about the green light?
L62880 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ DeLa - what's the matter with you.

L62825 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
L62824 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
L62823 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.

L62820 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ You might be right.
L62819 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.
L62845 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ That can be done.
L62844 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ We might need some mo' money behind this.
L62843 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.
L62757 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ And this is Manray.

L62700 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?
L62695 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Different.
L62694 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ What kind of show is this gonna be?
L62690 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ First things first.  I have to know if Manray is up for this.
L62689 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ How much?
L62688 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.
L62682 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Manray needs a job.
L62681 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ No offense.
L62680 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
L62679 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
L62562 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?

L62560 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
L62559 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Good morning, Cheeba.
L62842 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
L62841 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ That ain't funny.
L62686 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ We're starving.
L62685 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
L62684 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ We was coming to see you.
L62683 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.
L62646 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
L62645 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?
L62629 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ I'm tired of waiting.
L62628 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
L62627 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ And I'm the feet.
L62626 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
L62625 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
L62624 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Ahh, the luxuries of life.
L62622 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Did we get our bill yet?
L62621 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
L62620 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
L62619 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ I'm starvin' like Marvin.
L63568 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ No costume.  No blackface.
L63567 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
L63566 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.
L63565 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ I won't do it anymore.

L63326 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon.
