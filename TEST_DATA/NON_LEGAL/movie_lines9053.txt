L203302 +++$+++ u893 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Okay, "mom."
L203301 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Stop it.
L203300 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Johnny.
L203299 +++$+++ u893 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
L203297 +++$+++ u893 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Please tell me you go silent too.
L203296 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Apparently I can disappear.
L203093 +++$+++ u893 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
L203092 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
L203336 +++$+++ u894 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.
L203335 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Front page?
L203334 +++$+++ u894 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
L203333 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
L203263 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine."
L203262 +++$+++ u894 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --
L203261 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing...
L203260 +++$+++ u894 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ You know, maybe you should get some rest --
L203259 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ And that's a good thing?
L203258 +++$+++ u894 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
L203257 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've got to do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side.
L203256 +++$+++ u894 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
L203255 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
L203254 +++$+++ u894 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
L203253 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ How's the IPO?
L203126 +++$+++ u894 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
L203125 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Leonard, how's the feed?
L203104 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ History, Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
L203103 +++$+++ u894 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Then what is it?
L203102 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
L203101 +++$+++ u894 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
L203100 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Showtime.
L203099 +++$+++ u894 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ They're ready for you, sir.
L203061 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
L203060 +++$+++ u894 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ And if he's not...?
L203059 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
L203904 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
L203903 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ I found a broken gasket, from space --
L203885 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ I'm sure I can come up with something.
L203884 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
L203779 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ You need a doctor.
L203778 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
L203777 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
L203776 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ I can... make it work.
L203726 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
L203725 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Why didn't you say something?
L203724 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
L203723 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.
L203722 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you... speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
L203719 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ I gave him twenty.
L203718 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
L203717 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Of course I was. I'd read all your papers on bioethics. Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
L203716 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ You were?
L203715 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
L203714 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
L203713 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
L203682 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ I'm not the only one in there. I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
L203681 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
L203680 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --
L203679 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Better than your life. Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing. We are.
L203678 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
L203677 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
L203596 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
L203595 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Reed. How close are we to a cure?
L203531 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
L203530 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
L203529 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Of course. Of course.
L203528 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
L203527 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
L203526 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ And reverse the mutations --
L203525 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
L203524 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy, those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
L203523 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ What are you doing?
L203494 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.
L203493 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ There were a lot of variables to consider --
L203492 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
L203491 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ I think it was a little more complicated than --
L203490 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
L203489 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ No, I distinctly remember: you walked out my door. Ergo...
L203488 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Are you kidding?
L203487 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ I mean, you broke up with me, right?
L203486 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ What in the world would give me that idea?
L203485 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
L203483 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ I'm sure I can come up with something.
L203482 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
L203481 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Anger. Rage. Frustration.
L203480 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when --
L203479 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Excuse me?
L203478 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
L203474 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
L203473 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge.
L203420 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ If it happened to him, then it could...
L203419 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ That's what we're here to find out.
L203418 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
L203358 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ What...?  Oh.
L203357 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
L203355 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ We need to get past them.
L203354 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ What?
L203292 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
L203291 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
L203289 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Sue... look at your hands.
L203288 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ What? What do you mean you --
L203287 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Uh, Sue...? I can't.
L203282 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
L203281 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ For science.
L203280 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Passion.
L203279 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Which was?
L203278 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
L203277 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ You're happy for me and Victor.
L203275 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
L203274 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ That's good. That's uh... good.
L203273 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Yes, thanks.
L203272 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Feeling better?
L203096 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Great minds think alike.
L203095 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.
L203077 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
L203076 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
L203075 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ It's been changed.
L203074 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ I, uh, think I remember the number.
L203071 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Right. That's exactly what I meant.
L203070 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Well, uh, based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
L203069 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ I was talking about us. Working together.
L203068 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
L203045 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Never better.
L203044 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
L203670 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.
L203669 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ But I'm not done with the machine --
L203668 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ What I should have done a long time ago. Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
L203667 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L203443 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I don't want to understand it. This isn't one of your science projects. I just want to fix it. Fast!
L203442 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
L203441 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
L203440 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
L203439 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --
L203436 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
L203435 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
L203316 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
L203315 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Ben did this?
L203314 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Ben did this.
L203313 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
L203172 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
L203171 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Not until Ben is back inside!
L203168 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Reed, we're running out of time.
L203167 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Come on, Ben, come on...
L203161 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly.
L203160 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Ben's still out there --
L203159 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
L203158 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ We've got minutes until it hits, not hours... Victor, that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort.
L203137 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Sure.
L203136 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
L203058 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Hilarious.
L203057 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
L203051 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.
L203050 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
L203047 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Not at all.
L203046 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
L203034 +++$+++ u895 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...
L203033 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
L203577 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.
L203576 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Oh, I think you already have.
L203575 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Please don't make this personal --
L203574 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
L203573 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
L203572 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
L203571 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
L203569 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Susan. What are you doing?
L203568 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
L203567 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask you...
L203566 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ You said it was urgent.
L203431 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
L203430 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
L203429 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
L203428 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Victor, your scar --
L203319 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Just find him.
L203318 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Victor, I'm sorry I --
L203312 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Victor, are you feeling alright?
L203311 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ What's going on?
L203175 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ You can't leave them out there.
L203174 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Raising the shields.
L203173 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ What are you doing?
L203155 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
L203154 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
L203153 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
L203152 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
L203147 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.
L203146 +++$+++ u897 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ I understand the business reasons.
L203145 +++$+++ u899 +++$+++ m58 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
