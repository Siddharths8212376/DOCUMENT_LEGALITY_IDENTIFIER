L508407 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
L508406 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.
L508164 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Pray. 
L508163 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
L508162 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
L508161 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me!
L508160 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna take.
L508157 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ With nuns?  With rulers?  No way.  I'm gonna go back, work things out with Vince.
L508156 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
L508155 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em.
L508154 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Safest place in the world.  You think Vince would look for you here?
L508153 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I hate you.  I totally hate you.
L508152 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I'm gonna put you in the last place on Earth that Vince would ever look for you.
L508151 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
L508150 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ No nothing.
L508149 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Okay -- no limo.
L508148 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
L508141 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Maybe Hawaii.
L508140 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Okay, here's what I want.  I know about this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With room service.
L508139 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Get a stenographer.
L508138 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
L508137 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
L508136 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Ten flights?
L508129 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Then-you run.
L508128 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ And if I don't?
L508118 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Screw you!
L508117 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ He didn't do you a favor.
L508116 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I don't know anything about bodies!  I mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let me sing.
L508113 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I never said he was an altar boy, okay? But he sent his goons after me!  They tried to kill me!  I'm not kidding!
L508112 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
L508111 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Right between the eyes!  Down and out! The guy was gone!  I... I couldn't believe it!
L508072 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Think again!  And get out of here.
L508071 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Information, baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
L508070 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant?  What do you want -- cheap thrills?
L508069 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ A what? When are you qonna wake up?
L508068 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ He's a businessman.
L508065 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt? You were singing in bowling alleys back then.  I told people you were a hooker!
L508064 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ 'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
L508063 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ So I don't shop.
L508062 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?  A travel iron?
L508061 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
L508060 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
L508059 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang.
L508726 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ But -- wait.
L508725 +++$+++ u7634 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK AND ROBERT +++$+++ Really.
L508724 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
L508723 +++$+++ u7634 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK AND ROBERT +++$+++ Oh-huh.
L508722 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
L508721 +++$+++ u7634 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK AND ROBERT +++$+++ Hail, Mary.
L508720 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Hey, girls.
L508322 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I wouldn't even tell the Pope.
L508321 +++$+++ u7640 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ TATE +++$+++ You won't even tell us?
L508320 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Where's who?
L508319 +++$+++ u7640 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ TATE +++$+++ Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?
L508318 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a wonderful world.  Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  Dead or alive.
L508133 +++$+++ u7640 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ TATE +++$+++ They open a window.
L508132 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Then one day they find you.
L508125 +++$+++ u7640 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ TATE +++$+++ A hiding place.
L508124 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ We could put you into our witness protection program.
L508543 +++$+++ u7636 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I'm telling you!
L508542 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ A nun?
L508540 +++$+++ u7636 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ That she's a nun!  That chick you're looking for -- she's a nun!
L508539 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ We didn't tell you what?
L508538 +++$+++ u7636 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ But you didn't tell me!
L508537 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ We're the guys from Vegas.  You had Christy last night, but you let her get away.  It's upsetting.
L508536 +++$+++ u7636 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Who are you guys?
L508535 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into him.
L508533 +++$+++ u7636 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ You found him -- but we're not open yet.
L508532 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ We're looking for Mike.
L509034 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad!
L509033 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
L509030 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Where is she?
L509029 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ Joey?
L509022 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ Willy -- hit the lights.
L509021 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I can't see anything in here!
L509017 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Which one?
L509016 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ There she is!
L509010 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Which one!
L509009 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ Get her!
L508981 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Maybe pants.
L508980 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ I'm telling you, she's not a nun!  Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes.
L508977 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ So, take it off.
L508976 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Right.
L508973 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ You were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot.
L508972 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ It didn't work, Vince.
L508971 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ Well?
L508955 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Yeah...
L508954 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ I can't believe this.  Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.
L508951 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ It didn't happen.
L508950 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?
L508947 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ What's the problem?
L508946 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Not... totally.
L508945 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ It's done?
L508261 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ You know so much.  They've got Christy, and we've got to find her.  Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge.  Fax it to every contact we got.
L508260 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ It's a bluff, Vince.
L508259 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ He's so damn cocky.  This is different.
L508105 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ Take care of it.
L508104 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ And if she runs?
L508101 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ Maybe. 
L508100 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Vince -- is she... okay?
L508991 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ She's praying.
L508990 +++$+++ u7642 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ What's she doing?
L508983 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ And then we can ice her.  No nun, no evil eye.
L508982 +++$+++ u7642 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ A sweater.
L508979 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ For like, twelve zillion eternities?
L508978 +++$+++ u7642 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ Strip down a nun?  You want us to fry?
L508964 +++$+++ u7642 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ That's what I figured, too.
L508963 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
L508962 +++$+++ u7642 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ Neither did you!
L508961 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ You didn't shoot!
L508953 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ No smart-ass remarks or nothing.
L508952 +++$+++ u7642 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.
L508880 +++$+++ u7642 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ Forget her!  We got the one we need! Step on it!
L508879 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ She's gettin' away!
L508847 +++$+++ u7642 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ Yeah, right -- when I see it.
L508846 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ So that guy in the bar was right?  She's like... some kind of nun?
L508898 +++$+++ u7632 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY LAZARUS +++$+++ We can't leave it up to the Feds!
L508897 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ We've got to save her!
L508892 +++$+++ u7632 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY LAZARUS +++$+++ That should have tipped us.
L508891 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
L508860 +++$+++ u7632 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY LAZARUS +++$+++ We're losing it.
L508859 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
L508818 +++$+++ u7632 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY LAZARUS +++$+++ Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  Sharp.
L508817 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ It should be here any minute.
L508683 +++$+++ u7632 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY LAZARUS +++$+++ Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
L508682 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
L508921 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ Measles.
L508920 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ However, we can also pray for other things.
L508919 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ Peace on Earth.
L508903 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ All right.  It's a beginning.  Las Vegas, Nevada.
L508902 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ She told us about one.  The Little Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.
L508884 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
L508883 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ She shouldn't have come back.  She knew she was in danger.
L508655 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Really...
L508654 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ Bless her!  There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve.  That's why many of us became nuns.  It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.
L508398 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
L508397 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
L508330 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ I need to see you, at once.  Girls, please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments.  Mary Clarence?
L508329 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ Yes?
L508328 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Sister Mary Patrick?
L508238 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
L508237 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Yes, Mary Patrick?
L509048 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ Impossible.
L509047 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Not a note.
L509038 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ Christy.
L509037 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
L508998 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ A Benedictine.
L508997 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
L508969 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ But how do we get there?
L508968 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
L508943 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...
L508942 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ It's so beautiful...
L508894 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ She's our inspiration!
L508893 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Well, I don't care who she is.  We can't sing without her!
L508888 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ She wasn't a nun?
L508887 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ An... entertainer?
L508882 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
L508881 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ You mean -- they kidnapped her?
L508838 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ We'll pray -- and she'll be there.
L508837 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ We can't sing without her!  What should we do?
L508835 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ It's no use.  She just isn't here.
L508834 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ Mary Clarence!  Sister!
L508797 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
L508796 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Mary Clarence, don't be silly.  You're an example to us all.  You've taught us so much.  We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows?  Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes.
L508790 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
L508789 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Ice cream!
L508752 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ It's brought people back to the church.
L508751 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style.
L508742 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ It's better than springtime.
L508741 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ It's better than ice cream.
L508740 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ I'd rather sing than do anything!
L508732 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ He's kind.
L508731 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ He's decent.
L508730 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ He's not like other guys.
L508579 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ That was exciting!
L508578 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ We did it!  We actually sang a chord!
L508549 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ Really, Mary Clarence?  Were you a choirmistress?
L508548 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.
L508294 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ Which convent was that, Sister?
L508293 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Is this like your old convent?
L509063 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Since Mary Clarence came to St. Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer. Is that enough experience yet?  For final vows?
L509062 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Yes?
L509061 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Reverend Mother?
L508966 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ But where?
L508965 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
L508901 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ But... she was a showgirl.  She didn't have an old convent.
L508900 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ She said they were from her old convent.
L508899 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Calm down.  Think clearly.  Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?
L508862 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her.  Pull yourselves together.
L508861 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ I don't understand.  Where is she?
L508659 +++$+++ u7638 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ O'HARA +++$+++ And you'll face that danger head-on.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
L508658 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
L508174 +++$+++ u7638 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ O'HARA +++$+++ I know. 
L508173 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ I lied.
L508172 +++$+++ u7638 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ O'HARA +++$+++ St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need.
L508171 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ But, Bishop...
L508170 +++$+++ u7638 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ O'HARA +++$+++ Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
L508169 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
L508168 +++$+++ u7638 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ O'HARA +++$+++ And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
L508167 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ But she's been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.
