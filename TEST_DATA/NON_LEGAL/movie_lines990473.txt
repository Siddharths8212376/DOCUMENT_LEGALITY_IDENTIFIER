L634167 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Open up!
L634166 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ What you want?
L633992 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ When I work on a car, I work on a car.
L633991 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
L633990 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.
L633989 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
L633988 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Darrell. I'll get you your money. I just have to get something out of the trunk.
L633987 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Darrell.
L633986 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Look, Harlin.
L633983 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight. Maybe two.
L633982 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No! Okay! Okay!
L633980 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Listen to me you sorry sonufabitch. You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it.  And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on it. Is that clear? Now get out of here 'fore I call the Sheriff, <u>who knows me</u>.
L633979 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
L633978 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
L633977 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
L633976 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
L633975 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What sign?
L633974 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.
L633973 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
L633972 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Yeah, but it was shot.
L633971 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
L633970 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty.
L633969 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
L633968 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
L633967 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What?
L633966 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Two-hundred.
L633965 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
L633964 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ No charge.
L633963 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
L633962 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ You think bad, and bad is what you get.
L633961 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You believe that?
L633960 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
L633959 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You've been there?
L633958 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
L633957 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
L633956 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so good.
L633632 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ I want my hundred and forty-five dollars.
L633631 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
L633630 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
L633629 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
L633628 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ ...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't worth a duck's fart . This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this .
L633625 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
L633624 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I don't have a goddamn credit card.
L633623 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole.  You can keep that dollar. Now why don't you just take your American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV and have him send you the money lickity split.
L633621 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Listen, man.  I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had.
L633620 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Then you ain't gonna have the car.
L633619 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
L633618 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through."  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
L633617 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
L633616 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ "That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
L633615 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
L633614 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
L633613 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
L633612 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
L633611 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
L633610 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Hundred-fifty.
L633609 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ How much!?
L633608 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
L633607 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Bottom hose was shot too.  Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now.
L633606 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What the hell happened to my car?
L633605 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
L633604 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
L633603 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Don't look like nothing.
L633602 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Nothing.
L633601 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
L633600 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Hey.
L633345 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'll be back in a couple of hours.  And be careful with her, will you?
L633344 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
L633343 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
L633342 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
L633341 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Accident.
L633339 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Ninety-two.  Course half hour from now might be seventy-two. These clouds move around a lot.
L633338 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
L633337 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Twenty-after-ten.
L633336 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Time.
L633335 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ How much time?
L633334 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
L633333 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Great!
L633332 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Yeah, I can fix it.
L633331 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
L633330 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Somewhere else?  Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...
L633329 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
L633328 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
L633327 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
L633326 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
L633325 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ So?
L633324 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ OK. Darrell... Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
L633323 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Darrell--
L633322 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.
L633321 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither.  Then of course the clouds come in...
L633320 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You want to take a look at my car?  I think the radiator hose is--
L633319 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ So?
L633318 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ But he's dead.
L633317 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ 'Cause Harlin used to own it.
L633316 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Then why do you call it Harlin's?
L633315 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Yep.
L633314 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You own this place?
L633313 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
L633312 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Will he be back soon?
L633311 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ He's up at the Look Out.
L633310 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Harlin around?
L633309 +++$+++ u8685 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ DARRELL +++$+++ Nope.  Darrell.
L633308 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You Harlin?
L633597 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No! No police.
L633596 +++$+++ u8694 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ I call the sheriff.
L633570 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Soda.  You know.
L633569 +++$+++ u8694 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
L633568 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Soda.  You got any soda?
L633567 +++$+++ u8694 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Eh?
L633566 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Got any cold soda?
L634299 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!
L634298 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ <u>Jake</u>...
L634295 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
L634294 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ And I love you too.
L634293 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ 'Cause I love you.
L634292 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Why's that?
L634287 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. It should reach down here. Go get it, throw it down.
L634286 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Can you make it back up?
L634285 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I busted my leg!
L634284 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Bobby? Are you all right?
L634283 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Thank you. Thank you. I...I knew you wouldn't leave me, Grace.
L634277 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ But we all need that too. Hold him.
L634276 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Hope is a four-letter word.
L634274 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Save the Mom routine, will ya Grace. It doesn't work with me. One, two, three...
L634273 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ My mother died in this canyon.
L634272 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Time to go for a walk, Jake.
L634268 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I think you're a lying, back-stabbing psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me. But it's nice to know you cared...
L634267 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
L634266 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen.
L634265 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You lied to me all along! Lies, all lies. Your mother, your father, what story are you on now?  How come the town didn't know you was his daughter?
L634264 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
L634263 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
L634262 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
L634261 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the money, then you're on your own.
L634258 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I believe in this moment, that's all. There is nothing else.  Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds.
L634257 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
L634256 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.
L634254 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You could give me my gun back.
L634253 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?
L634252 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You think now that Jake's dead, there's all that money there and I don't need you anymore, and I might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop!
L634251 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No Grace, my hand's bothering me.
L634244 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ <u>I don't know why</u>!
L634243 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Why?
L634241 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Don't you really want to know? Was Jake my Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don't you want to know that?
L634240 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...
L634239 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
L634238 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
L634237 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ So, aren't you going to ask me?
L634236 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ He was a scumbag!... He wanted <u>me</u>, Bobby. These guys don't let go! Even when they're <u>dead</u>...  You don't know what it was like, Bobby. Those two, they were the same.
L634235 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
L634234 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
L634233 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
L634232 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.
L634206 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L634205 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You know I thought you'd left me back there.
L634204 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You already have.
L634203 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
L634202 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
L634201 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Anywhere?
L634200 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.
L634199 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ But I thought --
L634198 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'm not sailing his boat.
L634197 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
L634196 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
L634195 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
L634194 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
L634193 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
L634192 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I don't know about that?
L634191 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
L634190 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?
L634188 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!
L634187 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I can't see it.
L634185 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I'm not coming back.
L634184 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Good thinking.  What's all this?
L634183 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
L634182 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
L634181 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?
L634161 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No! You get it!
L634160 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ The money's right here! Get the key!
L634061 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
L634060 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Grace ... Grace?
L634059 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
L634058 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You said you couldn't kill anybody.
L634057 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.  The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it.  It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here.  But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
L634056 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Are you sure?...  About me, I mean?
L634055 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I don't give a damn about the money.  I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
L634054 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
L634053 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I could if I had Jake's money.
L634052 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I thought you couldn't get your car.
L634051 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
L634050 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Because I know you're full of shit.
L634049 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
L634048 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Stop it.
L634047 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. 
L634046 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ There is no us, remember?
L634045 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What about us?
L634044 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I don't think we have anything to talk about.
L634043 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I wanted to talk.
L633871 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
L633870 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
