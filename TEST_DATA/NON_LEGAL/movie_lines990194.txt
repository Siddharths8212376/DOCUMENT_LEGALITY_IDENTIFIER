L438823 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
L438810 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ Peggy, do you know what a penis is?  Stay away from it.
L438809 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ What do you mean?
L438808 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing?
L438807 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
L438806 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
L438805 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
L438804 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
L438803 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
L438802 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
L438801 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I had a dream that Grandma died.
L438800 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ What happened to you?
L438798 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
L438797 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
L438796 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Sure, Mom.  Hello.
L438795 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ Would you get that, dear?
L438794 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch.
L438793 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
L438792 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Who was that man?
L438661 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ The house payments.
L438660 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ What about?
L438659 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Sort of.
L438658 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
L438657 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
L438645 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.
L438644 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ When did you start drinking coffee?
L438639 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today.  Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health.
L438638 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ You're looking pretty chipper this morning.
L438637 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Oh. I forgot.
L438636 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
L438628 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
L438627 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.
L438590 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I'm home now.
L438589 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ Of course, dear. You're home now.
L438588 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
L438587 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Mom!
L438586 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ Why don't you go lie down for a while.
L438585 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I'm excused.
L438584 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ How do you feel?
L438583 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I have a note.
L438582 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
L438581 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Mom!
L439061 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.
L439060 +++$+++ u7024 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ You think this'll cheer Dad up?
L438654 +++$+++ u7024 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Can I tell Diane that Peggy Sue got drunk or is that a deep family secret?  Well?
L438653 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Mom, sit down for a minute. This is so nice, all of us being together again like this.
L438650 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.
L438649 +++$+++ u7024 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ And the butter.
L438605 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ They're bad for you. They cause...red lips. 
L438604 +++$+++ u7024 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Why not? They're my favorite.
L438603 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Don't eat the red ones.
L438602 +++$+++ u7024 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
L438601 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ It's unbelievable. The man never ages.
L438600 +++$+++ u7024 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Okay, what do you want? What dumb favor do you want me to do?
L438599 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
L438598 +++$+++ u7024 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.
L438597 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
L438596 +++$+++ u7024 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
L438595 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I'm just happy to see you.
L438594 +++$+++ u7024 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ What are you doing?
L439283 +++$+++ u7027 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ ROSALIE +++$+++ You're sick. You should go to the nurse. I'm going to tell Miss Dennis.
L439282 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
L439281 +++$+++ u7027 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ ROSALIE +++$+++ Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
L439280 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ But accidents can happen.
L439279 +++$+++ u7027 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ ROSALIE +++$+++ I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.
L439278 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
L439277 +++$+++ u7027 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ ROSALIE +++$+++ Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
L439276 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
L439275 +++$+++ u7027 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ ROSALIE +++$+++ What's up?
L438485 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ You have an incredible memory.
L438484 +++$+++ u7027 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ ROSALIE +++$+++ I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
L438483 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Rosalie Testa!
L438482 +++$+++ u7027 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ ROSALIE +++$+++ I remember that dress.
L439429 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ You can't. You're going to be Valedictorian.
L439428 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Wait! I'll go with you!
L439427 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
L439426 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
L439425 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.
L439424 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Did you break up with Charlie?
L439423 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.
L439422 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ So are you. You've got a vision.
L439421 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
L439420 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
L439419 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I came to say goodbye.
L439287 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
L439286 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
L439285 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
L439284 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ What's the matter?
L439171 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.
L439170 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.
L439169 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?
L439168 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
L439167 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
L439166 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
L439165 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
L439164 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ One... two... three.  You are now awake.
L439163 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I couldn't help it —— I loved him.
L439162 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad.  Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it.
L439160 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Yes, every day.  Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.
L439159 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Will you take of f your blouse?
L439158 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
L439157 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
L439156 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
L439155 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
L439154 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...
L439153 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Silicon is from sand.
L439152 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
L439151 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ What will they be made of?
L439150 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
L439149 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
L439148 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
L439147 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three.  We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
L439146 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
L439145 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
L439144 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
L439143 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ What do you know about hypnosis?
L439142 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
L439141 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Like what?
L439140 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
L439139 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
L439138 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
L439137 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
L439136 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
L439135 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
L439134 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
L439133 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
L439132 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ What are you doing?
L439131 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Hi, Richard.
L439020 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ High tech. I like the sound of that.
L439019 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
L439018 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L439017 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful?
L439015 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Oh.	And huge portable radios. Everything else gets small, but for some reason, portable radios get enormous.
L439014 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
L439013 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ You don't have to use pig Latin! Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about.
L439010 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Not for you. Okay, there's lots more.
L439009 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
L439008 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and life—styles.
L439007 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Come on. You can't be serious.
L439006 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
L439000 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ When do we start?
L438999 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ You're taking advantage of a minor.
L438996 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Sixty—forty.
L438995 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fifty—fifty.
L438994 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Wbat're you talking about?
L438993 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
L438992 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Give me some credit, will you?
L438991 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
L438990 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
L438989 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...
L438988 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Richard, take it easy.
L438987 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
L438986 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
L438985 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
L438984 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
L438983 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
L438790 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ What if you're not here tomorrow?
L438789 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. 
L438788 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
L438787 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
L438786 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. Maybe you've just got powers of precognition. Well, maybe you're just out of whack.
L438783 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
L438782 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
L438779 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.
L438778 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ What're you doing?
L438777 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ There's one way to find out.
L438776 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Am I dead or not?
L438775 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ You're giving me the creeps.
L438774 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
L438773 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ You look pretty good for a corpse.
L438772 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
L438771 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
L438770 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I don't know.
L438769 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
L438768 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule!
L438767 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
L438766 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ How, did you know about my grandfather?
L438765 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.
L438762 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ You probably are crazy. Wait a minute. Is this some kind of joke? I know what you all, think of me.
L438761 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
L438760 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Okay. I promise.
L438759 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
L438758 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
L438757 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ So you think time travel is possible? For people?
L438756 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
L438755 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ What's inside?
L438754 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
L438753 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I	know what a burrito is.
L438752 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
L438751 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ What's that?
L438750 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ And then, there's Richard's Burrito.
L438749 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.
L438748 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Sort of.
L438747 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Are you doing some kind of science project?
L438746 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
L438745 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
L438744 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ What a great kite.
L438729 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it four—thirty. I have a rocket club meeting.
L438728 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
L438727 +++$+++ u7026 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
