L600516 +++$+++ u3269 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DETECTIVE CAVALLO +++$+++ So you admit it?
L600515 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
L600920 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Just one pair! You owe me that much, you heartless bitch!
L600919 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Stop it!
L600918 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
L600917 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ ...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
L600916 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
L600915 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm asking you to leave.
L600911 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ All right, I did, but I was in a weird place then.
L600910 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
L600909 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.
L600906 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're better -- you seem... good --but... you put me through quite an ordeal, you know.
L600905 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
L600904 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
L600903 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
L600902 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You sent that?
L600901 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?
L600937 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ If you're so happy with them, please, be my guest.
L600936 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
L600935 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Dom Wooganowski. Duh.
L600932 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ You stole her from me. Now I want her back.
L600931 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Dom? What are you?
L600736 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ People get hurt that way.
L600735 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
L600734 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
L600733 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Jesus Christ you're right.
L600732 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
L600731 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Huh.
L600730 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck with your head, that stuff will.
L600729 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'm usually too tired to be.
L600728 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Why's that?
L600727 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ No.
L600726 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?
L600724 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ You jerk off before all big dates, right? Tell me you jerk off before your big dates.
L600723 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Pipes? What are you talking about?
L600722 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ You know, clean the pipes.
L600721 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Hm?
L600720 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go.
L600719 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Copped a tin of Altoids at the car wash.
L600718 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Mints?
L600717 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Check.
L600716 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Car clean? Plenty of gas?
L600715 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Got cash.
L600714 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
L600713 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know if I'm ready for this, man.
L600633 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.  She's even more beautiful than I remember.
L600632 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
L600631 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I don't know what to say.
L600630 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Well? What are you waiting for?
L600612 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
L600611 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Fuck me.  Let's go home.
L600566 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Don't you see? -- Healy lied to us about everything! The landlord said when he got back from Miami he kept talking about falling for some doctor named Mary!
L600565 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ And this adversely affects me how...?
L600564 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
L600563 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Shoot.
L600561 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Flew.  Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention.
L600560 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ How the hell did you get here anyway?
L600559 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Yeah feels like it.
L600558 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
L600557 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I am?
L600556 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that?
L600356 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
L600355 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Well then you've got to call her, man.
L600354 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.
L600353 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
L600352 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L600351 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ No You mean...?
L600350 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Well think about it.
L600349 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Huh? But why did Healy?
L600348 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
L600347 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ What?
L600346 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Mary's a babe!
L600275 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Amen to that.
L600274 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
L600273 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Never met him.
L600272 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
L600271 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health...  I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.
L600270 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away.
L600269 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Wait a second, I never told you that.
L600268 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ I'm sorry, it's just that you're taking this all wrong, pal. Don't you see? You're liberated. I feel liberated. I mean here you've been in therapy thinking you blew it with the greatest girl ever, and it turns out that getting your dick stuck in your zipper was the best thing that ever happened to you!
L600267 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What's so funny?
L600266 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I think it was better when I didn't. It was kind of inspiring to know there was someone so pure in the world.
L600265 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Well... at least now you know.
L600264 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
L600263 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Hey, look on the bright side --
L600262 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That's it, I'm making an oath. I'll never procrastinate about anything again. Life is too fucking short.
L600080 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ He'll do better than that. I'll send him down to Miami on business, you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her down.
L600079 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ And you think he could find out her number for me?
L600078 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
L600077 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ His mother?
L600076 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
L600075 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I don't know about this, Dom.
L600072 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ I got it -- you hire a private eye, fly him out there, he follows her around a couple days, she'll never know a thing.
L600071 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
L600070 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ You're kidding? What did they say?
L600069 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
L600068 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
L600067 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
L600066 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
L600065 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
L600064 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Why not?
L600063 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Yeah, right.
L600062 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Well why don't you look her up?
L600061 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I don't know.
L600060 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ I mean since then.
L600059 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I told you, her family moved to Miami.
L600058 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Whatever happened to Mary?
L600057 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
L600056 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Mary again.
L600055 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Well once. Mary.
L600054 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Never?
L600053 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Nah.
L600052 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
L600051 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It must be great with a wife like that.
L600043 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ I never said that. I'm saying your lucky those kids found his kidneys.  Besides, your brother Jimmy never gave a shit about you.
L600042 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
L600041 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one in a million?
L600040 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Loser? You?
L600039 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm in a slump.  Lately I've been feeling like... well... like a loser.
L600038 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ I just told you, she's half Asian. half American. They're all good looking. You could mate Don Rickles and Yoko Ono and they're going to have a gorgeous kid. It's a foolproof combo.
L600037 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Good-looking?
L600036 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.  You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.
L600035 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What's he like?
L600034 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
L600033 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
L600032 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Let me ask you this: When you smoke a cigar, do you ever pretend it has balls?
L600031 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Yeah, but he was successful.
L600030 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
L600029 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ He implied it.
L600028 +++$+++ u3270 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DOM +++$+++ Gay? He said you were gay?
L600343 +++$+++ u3271 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DR. LALONDE +++$+++ I'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon.
L600342 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ A convention? How'd you see her at a convention?
L600341 +++$+++ u3271 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DR. LALONDE +++$+++ From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas.
L600340 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Mary.
L600339 +++$+++ u3271 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DR. LALONDE +++$+++ Who?
L600338 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Bob, do you remember Mary?
L600336 +++$+++ u3271 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DR. LALONDE +++$+++ Yeah, that's more or less what the others said, too. Out getting coffee... supposed to meet him here... picking up my grandma...
L600335 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Out getting coffee.
L600334 +++$+++ u3271 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DR. LALONDE +++$+++ Uh-huh. Where was he?
L600333 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
L600332 +++$+++ u3271 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ DR. LALONDE +++$+++ So... I see you made the news.
L599927 +++$+++ u3272 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ FRIEND #1 +++$+++ Because you're a loser, and in some warped way this gives you a momentary sense of worth.
L599926 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Oh come on, why would I lie?
L599925 +++$+++ u3272 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ FRIEND #1 +++$+++ I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.
L599870 +++$+++ u3272 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ FRIEND #1 +++$+++ Loser? Woogie was all-state football and and basketball and valedictorian of his class.
L599869 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like a loser.
L599868 +++$+++ u3272 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ FRIEND #1 +++$+++ Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.
L599867 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Who?
L599861 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Who?
L599860 +++$+++ u3272 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ FRIEND #1 +++$+++ Why don't you be a gentleman and ask Rosey?
L600926 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place.
L600925 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ We're in love with your roommate.
L600385 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ No, thanks.  Love a little bundt cake if you have some!
L600384 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?
L600379 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ You got a brew?
L600378 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ Would you like a glass of tea or something?
L600377 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals...  ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'
L600376 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
L600375 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ 'That right?
L600374 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ You mean he doesn't like bad guys.
L600207 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Call you back.
L600206 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his partner's all lubed up.
L600607 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ You said it, mister.  I gotta go.
L600606 +++$+++ u3282 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ SULLY +++$+++ Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
L600605 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did.  I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better.
L600599 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Ahh.
L600598 +++$+++ u3282 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ SULLY +++$+++ But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
L600597 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.
L600596 +++$+++ u3282 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ SULLY +++$+++ Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
L600592 +++$+++ u3282 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ SULLY +++$+++ Dumbshit.
L600591 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Oh yeah.
L600586 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Yep.
L600585 +++$+++ u3282 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ SULLY +++$+++ The sawbones?
L600584 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
L600583 +++$+++ u3282 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ SULLY +++$+++ So where the hell are you, Healy?
L600201 +++$+++ u3282 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ SULLY +++$+++ You found my car?!
L600200 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.
L600198 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Sully, it's Healy. What's going on over there?
L600197 +++$+++ u3282 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ SULLY +++$+++ Who the fuck is it to you?
L600196 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Hello...? Sully...?  Sully, that you?
L600138 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
L600137 +++$+++ u3282 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ SULLY +++$+++ Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
L600136 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Bet your ass you are. Now I don't want to hear anymore of your happy horseshit. You gotta learn how to bend a little or believe me... you're gonna break.
L600135 +++$+++ u3282 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ SULLY +++$+++ Am I?
L600134 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
L600132 +++$+++ u3282 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ SULLY +++$+++ No I can't.
L600131 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
L600130 +++$+++ u3282 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ SULLY +++$+++ Healy, what I just tell you?
L600129 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Here, just have one of these then.
L600128 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you.
L600127 +++$+++ u3282 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ SULLY +++$+++ Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
L600126 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
L600125 +++$+++ u3282 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ SULLY +++$+++ Nineteen months I been sober.
L600124 +++$+++ u3282 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ SULLY +++$+++ Relax, he just ate.
L600123 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
L600122 +++$+++ u3282 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ SULLY +++$+++ Take it easy, that's Bill.
L600120 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?
L600119 +++$+++ u3282 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ SULLY +++$+++ Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
L600118 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
L600117 +++$+++ u3282 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ SULLY +++$+++ What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
