L198196 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ I'm gonna miss you.
L198195 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Storage.
L198194 +++$+++ u5153 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Phonograph.
L198193 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ What is it?
L198192 +++$+++ u5153 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Where do you want this?
L197863 +++$+++ u5153 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Of course I didn't.
L197862 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?
L197765 +++$+++ u5153 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ I can't believe it.
L197764 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Oh Burke! Poor Burke!
L197755 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ We have to start looking for a shrink.
L197754 +++$+++ u5153 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ What did the doctor say?
L197753 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Yeah, well I guess you should've.
L197752 +++$+++ u5153 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Well, when I went to get the Thorazine I had him to stay with her and... Oh, I should of known better.
L197751 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ What's Burke got to do with it?
L197750 +++$+++ u5153 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Burke.
L197749 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Didn't who tell me?
L197748 +++$+++ u5153 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ What didn't he tell you?
L197747 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her self! What are you kidding her window's wide open...
L197554 +++$+++ u5153 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Why don't you let me?
L197553 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
L197552 +++$+++ u5153 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Maybe the circuit is busy?
L197551 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
L197433 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ No kidding.
L197432 +++$+++ u5153 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Just five or six people.
L197431 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
L197430 +++$+++ u5153 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Dinner at the White House.
L197429 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ What's this?
L197428 +++$+++ u5153 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ And you got an invitation.
L197427 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Oh great, anything else?
L197426 +++$+++ u5153 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Here.
L197424 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Oh not to bad, kinda like the Walt Disney version of the Ho Chi Minh story, but other than that it was terrific.
L197423 +++$+++ u5153 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Hi, how'd your day go?
L197422 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Hi
L197421 +++$+++ u5153 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ In here!
L197420 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Hello?
L197905 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ You're a nice man.
L197904 +++$+++ u5145 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KINDERMAN +++$+++ Thank you.
L197902 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Really? wow.
L197901 +++$+++ u5145 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KINDERMAN +++$+++ I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times.
L197900 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ What's her name?
L197899 +++$+++ u5145 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KINDERMAN +++$+++ Oh, she'd love it.
L197898 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Of course. Have you got a pen?
L197897 +++$+++ u5145 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KINDERMAN +++$+++ I hate to ask you this but... for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph?
L197896 +++$+++ u5145 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KINDERMAN +++$+++ Couldn't hurt. In the meantime...
L197895 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ When she's well enough, I'll ask.
L197894 +++$+++ u5145 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KINDERMAN +++$+++ I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?
L197893 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
L197892 +++$+++ u5145 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KINDERMAN +++$+++ Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?
L197889 +++$+++ u5145 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KINDERMAN +++$+++ Please.
L197888 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Would you like some more coffee?
L197887 +++$+++ u5145 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KINDERMAN +++$+++ Never mind.
L197886 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Want to ask him?
L197885 +++$+++ u5145 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KINDERMAN +++$+++ Oh, I see.
L197884 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
L197883 +++$+++ u5145 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KINDERMAN +++$+++ Groceries maybe? A package?
L197882 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Not that I know of.
L197881 +++$+++ u5145 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KINDERMAN +++$+++ You were expecting a deliver y that day?
L197880 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ No. Not at all,
L197879 +++$+++ u5145 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KINDERMAN +++$+++ Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit, stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it's not likely he would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man: point one. And the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the various things I have mentioned, would make it very probable - probable, not certain - that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But no-one was here except your daughter. So how could this be? It could be one way: if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned. The servants, they have visitors?
L197875 +++$+++ u5145 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KINDERMAN +++$+++ Watch out for drafts. A draft in the fall when the house is hot is a magic carpet for bacteria.
L197874 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ We still don't know.
L197873 +++$+++ u5145 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KINDERMAN +++$+++ May I ask...?
L197872 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Yes, I'm affraid it is.
L197871 +++$+++ u5145 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KINDERMAN +++$+++ It's serious?
L197870 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ No, she was heavily sedated.
L197869 +++$+++ u5145 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KINDERMAN +++$+++ Does your daughter remember if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her room in her room that night?
L197877 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ No thanks Karl.
L197876 +++$+++ u5143 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?
L197868 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ What man?
L197867 +++$+++ u5143 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ A man to see you.
L197866 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ What!
L197865 +++$+++ u5143 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Excuse me Miss?
L197861 +++$+++ u5143 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ No. It wasn't me. I didn't.
L197860 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
L197859 +++$+++ u5143 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ She is going to be well?
L197858 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Karl? Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
L197633 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Karl!!
L197632 +++$+++ u5143 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Bastard! I will kill you.
L197563 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific.
L197562 +++$+++ u5143 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
L197561 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
L197560 +++$+++ u5143 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ There is nothing.
L197394 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Well don't go now Karl the stores aren't open yet.
L197393 +++$+++ u5143 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Yes, I go now.
L197392 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Yeah or maybe rats now will you just get those traps.
L197390 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ I just heard them Karl.
L197389 +++$+++ u5143 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ No. No rats.
L197388 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ All right then we've got clean rats.
L197387 +++$+++ u5143 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ But it's clean?
L197386 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
L197385 +++$+++ u5143 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Rats?
L197384 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.
L197383 +++$+++ u5143 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Good morning Madame.
L197655 +++$+++ u5155 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ Yes, I think so.
L197654 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Is it coming out Willie?
L197381 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ That's good.
L197380 +++$+++ u5155 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ Fine thank you.
L197379 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ How are you today?
L197378 +++$+++ u5155 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
L197377 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Morning.
L197741 +++$+++ u5140 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ DR. KLEIN +++$+++ I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.
L197740 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
L197739 +++$+++ u5140 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ DR. KLEIN +++$+++ Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.
L197738 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
L197737 +++$+++ u5140 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ DR. KLEIN +++$+++ Are you sure?
L197736 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ No. Of course not, nothing like that.
L197735 +++$+++ u5140 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ DR. KLEIN +++$+++ Do you keep any drugs in your house?
L197728 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Oh. What are you talking about for Christ sake! Did you see her or not? She's acting like a fucking out of her mind psychotic or a split personality or...
L197727 +++$+++ u5140 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ DR. KLEIN +++$+++ We still think the temporal lobe...
L197724 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
L197723 +++$+++ u5140 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ DR. KLEIN +++$+++ She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.
L197687 +++$+++ u5140 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ DR. KLEIN +++$+++ Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar.
L197686 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
L197685 +++$+++ u5140 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ DR. KLEIN +++$+++ The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour.
L197684 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
L197683 +++$+++ u5140 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ DR. KLEIN +++$+++ Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
L197682 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ So, what causes this?
L197681 +++$+++ u5140 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ DR. KLEIN +++$+++ Mrs. MacNeil the problem with your daughter is not her bed, it's her brain.
L197680 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
L197679 +++$+++ u5140 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ DR. KLEIN +++$+++ The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
L197678 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Convulsion?
L197677 +++$+++ u5140 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ DR. KLEIN +++$+++ Well, It's a symptom of a type of desturbance in the chemico- electrical activity of the brain. In the case of your daughter in the temperal lobe, up here in the lateral part of the brain. It's rare, but it does cause bizarre hallucinations and usually just before a convulsion.
L197613 +++$+++ u5140 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ DR. KLEIN +++$+++ The best explanation is always the simplest one. Let's wait. Let's wait and see. In the meantime try not to worry.
L197612 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
L197611 +++$+++ u5140 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ DR. KLEIN +++$+++ She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
L197610 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ She used those words?
L197609 +++$+++ u5140 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ DR. KLEIN +++$+++ Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
L197608 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Hey, come on, I'm grown-up. What'd she say? I mean specifically, Doctor.
L197607 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!
L197606 +++$+++ u5140 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ DR. KLEIN +++$+++ Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
L197605 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ You're kidding! Like what?
L197604 +++$+++ u5140 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ DR. KLEIN +++$+++ Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.
L197603 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
L197602 +++$+++ u5140 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ DR. KLEIN +++$+++ Well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-
L197601 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Never.
L197600 +++$+++ u5140 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ DR. KLEIN +++$+++ Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
L197599 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
L197598 +++$+++ u5140 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ DR. KLEIN +++$+++ Lies?
L197597 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ And those lies she's been telling?
L197596 +++$+++ u5140 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ DR. KLEIN +++$+++ Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.
L197595 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
L197594 +++$+++ u5140 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ DR. KLEIN +++$+++ Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
L197593 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Depression?
L197592 +++$+++ u5140 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ DR. KLEIN +++$+++ Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
L197591 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
L197590 +++$+++ u5140 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ DR. KLEIN +++$+++ A stimulant.
L197589 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ What is it? A tranquilizer?
L197588 +++$+++ u5140 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ DR. KLEIN +++$+++ Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.
L197587 +++$+++ u5140 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ DR. KLEIN +++$+++ It affects concentration.
L197586 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Why the math?
L197585 +++$+++ u5140 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ DR. KLEIN +++$+++ A disorder of the nerves. At least we think it is. We don't know yet exactly how it works, but it's often seen in earl adolescence. She shows all the symptoms: the hyperactivity; the temper; her performance in math.
L198184 +++$+++ u5144 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARRAS +++$+++ No.
L198183 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Is she gonna die?
L198089 +++$+++ u5144 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARRAS +++$+++ Father?
L198088 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Yes. He's already here.
L198051 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ She killed Burke Dennings. She pushed him out of the window.
L198050 +++$+++ u5144 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARRAS +++$+++ What?
L198049 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ She...killed Burke Dennings.
L198048 +++$+++ u5144 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARRAS +++$+++ Holy water's blessed. And that doesn't help support a case for possession.
L198047 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ What's the difference?
L198046 +++$+++ u5144 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARRAS +++$+++ I told Regan that was holy water, I sprinkled some on her and she reacted very violently. It's tap water.
L198045 +++$+++ u5144 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARRAS +++$+++ Well I think you should.
L198044 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ No
L198043 +++$+++ u5144 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARRAS +++$+++ Have you told him what's happening?
L198042 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ In Europe.
L198041 +++$+++ u5144 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARRAS +++$+++ Where's Regan's father?
L198040 +++$+++ u5144 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARRAS +++$+++ It's fine really, sit.
L198039 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Are you sure?
L198038 +++$+++ u5144 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARRAS +++$+++ No it's alright I'll take it straight.
L198035 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ What do you drink?
L198034 +++$+++ u5144 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARRAS +++$+++ Please.
L198033 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Wanna drink.
L198001 +++$+++ u5144 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARRAS +++$+++ It's not important good night.
L198000 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Not at all. Why d'you ask?
L197999 +++$+++ u5144 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARRAS +++$+++ No, is Regan aware of it?
L197998 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Yes I did, I'm sorry.
L197997 +++$+++ u5144 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARRAS +++$+++ Did you know my mother died recently?
L197996 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ No.
L197995 +++$+++ u5144 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARRAS +++$+++ Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
L197994 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ You show me Regan's double: same face, same voice, same everything. I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut and I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter! And I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!
L197993 +++$+++ u5144 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARRAS +++$+++ There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
L197992 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
L197991 +++$+++ u5144 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARRAS +++$+++ I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
L197990 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ What else?
L197989 +++$+++ u5144 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARRAS +++$+++ Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
L197988 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Like what?
L197987 +++$+++ u5144 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARRAS +++$+++ I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
L197986 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
L197985 +++$+++ u5144 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARRAS +++$+++ Thanks. Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good.
L197968 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Oh, will you help her! Just help her!
L197967 +++$+++ u5144 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARRAS +++$+++ No, you don't understand. Your daughter-
L197966 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
L197965 +++$+++ u5144 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARRAS +++$+++ Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
L197964 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Could you see her?
L197963 +++$+++ u5144 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARRAS +++$+++ No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
L197962 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ You could do it yourself...
L197961 +++$+++ u5144 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARRAS +++$+++ Well before the church approves an exorcism, it conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. In the meantime...
L197960 +++$+++ u5138 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ But how?
L197959 +++$+++ u5144 +++$+++ m341 +++$+++ KARRAS +++$+++ To begin with it could make things worse.
