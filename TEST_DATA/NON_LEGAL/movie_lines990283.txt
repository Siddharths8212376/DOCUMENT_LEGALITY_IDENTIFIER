L499414 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet?
L499413 +++$+++ u7571 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA AS THOMAS +++$+++ No, sir.
L499412 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Do you understand me?

L499263 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Take off your hat.
L499260 +++$+++ u7571 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA AS THOMAS +++$+++ Thomas Kent. I would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player.

L499797 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You are on my ground.
L499796 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ You upstart inky pup! Now I will show you your place, which is in hell!
L499642 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ That dog!
L499641 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
L499640 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
L499639 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ A theatre poet?
L499638 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
L499637 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ A man, my lord?
L499636 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ Is there a man?
L499632 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Oh, my lord, you will not shake me off, she never needed me more, I sear by your breeches!
L499631 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
L499630 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.  My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
L499629 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ Are you bringing your laundry woman?
L499628 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Here we come at last, my lord!
L499326 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Christopher Marlowe at your service.
L499325 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
L499324 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ How do I offend, my lord?
L499323 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.
L499322 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ "Poet?"
L500709 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Your idea? Well, that fits. I mean, the two of you, that fits together. I should have seen that long ago.
L500708 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
L500707 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What?
L500697 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Where will we go? Where will we go? Juliet?
L500696 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Where do you think you'll go?
L500695 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ It's very kind of you to offer, but --
L500694 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ About the mail --
L500693 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No, can't think of anything else that matters.
L500689 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ But more laughter than tears, I think? Yes. On balance? I mean, remember that time when -- oh, we could talk all night, but we have to go. Don't we, Juliet?
L500688 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yeah?
L500687 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?
L500686 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Not at all.
L500685 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer.
L500684 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Oh, no, no, no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best.
L500683 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.
L500682 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
L500681 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
L500680 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ So I gathered.
L500679 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
L500678 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
L500677 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.
L500668 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Except the money.
L500667 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
L500666 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ They know.
L500665 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --
L500664 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ But they know.
L500594 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L500593 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
L500592 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
L500591 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.
L500557 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.
L500556 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Your friends.
L500555 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Who?
L500553 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ We just wanted to speak to you.
L500552 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
L500551 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Looking for you? Yes.
L500550 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You looking for me?
L500438 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
L500437 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I want to secure it.
L500429 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ If you give me the plate, I'll eat.
L500428 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Not eating like you used to, that's what.
L500427 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Not eating what?
L500426 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You're not eating.
L500425 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Nothing.
L500424 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What's wrong?
L500423 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
L500422 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You're sure? There's lots more.
L500421 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What? Yes, that's fine.
L500415 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Oh, that'll come in useful.
L500414 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
L500413 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What's all this for, more security?
L500412 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me.
L500411 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Doesn't it worry you?
L500410 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Downstairs, I know. Pensioner's terror ordeal: page six.
L500409 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ There was a break-in.
L500408 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
L500407 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Security.
L500406 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What is this?
L500396 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I don't know.
L500395 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ How much?
L500394 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I don't know.
L500393 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ How much did you pay?
L500392 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I don't know.
L500391 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ How much did you pay?
L500376 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You think so?
L500375 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the full there.
L500362 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --
L500361 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?
L500349 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ After.
L500348 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Now.
L500347 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ After you drink to love and happiness forever.
L500346 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I want to talk now.
L500345 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What's the problem?
L500342 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Just stop worrying.
L500341 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --
L500340 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Not now. I have an idea.
L500339 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Can we talk about something?
L500338 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ That was good.
L500316 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
L500315 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Is this necessary?
L500314 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Don't you worry about that.
L500313 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Is that going to be deep enough?
L500312 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ But not quite.
L500311 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Finished.
L500308 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
L500307 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I don't know.
L500301 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Take his legs.
L500300 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I just thought we should discuss it.
L500299 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Family? Family? Friends? Drugged-up wandering suicidal search of the self fuck-ups don't have families, David.
L500290 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm just telling you I can't cut him up.
L500289 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
L500288 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I won't be able to.
L500287 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I don't hear this.
L500286 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I can't do it.
L500285 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
L500284 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You know what. Who's going to do it.
L500283 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
L500282 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You know what I'm talking about.
L500281 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Then what? Who's going to do what?
L500280 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No, not that.
L500279 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Dig the pit, I don't know.
L500278 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ So who's going to do it?
L500277 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.
L500276 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Now what else? DAVID I don't know.
L500270 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ And what about you?
L500269 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You call them if you want.
L500268 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ When are you going to let the police know?
L500267 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ He couldn't get his car started.
L500266 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ He's still here.
L500232 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it.
L500231 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You think so?
L500230 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
L500229 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
L500228 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I'm only asking you both to think about it.
L500227 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You mean immoral.
L500222 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Juliet?
L500221 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No.
L500220 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Come on, David.
L500219 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No.
L500218 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Think about it.
L500217 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No.
L500215 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Can I show you something?
L500214 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time.
L500172 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No.
L500171 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
L500170 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Alex, I don't have the time --
L500169 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Have you seen him?
L500168 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No, she's not in. Without waiting for any more, he replaces the reciever and walks to the door, where he picks up the mail. On his way back from the door, David emerges, ready to go to work.
L500144 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...
L500143 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Only on expenses.
L500139 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Why, thank you, David.
L500138 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ He made it clear.
L500114 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
L500113 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I'm only asking what you think.
L500112 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I don't have time.
L500111 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ About this guy, this Hugo person.
L500110 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ About what?
L500109 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What do you think?
L500049 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Discussion group, Alex, discussion.
L500048 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
L500047 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
L500046 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win.
L500041 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I haven't lost yet.
L500040 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You're a bad loser.
L500039 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Will you shut up and play.
L500038 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Chess. Chess is often used as well.
L500037 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What?
L500036 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ In the same fashion as chess.
L500035 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Just serve.
L500034 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I was trying to educate you.
L500033 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Serve.
L500032 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
L500026 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?
