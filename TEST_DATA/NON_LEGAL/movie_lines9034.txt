L168754 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Fuck them.
L168753 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
L168752 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Don't look so freaked.
L168751 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Sure.
L168750 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Wanna walk me home?
L168749 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ School's cancelled.
L168748 +++$+++ u785 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ GRETCHEN +++$+++ Hey...
L168747 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Hey...
L168895 +++$+++ u788 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. FARMER +++$+++ If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
L168894 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ People aren't that simple.
L168893 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Well, yeah... OK, but you're not listening to me. There are other things that need to be taken into account here. Like the whole spectrum of human emotion. You're just lumping everything into these two categories... and, like, denying everything else.
L168892 +++$+++ u788 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. FARMER +++$+++ Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
L168891 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
L168890 +++$+++ u788 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. FARMER +++$+++ The Lifeline is divided that way.
L168889 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
L168888 +++$+++ u788 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. FARMER +++$+++ Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
L168887 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.
L169159 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ It feels wonderful.
L169158 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
L169157 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
L169156 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Do you get to meet Ed?
L169155 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.
L169063 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.
L169062 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?
L168922 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ That is a terrible nickname.
L168921 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Grandma Death.
L168599 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?
L168598 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
L168597 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
L168596 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
L168588 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
L168587 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
L168583 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ When did you stop taking your medication?
L168582 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ You're such a fuck-ass.
L168571 +++$+++ u792 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
L168570 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
L169105 +++$+++ u782 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I know I'm not the best... communicator.  But whatever happens in your life... whatever obstacles you come up against... you just say... and do whatever is in your heart. You be honest... and tell the truth... even if they look at you funny... and they will. They'll tell you that you're wrong. They'll call you a fool.  But what you've got to understand, son, is that almost all of those people are full of bullshit... and they're scared of people like you. Because you're smarter than all of them.
L169104 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I know, Dad.
L169103 +++$+++ u782 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You're my only son...
L169102 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
L169101 +++$+++ u782 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Who's been giving you weird looks?
L168927 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I guess she just lost faith in the world.
L168926 +++$+++ u782 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.
L168924 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day.
L168923 +++$+++ u782 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Grandma Death.
L168685 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Grandma Death.
L168684 +++$+++ u782 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Oh, shit!
L168683 +++$+++ u782 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.
L168682 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
L168681 +++$+++ u782 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
L168680 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Where it came from?
L168679 +++$+++ u782 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Know what?
L168678 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Do they know yet?
L168677 +++$+++ u782 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
L168676 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
L168675 +++$+++ u782 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ So how was school today?
L169185 +++$+++ u789 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. POMEROY +++$+++ Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away.  She was right about the rabbits. Go.
L169184 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
L169183 +++$+++ u789 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. POMEROY +++$+++ So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
L169182 +++$+++ u789 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. POMEROY +++$+++ Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
L169181 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Cellar door.
L169180 +++$+++ u789 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. POMEROY +++$+++ A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that "Cellar Door" is the most beautiful.
L169179 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ What's "Cellar Door"?
L169178 +++$+++ u789 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. POMEROY +++$+++ Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.
L169177 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
L169176 +++$+++ u789 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. POMEROY +++$+++ Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
L169175 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
L169174 +++$+++ u789 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. POMEROY +++$+++ I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
L169173 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Where are you going?
L169172 +++$+++ u789 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. POMEROY +++$+++ Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
L169171 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
L169136 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.
L169135 +++$+++ u789 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. POMEROY +++$+++ Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
L169134 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
L169133 +++$+++ u789 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. POMEROY +++$+++ Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
L169132 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Why should we care?
L169131 +++$+++ u789 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. POMEROY +++$+++ And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.
L168877 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
L168876 +++$+++ u789 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. POMEROY +++$+++ Who is Frank?
L168668 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
L168667 +++$+++ u789 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ MS. POMEROY +++$+++ Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?
L169241 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ Goodbye, Donald.
L169240 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
L169239 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
L169238 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Thank you.
L169237 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water.
L169235 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you.  And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up.
L169234 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
L169233 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
L169232 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
L169231 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ Where is he, Donald?
L169230 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I can see him right now!
L169228 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ Who is he going to kill?
L169227 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Frank is going to kill.
L169226 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ What is going to happen?
L169224 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Soon. Time is almost up.
L169223 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ When will this happen?
L169222 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
L169221 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ Then how is time travel possible?
L169220 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
L169219 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ How is that possible?
L169218 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I have the power to build a time machine.
L169217 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ Where are we going, Donald?
L169216 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ Where are we going?
L169215 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
L169214 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ God exists because you're horny.
L169213 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Because I'm so horny.
L169212 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ Why?
L169211 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I think now that he might...
L169210 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ If God exists?
L169209 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
L169208 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?
L169207 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
L169206 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ You've done it again?
L169205 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ That I did it again.
L169204 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ What else makes you feel regret?
L169203 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Regret.
L169202 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
L169201 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Hungry Hungry Hippos.
L169200 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ What did you want for Christmas that year?
L169199 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
L169198 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
L169197 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Yes. I went to jail.
L169196 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ But you were punished.
L169195 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
L169194 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
L169193 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ People get hurt.
L169192 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ Is it Frank who wants you to destroy the world, to set the world on fire?
L169191 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I... I was playing with fire.
L169190 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
L169189 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Yes.
L169188 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
L169060 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ Have you ever made love, Donald?
L169059 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
L169058 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ The good stuff.
L169057 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
L169056 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ I know.
L169055 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Whoa.  That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.
L169053 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ You know... every week I come in here and I tell you stuff... and it's all embarrassing. I tell you stuff that I don't tell anyone else... and you know what? It's your turn, Dr. Thurman. I'm not saying anything else until you tell me something embarrassing about yourself.
L169052 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
L169051 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
L169050 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
L169049 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Nothing.
L169048 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ What did you find?
L169047 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
L169046 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ And they grow out of our stomachs?
L168942 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ No. That makes you keep searching.
L168941 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?
L168940 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ Do you feel alone right now?
L168939 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
L168938 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ Is Callie still around?
L168937 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ It reminded me of my dog Callie.
L168936 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ How does that make you feel?
L168935 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
L168934 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ A sign from whom?
L168933 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
L168932 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
L168931 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
L168930 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ Can anyone else see him?
L168929 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Four times... so far.
L168928 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ How many times have you seen Frank?
L168802 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.
L168801 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
L168800 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ What about your family, Donnie?
L168799 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
L168798 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ Who is the boss?
L168797 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"

L168689 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
L168688 +++$+++ u781 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DR. THURMAN +++$+++ Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
L169246 +++$+++ u779 +++$+++ m50 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Everything is going to be just fine.
