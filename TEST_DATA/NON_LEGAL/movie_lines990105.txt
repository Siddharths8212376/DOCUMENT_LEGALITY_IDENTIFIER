L369359 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Why does it feel good?
L369358 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
L369357 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I don't believe in God.
L369356 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ When you were so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death, it wasn't the act that got you down. Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?  And why shouldn't it feel good?! It must feel good to God. God does it all the time!
L369355 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Fight what?
L369354 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us.  Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?
L369353 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
L369352 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
L369351 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ What do you want?
L369350 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you are, Will.
L368830 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file.
L368829 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ Do you know how you caught me, Will?
L368828 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No.
L368827 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ I'll study it, Will. When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too. You can call me. When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone. Would you like to give me your home number?
L368826 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I haven't decided yet.
L368825 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ May I keep the file?
L368824 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
L368823 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ I don't have one right now.
L368822 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I want your opinion.
L368821 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?
L368820 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes. I'd considered it.
L368819 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
L368818 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ That's interesting.
L368817 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
L368816 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
L368815 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ What were the yards like?
L368812 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
L368811 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
L368810 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ Do you dream much, Will?
L368809 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No.
L368808 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ Let me have them, and I might consider it.
L368807 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes.
L368806 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ Pictures?
L368805 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes.
L368804 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ Do you have the file with you
L368803 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...
L368802 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
L368800 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ You're very tan, Will.
L368799 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ You're insane.
L368798 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ What disadvantage?
L368797 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ You had disadvantages.
L368796 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ Then how did you catch me, Will?
L368795 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are.
L368794 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me.
L368793 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
L368792 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ Pray tell.
L368791 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
L368790 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground.  I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face.  Never mind, it's boring.
L368789 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
L368788 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ Why should I tell you?
L368787 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I thought you would have some ideas.
L368786 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
L368785 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ You read about it, I'm sure.
L368784 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ Yes.
L368783 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
L368782 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ Yes, I thought so.
L368781 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
L368780 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ It doesn't matter to me, Will.
L368779 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
L368778 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
L368777 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ You've read the transcript. It's all there.
L368776 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ A layman..., layman. Interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say you're a 'layman?' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know how you did it'
L368775 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Very interesting, even to a layman.
L368774 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ And?
L368773 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
L368772 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ Of course, you don't.  I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.
L368771 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No.
L368770 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?
L368769 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Stuart is fine.
L368768 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement.
L368767 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I got it. Thank you.
L368766 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ Did you get my card?
L368765 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I keep getting it for Christmas.
L368764 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
L369151 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Let's walk the route.
L369150 +++$+++ u6497 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ SPURGEN +++$+++ You got it.
L369149 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
L369148 +++$+++ u6497 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ SPURGEN +++$+++ I hope you have a second chance...
L369147 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Kevlar Second Chance.
L369146 +++$+++ u6497 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ SPURGEN +++$+++ ...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
L369145 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Glaser Safety Slugs?
L369144 +++$+++ u6497 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ SPURGEN +++$+++ Good. You'll load these, Ever fire them?
L369143 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes.
L369142 +++$+++ u6497 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ SPURGEN +++$+++ I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
L369141 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Pretty well.
L369140 +++$+++ u6497 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ SPURGEN +++$+++ ...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear?
L370302 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Yeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing!  He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!
L370301 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Really?
L370300 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
L370299 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
L370295 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah...
L370294 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ My hair is coming out.
L370293 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You've got good days and bad days.
L370292 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I can't move my arm.
L370257 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Then he'll borrow it.  I know Tony better than you do.  Even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off, he'll do it!
L370256 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
L370255 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Tony Clifton.
L370254 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ So who's gonna pay for it?
L370253 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
L370241 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!  Carnegie Hall...!
L370240 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Do you wanna tour the clubs?
L370239 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
L370238 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ So how can I help you...?
L370237 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Y-yeah?  Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead.
L370236 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Andy, you're surrounded by what you create.  You are the KING of negative energy.
L370235 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Of course!  But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy.
L370234 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You must take a little pleasure in it.
L370231 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ It's visualization therapy.  He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.
L370230 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What was that all about?
L370197 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I -- I got some freaky rare kind. It's called large-celled carcinoma.
L370196 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
L370195 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.
L370184 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.
L370183 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...
L370159 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Andy... it's me.  I've got some crummy news.  Taxi's been canceled.
L370158 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Hey!  Our first phone call!  Hello?
L370134 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back.
L370133 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount...
L370127 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You're BLIND!  There is no envelope anymore!!  It hurts me to say this... but there's only one solution --  I don't want you two to ever work together again.
L370126 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ We were just trying to push the envelope --
L369999 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion.  He'll kill you.  First, you piss-off women.  Then you piss-off the South.  Then you get killed!  And I did the bookings.
L369998 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ What, you don't think I can beat him?
L369997 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Andy, do you realize you don't do comedy anymore?  Where's that sweet guy who used to do  "Here I come to save the day!"?  Please, enough with the wrestling! You've lost touch with reality!
L369941 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ That's because they've only seen it once.  But I'll do it again, and again, and AGAIN...  They'll catch on!
L369940 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
L369939 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ They're having a laugh...
L369938 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ No, I'm not gonna take it.  If I take it I'll break my back.
L369937 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ That means it was a success.  I woke up the audience -- like punk rock!  Here, take this.
L369914 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  It's obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the level anymore.
L369913 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do.  'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them.
L369908 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ "Funny"?  I dunno.  But "intriguing"... "mindboggling"... perhaps "headache-inducing"... sure.  Like, that moment, when you both came onstage...
L369907 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ But wasn't it funny?
L369906 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"
L369848 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ There'll be other shots.
L369847 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Oh dear!  George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break.
L369843 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Oh no!  Did he get hurt?
L369842 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.
L369841 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Oh, you know the Bay Area!  Always foggy!
L369840 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
L369839 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!
L369807 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't know!  Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself?
L369806 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ How long would they let me sleep?
L369805 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ And that's great.  But do it in LA and New York!  There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage!  I don't care!
L369804 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ But George, I like to push the boundaries...
L369803 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude.  If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!!
L369801 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!  And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!
L369800 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I'm sorry, George...
L369776 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Okay... I'll go back.  But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka.  They're gettin' Tony!
L369775 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You signed for five years --  So four years, seven months.
L369774 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Yeah, we can have a garage sale. "Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!"
L369773 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
L369772 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
L369771 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like --
L369711 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ What's up?
L369710 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Andy!
L369677 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ That's alright.  Where...?
L369676 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
L369675 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
L369674 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Hi George!
L369673 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Andy?
L369664 +++$+++ u6499 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to do impressions of him.  We sorta... got in a fight over that.
L369663 +++$+++ u6502 +++$+++ m432 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
