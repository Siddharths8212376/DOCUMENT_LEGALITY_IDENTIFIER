L535350 +++$+++ u2918 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What I have done, I had to do.
L535349 +++$+++ u2924 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ SAREK +++$+++ I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
L535348 +++$+++ u2918 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What about Spock?
L534842 +++$+++ u2924 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ SAREK +++$+++ You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you <U>must</U>.
L534841 +++$+++ u2918 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What you ask is difficult.
L534840 +++$+++ u2924 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ SAREK +++$+++ You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
L534839 +++$+++ u2918 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What must I do?
L534838 +++$+++ u2924 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ SAREK +++$+++ One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
L534837 +++$+++ u2918 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Bones!...
L534826 +++$+++ u2918 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Sarek!... What if he melded with someone else?!
L534825 +++$+++ u2924 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ SAREK +++$+++ Yes... But -- how...?
L534824 +++$+++ u2918 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!
L534823 +++$+++ u2924 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ SAREK +++$+++ I see... and I understand.  Then everything that he was... Everything that he knew... is lost. And when I return home empty-handed, many shall mourn.
L534822 +++$+++ u2918 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
L534821 +++$+++ u2924 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ SAREK +++$+++ Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
L534820 +++$+++ u2918 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ ... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
L534819 +++$+++ u2924 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ SAREK +++$+++ I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
L534818 +++$+++ u2918 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ ... Spock...
L534817 +++$+++ u2924 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ SAREK +++$+++ ... Or the one.
L534816 +++$+++ u2918 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ ... The needs of the few...
L534815 +++$+++ u2924 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ SAREK +++$+++ ... The needs of the many outweigh...
L534814 +++$+++ u2918 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ ... Yes...
L534813 +++$+++ u2924 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ SAREK +++$+++ He asked you not to grieve...
L534812 +++$+++ u2918 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes...
L534811 +++$+++ u2924 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ SAREK +++$+++ ... He spoke of your friendship.
L534810 +++$+++ u2918 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Of course...!
L534809 +++$+++ u2924 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ SAREK +++$+++ Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
L534808 +++$+++ u2918 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Then, how --
L534807 +++$+++ u2924 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ SAREK +++$+++ He would not have spoken of it openly.
L534806 +++$+++ u2918 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
L534805 +++$+++ u2924 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ SAREK +++$+++ Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
L534804 +++$+++ u2918 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But -- why?
L534803 +++$+++ u2924 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ SAREK +++$+++ Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
L534802 +++$+++ u2918 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, I was...
L534801 +++$+++ u2924 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ SAREK +++$+++ You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
L534800 +++$+++ u2918 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I -- saw no future --
L534799 +++$+++ u2924 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ SAREK +++$+++ "Met his death"?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
L534798 +++$+++ u2918 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
L534797 +++$+++ u2924 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ SAREK +++$+++ Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
L534796 +++$+++ u2918 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...
L534794 +++$+++ u2924 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ SAREK +++$+++ I will speak with you alone, Kirk.
L534793 +++$+++ u2918 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here...  I think you know my crew...
L535211 +++$+++ u2919 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KRUGE +++$+++ <U>We are Klingons</U>! Once you control the ship, I will transfer my flag there. And we will take Genesis from their own memory banks!
L535210 +++$+++ u2929 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ TORG +++$+++ They outnumber us, my Lord --
L535209 +++$+++ u2919 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KRUGE +++$+++ I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew.  Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!
L535184 +++$+++ u2919 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KRUGE +++$+++ I trust my instincts.  Admiral Kirk. This is your opponent speaking.
L535183 +++$+++ u2929 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ TORG +++$+++ How can you tell that?
L535176 +++$+++ u2919 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KRUGE +++$+++ They know we would die first.
L535175 +++$+++ u2929 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ TORG +++$+++ Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
L535174 +++$+++ u2919 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KRUGE +++$+++ Why haven't they finished us?... They outgun me ten to one; they have four hundred in crew to my handful, yet they sit there.
L535119 +++$+++ u2919 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KRUGE +++$+++ Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
L535118 +++$+++ u2929 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ TORG +++$+++ We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
L535108 +++$+++ u2929 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ TORG +++$+++ But sir! Federation Starship approaching.
L535107 +++$+++ u2919 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KRUGE +++$+++ I ordered no interruptions.
L534930 +++$+++ u2929 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ TORG +++$+++ I only meant, my lord, that if it's prisoners you want --  There are life signs on the planet. Perhaps the very scientists you seek.
L534929 +++$+++ u2919 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KRUGE +++$+++ Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
L534928 +++$+++ u2929 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ TORG +++$+++ Sir, may I suggest --
L534761 +++$+++ u2919 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KRUGE +++$+++ Station!
L534760 +++$+++ u2929 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ TORG +++$+++ Success, my lord.
L534759 +++$+++ u2919 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KRUGE +++$+++ We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
L534758 +++$+++ u2929 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ TORG +++$+++ Understood, my lord.
L534757 +++$+++ u2919 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KRUGE +++$+++ Share this with no one.
L534750 +++$+++ u2929 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ TORG +++$+++ Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
L534749 +++$+++ u2919 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KRUGE +++$+++ So!  Speak!
L535254 +++$+++ u2919 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KRUGE +++$+++ Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I...  That -- is the real dishonor.
L535253 +++$+++ u2921 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ MALTZ +++$+++ But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
L535252 +++$+++ u2919 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KRUGE +++$+++ They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
L535251 +++$+++ u2921 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ MALTZ +++$+++ We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
L535250 +++$+++ u2919 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KRUGE +++$+++ Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
L535249 +++$+++ u2921 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ MALTZ +++$+++ Sir, may I --
L535248 +++$+++ u2919 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KRUGE +++$+++ I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
L535247 +++$+++ u2921 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ MALTZ +++$+++ My Lord... what are your orders?
L535178 +++$+++ u2919 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KRUGE +++$+++ Put him on screen!  Study him well.
L535177 +++$+++ u2921 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ MALTZ +++$+++ My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
L535148 +++$+++ u2919 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KRUGE +++$+++ 
L535147 +++$+++ u2921 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ MALTZ +++$+++ 500 Kellicams!
L535141 +++$+++ u2919 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KRUGE +++$+++ Wait!... Wait...
L535140 +++$+++ u2921 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ MALTZ +++$+++ 1,000 Kellicams, closing!
L535133 +++$+++ u2919 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KRUGE +++$+++ 
L535132 +++$+++ u2921 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ MALTZ +++$+++ Firing range, sir.
L535123 +++$+++ u2919 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KRUGE +++$+++ Steady. Continue on impulse power.
L535122 +++$+++ u2921 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ MALTZ +++$+++ Range: 3000 Kellicams.
L534668 +++$+++ u2921 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ MALTZ +++$+++ Yes, my lord!
L534667 +++$+++ u2919 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ KRUGE +++$+++ I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.
L535003 +++$+++ u2930 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
L535002 +++$+++ u2920 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
L535001 +++$+++ u2930 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
L535000 +++$+++ u2920 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
L534999 +++$+++ u2930 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ All true.
L534998 +++$+++ u2920 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
L534997 +++$+++ u2930 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Good for you, Lieutenant.
L534996 +++$+++ u2920 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ Commander, these are some of the most famous people in Starfleet! Admiral Kirk, my God!
L534992 +++$+++ u2930 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
L534991 +++$+++ u2920 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
L534990 +++$+++ u2930 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
L534989 +++$+++ u2920 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
L534988 +++$+++ u2930 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ How is that...?
L534987 +++$+++ u2920 +++$+++ m192 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ You amaze me, Commander.
L534505 +++$+++ u2943 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically --
L534504 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ You're not going in there -- !
L534503 +++$+++ u2943 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
L534502 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there!
L534064 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Would you like to tell me whose are the <u>right</u> hands, my cold-blooded friend? Are you in favor of these experiments?
L534063 +++$+++ u2943 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
L534062 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
L534061 +++$+++ u2943 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
L534060 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
L534059 +++$+++ u2943 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
L534058 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists?
L534582 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Young. I feel young, Doctor.
L534581 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ You okay, Jim? How do you feel?
L534401 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ I'm taking this bunch to sick bay.
L534400 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Hours instead of days, Saavik; now we have minutes instead of hours --
L534388 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik.
L534387 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Until now.
L534381 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And almost got tossed out of the Academy...
L534380 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --
L534372 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ It's like the Garden of Eden...
L534371 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Now that's what I call a meal.
L534336 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Our first order of business is survival.
L534335 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ How can you think of food at a time like this?
L534334 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved.
L534272 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.
L534271 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ But what if they went -- nowhere?
L534270 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
L534269 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?
L534224 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.
L534223 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ They even killed the galley chief.
L534213 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ I can spare me...
L534212 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
L534211 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Khan could be down there!
L534194 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I got beat. We're only alive because I knew something about these ships that he didn't.
L534193 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
L534192 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
L534191 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm <u>still</u> in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis?
L534040 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary.
L534039 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on?
L533983 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.
L533982 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ It never rains but when it pours --
L533886 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.
L533885 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?
L533861 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Ah.
L533860 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Shore leave, Admiral.
L533791 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ I'm your doctor and I'm your friend, Jim. Get back your command. Get it back before you really do grow old. Before you turn into part of this collection.
L533790 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Don't mince words, Bones; tell me what you really think.
L533789 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ From yourself, Admiral.
L533788 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And who am I hiding from?
L533787 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
L533786 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
L533785 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies.
L533784 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Bones, I don't want to be lectured.
L533783 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the matter? Other people have birthdays. Why're we treating yours like a funeral?
L533782 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Thank you.
L533781 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Say thank you.
L533780 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Amazing! I don't know what to say --
L533779 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
L533778 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Exactly. Happy birthday.
L533777 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But I'm allergic to Retlax.
L533776 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
L533775 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Uh -- what are they?
L533774 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
L533773 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.
L533772 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ More antiques for your collection -- Cheers!
L533771 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --
L533769 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Takes the stuff a while to ferment. Gimme.
L533768 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Twenty-two, eighty-three...
L533767 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
L533766 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
L533765 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ 'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.' Happy Birthday...
L533764 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?
L533717 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.
L533716 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
L533704 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I'm not a drama critic.
L533703 +++$+++ u2932 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ That's all you have to say?
L533702 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Physician, heal thyself.
L533939 +++$+++ u2934 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
L533938 +++$+++ u2933 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
L533934 +++$+++ u2934 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ I have my orders.
L533933 +++$+++ u2933 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
L533932 +++$+++ u2934 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.
L533931 +++$+++ u2933 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ <u>Will you please be quiet</u>!  Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular. Who gave the order you are quoting? Who gave the order?
L533930 +++$+++ u2934 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ We have received new orders. Upon our arrival at Regula I, all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha VI.
L533929 +++$+++ u2933 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I still don't under --
L533928 +++$+++ u2934 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ All went well. Nothing has happened. Ceti Alpha VI has checked out.
L533927 +++$+++ u2933 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
L533926 +++$+++ u2934 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
L533925 +++$+++ u2933 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
L533924 +++$+++ u2934 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ ... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant --
L534580 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Something Spock was trying to tell me. On my birthday.
L534579 +++$+++ u2933 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Is that a poem?
L534578 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
L534358 +++$+++ u2933 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ The matrix formed in a day. The life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate. Can I cook or can't I?
L534357 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You did this -- in a day?!
L534349 +++$+++ u2933 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ How can you ask me that? Were we together? Where we going to be? You had your world and I had mine. I wanted him in mine, not chasing through the universe with his father.
L534348 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Why? Why didn't you tell me?
L534347 +++$+++ u2933 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy.
L534049 +++$+++ u2933 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; Stage Three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. What follows is a computer projected simulation of Stage Three. Please watch closely.
L534048 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Wait --
L533997 +++$+++ u2933 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Jim please --
L533996 +++$+++ u2938 +++$+++ m193 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Carol!
