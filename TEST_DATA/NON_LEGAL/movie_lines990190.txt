L437675 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ That's me, Sir.
L437674 +++$+++ u6997 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ BRITISH AIR COMMANDER +++$+++ On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?
L437898 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir.  I was just gonna say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again, even if it was only for five seconds.
L437897 +++$+++ u6998 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ Too late for apologies, Walker.
L437896 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Sir, I --
L437895 +++$+++ u6998 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
L437894 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Hale-what?
L437893 +++$+++ u6998 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.
L437892 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Sir?
L437891 +++$+++ u6998 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
L437890 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You liked that?
L437889 +++$+++ u6998 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
L437888 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Yes Sir.
L437887 +++$+++ u6998 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ COLONEL +++$+++ You're Walker, right?
L437752 +++$+++ u6999 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ COMA +++$+++ You guys know her?!  I gotta have an intro!  Man, I'd like to --
L437751 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Rafe's girl, Evelyn?
L437735 +++$+++ u6999 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ COMA +++$+++ Mai-tai's.  I got this to tell ya, about mai-tai's.
L437734 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Yeah.
L437727 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ What the hell happened to you guys?
L437726 +++$+++ u6999 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ COMA +++$+++ The one that slept in my mouth last night.
L437725 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ What lizard?
L437724 +++$+++ u6999 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ COMA +++$+++ Where's that lizard?
L437723 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.
L437759 +++$+++ u6999 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ COMA +++$+++ Yeah, but he was wearing shoes!
L437758 +++$+++ u7011 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RED +++$+++ Well, you p-puked on his feet.
L437757 +++$+++ u6999 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ COMA +++$+++ Shit, he's puking on my feet!
L437733 +++$+++ u6999 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ COMA +++$+++ You guys are new?
L437732 +++$+++ u7011 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RED +++$+++ I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
L437730 +++$+++ u6999 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ COMA +++$+++ No, like...
L437729 +++$+++ u7011 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RED +++$+++ A m-missionary?
L437728 +++$+++ u6999 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ COMA +++$+++ Ever hear of mai-tai's?  Comes in a big...pot.  Like...like...
L438105 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ He did.
L438104 +++$+++ u7003 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Who the fuck taught you to fly?
L438066 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
L438065 +++$+++ u7003 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
L438063 +++$+++ u7003 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Of the four left, only one is full of fuel.
L438062 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Earl!  You said the planes were ready but -- but what?
L438059 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!
L438058 +++$+++ u7003 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!
L438053 +++$+++ u7003 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...
L438052 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ They ready, Earl?
L438352 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ Yes you can.
L438351 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I can't make it.
L438350 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ Danny...
L438295 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ Home of the Brave.
L438294 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
L438293 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China.  I'm on your wing.
L438292 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Broomsticks instead of tail guns.
L438280 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Longer?  It's getting shorter.
L438279 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ It's not getting any longer.
L438268 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ We'll be loaded with 2,000 pounds of bombs and 1,500 pounds of fuel.  I got another Chinese phrase for Doolittle. "Mug wump rickshaw mushu pork."  It means "Who the fuck thought up this shit?"
L438267 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.
L438266 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ It's shorter than our practice runway.
L438232 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ What's between you and her is between you and her.  But here's what's between you and me.  Everybody has a hero, Danny. And you're mine.
L438231 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Maybe just trying to measure up.
L438230 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ Bullshit.  We've played with each other, pushed each other.  This is different. Like you want to prove that you're better than me.  Who's that for -- Evelyn?
L438229 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ We've always tried to beat each other.
L438228 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ No.  You're trying to beat me.
L438227 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
L438226 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
L438225 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Fun today.  Like old times.
L438208 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
L438207 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
L438093 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I'm out of fuel!
L438092 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ I'm out of ammo!
L438083 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Home of the brave.
L438082 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ Land of the free.
L438080 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Little less.
L438079 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ I got a half a tank.  You?
L438078 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
L438077 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ You hear my okay?
L438074 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.
L438073 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ They're all over us!
L438071 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn.
L438070 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ It's tight.
L438057 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ They're coming around for another pass. You got extra weapons and ammo?
L438056 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's World War Two!
L438043 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Six P-40's.
L438042 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ What's there?
L438041 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
L438040 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ Where are we going?
L438035 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Come on!
L438034 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ Get me into a plane!
L437987 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ How sweet.  Is that when you put the move on her?
L437986 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ She said I was so much like you.  I said, No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am.
L437984 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ She loves you.  I know that.  And part of what she loves in me is how much of you she sees in me.
L437983 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ Fuck you.
L437982 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like you're thinking.
L437981 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I guess I'm used to it.  I've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back.
L437980 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ How come you're not pukin'?
L437961 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ How's this for a fact?  I loved her first.
L437960 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You left her.  How's that for a fact?
L437959 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
L437958 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ So what are you saying?
L437957 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
L437956 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I was grieving too.
L437955 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ I understand how it could happen.  I know why any guy would love her.  And I can't blame you that it happened.  You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.
L437954 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ What facts are those?
L437953 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ We gotta face some facts here.
L437952 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ If you can't keep up, don't drink yours.
L437951 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
L437950 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ Waitress!  Four beers!
L437949 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.
L437948 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ I didn't mean it.
L437947 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
L437946 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ Sorry.
L437942 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Let's go get a drink.  Unless you're scared to talk about it.
L437941 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ Upset?  Why should I be upset?
L437940 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset.
L437668 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.
L437667 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Then why are you looking for her?
L437666 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ Yeah.
L437665 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Didn't you say you told her not to come?
L437607 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Some other time.  I don't feel like a party.
L437606 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
L437605 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Nah, you go on.
L437602 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ Danny, you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose, and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you, or for your mother... or your father, with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas, and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? You've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's time I made mine.
L437601 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
L437600 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
L437599 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
L437598 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ The Colonel helped me work it out.
L437597 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ How could you do this?
L437554 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!
L437553 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ Didn't you say test the limits?
L437535 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ There's another one!
L437534 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Home of the brave!
L437533 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ Land of the free...
L437532 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Good shooting, Rafe!
L437531 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ Good shooting, Danny!
L437530 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Kill the bastards!
L437529 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ It's Germans!
L437528 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Power dive!
L437527 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ Bandits at 2 o'clock.
L437741 +++$+++ u7008 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ MECHANIC +++$+++ We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!
L437740 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Yeah.
L437739 +++$+++ u7008 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ MECHANIC +++$+++ Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
L437738 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ What about easier to hit in an air raid?
L437737 +++$+++ u7008 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ MECHANIC +++$+++ The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.
L437736 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Hey!  What is this, the planes all bunched up like that?
L437910 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Hang on.
L437909 +++$+++ u7004 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ So beautiful!
L437908 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ From the air?
L437907 +++$+++ u7004 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Well...sure.
L437906 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
L437905 +++$+++ u7004 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
L437904 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Sorry.
L437903 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I swore not to talk about him tonight, but there's all this stuff I think I ought to tell you, that he didn't get a chance to.  Rafe was...he was lonely.  He had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty.  The week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter, and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring.
L437902 +++$+++ u7004 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
L437901 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
L437900 +++$+++ u7004 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
L437899 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ How's everything?
L437852 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ ...He said that?
L437851 +++$+++ u7004 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
L437850 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
L437849 +++$+++ u7004 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ You were more like brothers.
L437848 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
L437847 +++$+++ u7004 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
L437846 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened.
L437845 +++$+++ u7004 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were. Because he's dead, isn't he?  And that's why you've come.
L437844 +++$+++ u7000 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker.  I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.
L438277 +++$+++ u7011 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RED +++$+++ Y-Yes Sir.
L438276 +++$+++ u7001 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DOOLITTLE +++$+++ No baseball diamonds, Red.
L438275 +++$+++ u7011 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RED +++$+++ Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
L438274 +++$+++ u7001 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DOOLITTLE +++$+++ I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.
L438273 +++$+++ u7011 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RED +++$+++ I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.
L438272 +++$+++ u7001 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DOOLITTLE +++$+++ Now we have fifteen requests for the Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo baseball stadium.
L438264 +++$+++ u7001 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DOOLITTLE +++$+++ I have a phrase I want you all to memorize:  "Lushu hoo megwa fugi."  It means "I am an American."  In Chinese.
L438263 +++$+++ u7011 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RED +++$+++ Then wh-where do we land?
L438262 +++$+++ u7001 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DOOLITTLE +++$+++ We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
L438261 +++$+++ u7011 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RED +++$+++ C-Colonel, we been p-practicing takeoff's, but I ain't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks.
L438258 +++$+++ u7001 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DOOLITTLE +++$+++ The navy will get us to within 400 miles of the Japanese coast.  We'll launch off the carriers from there.
L438257 +++$+++ u7011 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RED +++$+++ And where's the secret base, Sir?  The one we t-takeoff from.
L438284 +++$+++ u7001 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DOOLITTLE +++$+++ I know.
L438283 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
L438282 +++$+++ u7001 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DOOLITTLE +++$+++ Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't make it, you don't go.
L438216 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ I take it back, about the flowers.  We're all gonna die.
L438215 +++$+++ u7001 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DOOLITTLE +++$+++ I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself.
L438211 +++$+++ u7001 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DOOLITTLE +++$+++ I want to introduce a couple of people. Doc White is a flight surgeon; he has volunteered for gunnery training so that he can go on the mission, because we can't spare the weight of an extra man.
L438210 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ Bombers.
L438209 +++$+++ u7001 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DOOLITTLE +++$+++ In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be flying multi-engines here.
L438201 +++$+++ u7001 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DOOLITTLE +++$+++ Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.
L438200 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ Well sure, Colonel --
L438199 +++$+++ u7001 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DOOLITTLE +++$+++ You're just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience, so you're volunteering for a mission I've been ordered to put together.  Do you know what top secret is?
L438198 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ Is that the good new, Sir, or --
L438195 +++$+++ u7001 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DOOLITTLE +++$+++ Explain what?
L438194 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ We can explain, Colonel.
L438193 +++$+++ u7001 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DOOLITTLE +++$+++ I heard what you did.
L437589 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ Thank you, Sir.
L437588 +++$+++ u7001 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DOOLITTLE +++$+++ Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
L437587 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ Thank you, Sir.
L437586 +++$+++ u7001 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DOOLITTLE +++$+++ That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.
L437585 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage."
L437584 +++$+++ u7001 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DOOLITTLE +++$+++ Don't get smart with me, son.
L437583 +++$+++ u7010 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ RAFE +++$+++ How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
L437582 +++$+++ u7001 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DOOLITTLE +++$+++ There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
L437842 +++$+++ u7002 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DORIE +++$+++ You too, 'Mam.
L437841 +++$+++ u7004 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ You take care, Dorie.
L437840 +++$+++ u7002 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DORIE +++$+++ I left my Mama and joined the Navy to be a man.  They made me a cook -- and not even that, really -- I clean up after the other sailors eat.  I shine the officer's shoes.  In two years, they've never even let me fire a gun.
L437839 +++$+++ u7004 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?
L437838 +++$+++ u7002 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ DORIE +++$+++ Thank you, 'Mam.
