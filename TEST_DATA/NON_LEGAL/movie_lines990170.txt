L417220 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Never been here before?
L417219 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ This is nice.
L417202 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ All I can say is this isn't something that's just going to disappear.  you're all going to have to face it.  Fight it. And if you're willing to work together... wiling to stand up to your deepest fears...I think we can beat it.
L417201 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Yes, tell us, Nancy.
L417169 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Well, we've got --
L417168 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Didn't get much sleep.
L417167 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ You're late.
L417125 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.
L417124 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
L417123 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Call me Nancy.
L417122 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Ms. Thompson.
L417120 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Make sure to check in with Max, he'll give you the 25 cent tour.
L417119 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
L417118 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
L417117 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
L417116 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ What's that supposed to mean?
L417115 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.
L417114 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.
L417113 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Oh God.
L417112 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.
L417111 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Anything?
L417110 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep.
L417109 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ But nightmares are the common thread?
L417108 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ You'll get to meet them all tomorrow. They're...survivors.  In a way.  All severely sleep disordered.  Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting...
L417107 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Tell me about the kids.
L417522 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ We can't get to her.  I've tried.
L417521 +++$+++ u6893 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ TARYN +++$+++ What about Kristen?
L417520 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Okay, straight talk only in here.
L417512 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
L417511 +++$+++ u6893 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ TARYN +++$+++ What'd you do, take the scenic route?
L417370 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer before he died.  After he died, he became ...something worse.  Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong.
L417369 +++$+++ u6893 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ TARYN +++$+++ Who is he?
L417192 +++$+++ u6893 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ TARYN +++$+++ Hey, everybody has bad dreams.
L417191 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Your dreams?
L417190 +++$+++ u6893 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ TARYN +++$+++ I'm Taryn White.  I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit.
L417282 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Neil, please --
L417281 +++$+++ u6892 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ SIMMS +++$+++ That's precisely what they need.  Some uninterrupted REM sleep to release all this negative energy.
L417280 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
L417279 +++$+++ u6892 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ SIMMS +++$+++ We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
L417198 +++$+++ u6892 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ SIMMS +++$+++ The by-product of guilt.  Psychological scars steaming from moral conflicts and overt sexuality.
L417197 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ And what are they?
L417196 +++$+++ u6892 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ SIMMS +++$+++ And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.
L417605 +++$+++ u6894 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ No.  We're alone.
L417604 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Somebody else is out here.
L417603 +++$+++ u6894 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Listen.
L417602 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ What?
L417601 +++$+++ u6894 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ What was that?
L417535 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ You're about to attend a funeral.  One that's long overdue.
L417534 +++$+++ u6894 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L417533 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ We've got work to do.
L417517 +++$+++ u6894 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ They used to keep a spare key.
L417516 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ How do we get in?
L417515 +++$+++ u6894 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ In there.  Charlie Penny owns the place. We knew no one would ever find it.  I'm not even sure I can find it again.
L417450 +++$+++ u6891 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
L417449 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ You said something before...about laying him to rest...?
L417448 +++$+++ u6891 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ The bastard son of a hundred maniacs. Some say he was murdered, though no body was ever found.
L417447 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Freddy.
L417446 +++$+++ u6891 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her child --
L417445 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ My God.
L417444 +++$+++ u6891 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ A young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays.  The inmates managed to keep her hidden for days.  She was raped...hundreds of times. When they found her, she was barely alive...and with child.
L417443 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ The whole facility was shut down in the Forties, wasn't it?  Some kind of scandal...
L417442 +++$+++ u6891 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.
L417441 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ This wing's been closed for years.  What was this place?
L417346 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L417345 +++$+++ u6891 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ Only one thing can save the children. The unquiet spirit must be laid to rest.  It is an abomination to God and Man.
L417344 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I could've saved them.
L417343 +++$+++ u6891 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.
L417342 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ You do volunteer work at the hospital?
L417341 +++$+++ u6891 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ Mary Helena.
L417340 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
L417339 +++$+++ u6891 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ A sad choice.
L417338 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Science...I suppose.
L417435 +++$+++ u6892 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ SIMMS +++$+++ Of course.
L417434 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.
L417433 +++$+++ u6892 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ SIMMS +++$+++ I'm sorry, Neil.  You brought this on yourself.
L417287 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I'll go straight to Carver if I have to.  He'll either back me up or accept my resignation.
L417286 +++$+++ u6892 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ SIMMS +++$+++ I won't allow it.
L417285 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
L417284 +++$+++ u6892 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ SIMMS +++$+++ I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
L417283 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl.  It's a dream suppressant.
L417273 +++$+++ u6892 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ SIMMS +++$+++ There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.
L417272 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ That's enough, Kincaid.
L417181 +++$+++ u6892 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ SIMMS +++$+++ Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome.
L417180 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room.
L417093 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
L417092 +++$+++ u6892 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ SIMMS +++$+++ She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
L417091 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
L417090 +++$+++ u6892 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ SIMMS +++$+++ What did you think?
L417087 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Don't worry, it won't come to that.
L417086 +++$+++ u6892 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ SIMMS +++$+++ If he continues having these outbursts, I'll have to have him isolated permanently.
L417085 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Cooling down.
L417084 +++$+++ u6892 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ SIMMS +++$+++ How is he?
L417526 +++$+++ u6893 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ TARYN +++$+++ Me too.
L417525 +++$+++ u6895 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I'm in.
L417395 +++$+++ u6893 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ TARYN +++$+++ Where...here?
L417394 +++$+++ u6895 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ We're here.
L417375 +++$+++ u6893 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ TARYN +++$+++ Oh sure.  That's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  "Goodnight honey.  Don't forget ot say your prayers. Oh, by the way, your father and I torched some maniac last night."
L417374 +++$+++ u6895 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They never said...
L417372 +++$+++ u6893 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ TARYN +++$+++ Yeah?  What did we ever do?
L417371 +++$+++ u6895 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Why is he after us?
L417211 +++$+++ u6893 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ TARYN +++$+++ I go to bed and get a new horse in the morning.
L417210 +++$+++ u6895 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do?
L417209 +++$+++ u6893 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ TARYN +++$+++ In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves, demon begone.
L417208 +++$+++ u6895 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ C'mon.
L417207 +++$+++ u6893 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ TARYN +++$+++ This is stupid.
L417206 +++$+++ u6895 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
L417205 +++$+++ u6893 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ TARYN +++$+++ Uh, fourteen.
L417204 +++$+++ u6895 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Okay, you're attacked by the Bog Demon. Go ahead.
L417184 +++$+++ u6893 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ TARYN +++$+++ Accident my ass.  I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
L417183 +++$+++ u6895 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a little accident, as you can see.
L422763 +++$+++ u6897 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ And you.  I'll wait till you've gone before I tell him you're a vegetarian.
L422762 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Lovely to meet you.
L422728 +++$+++ u6897 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ Oh God.
L422727 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I'm a vegetarian.
L422726 +++$+++ u6897 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ What do you think of the guinea fowl?
L422717 +++$+++ u6897 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
L422716 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
L422676 +++$+++ u6897 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
L422675 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Hi.
L422765 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Night, night, Honey.
L422764 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ No!
L422761 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You're right.  I told you I was bad at acting.
L422760 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Now you're lying.
L422759 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
L422758 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm delighted.
L422757 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ That was such a great evening.
L422749 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Well... a shot at it.
L422748 +++$+++ u6906 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
L422747 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Wait a minute.  What about me?
L423173 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Oh... no one... no one.  Just some... guy from the past.  I don't know what he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward situation.
L423172 +++$+++ u6901 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
L423171 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ And then I... right.
L423170 +++$+++ u6901 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ 'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
L423169 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?
L423168 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet.
L423167 +++$+++ u6901 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.
L423166 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I'm not listening.
L423165 +++$+++ u6901 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ God, that's an enormous arse.
L423164 +++$+++ u6901 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Oh, stop showing off.
L423163 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
L423162 +++$+++ u6901 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
L422714 +++$+++ u6898 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Right.  Right.  So that's... fairly good.  On the high side... have you tried the nuts?
L422713 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Fifteen million dollars.
L422712 +++$+++ u6898 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
L422711 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Films mainly.
L422710 +++$+++ u6898 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
L422709 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Well, they can be.
L422708 +++$+++ u6898 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
L422707 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I'm an actress.
L422706 +++$+++ u6898 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ BERNIE +++$+++ So tell me Anna -- what do you do?
L423310 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
L423309 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.
L423303 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ And what would you say...
L423302 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.
L423226 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
L423225 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
L423224 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
L423223 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ ... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.
L423222 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ The truth is...
L423221 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ ... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
L423220 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ ... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?
L423218 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
L423217 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Sorry about that.
L423204 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
L423203 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.
L423202 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.
L423201 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ You were saying...
L423198 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ What's the thing?
L423197 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
L423196 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.
L423195 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
L423194 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Thank you.  Shall I...
L423193 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I thought I'd give it to you.
L423192 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Oh no.  It's all nonsense, believe me. I had no idea how much nonsense it all was -- but nonsense it all is...  Well, yesterday was our last day filming and so I'm just off -- but I brought you this from home, and...
L423191 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ...
L423190 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Well... how have you been?
L423189 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
L423188 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You disappeared.
L423187 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Hello.
L423186 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Hi.
L423155 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Drink tea -- there's lots of tea.
L423154 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Okay.
L423153 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ But... wait... there are things to say.
L423152 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
L423151 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ It's not going very well -- and it's our last day.
L423149 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I was going to ring... but... I didn't think you'd want to...
L423148 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I only found out you were here yesterday.
L423147 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ This is certainly... ah...
L423099 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever.
L423098 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
L423097 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Excuse me?
L423096 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
L423095 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
L423092 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
L423091 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
L423088 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
L423087 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
L423086 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott.
L423085 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ That's spectacularly unfair.
L423084 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
