L627073 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Ha!  The little prick ditched you!  That is so goddamn funny.
L627072 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ That's it.  Get 'im Harry  We'll teach that little puke not to signal.
L627071 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ So, you wanna play huh?  You little--
L627068 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Goddammit!  That's outrageous.
L627067 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Look at the way the little punk is driving.  He's all over the place.  Look-- he hasn't signalled once.
L627066 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Okay.  Here she comes.
L627065 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet?  Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch --
L627041 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ And make it fast.  My horse is getting tired.
L627040 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Copy that.
L627020 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Stay on him.
L627019 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ There's another guy, still in the car.
L627018 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Gonna try to get a closer shot of				* Beavis & Butthead.							*
L627017 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ What's the plan?
L627014 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ See, that's the problem with terrorists.  They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules.
L627013 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Helen's going to be pissed.
L627008 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?
L627007 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Station wagon?
L626985 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Yeah, right.
L626984 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What?  It's on the way.  She says she's got something for me.
L626963 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
L626962 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
L626950 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Hi, I'm Harry Renquist.  I own a--
L626949 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ It's all set up...  ghost phones and fax, all the usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under Renquist.  Okay, reality check.  Go.
L626928 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Nope.  The art buys are in a separate ledger.
L626927 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ It doesn't mean anything.  She buys antiquities for Khaled.
L626892 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ In her dreams.
L626891 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You better watch it.  She might file on you for sexual harassment.
L626883 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
L626882 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
L626880 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Well .  .  .  I moved back in. My lawyer said it would give me a better claim on the house in the property settlement.  Don't change the subject... you owe me two hundred bucks.
L626879 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I thought you moved out.
L626878 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Twenty here, fifty there... I figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it.
L626876 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Will you just open the door!					*
L626875 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Okay.  Okay.  De-nail ain't just a river in Egypt.  She's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion.
L626874 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ No way.  Not Dana.
L626873 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Uh huh.  And her little hormones are going like a fire alarm.  I				* say even money that physicist on				* the bike is boinkin' her.						*
L626872 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Right.  She's only fourteen.
L626871 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Fourteen, Harry.
L626870 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she?
L626869 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ See, kids now are ten years ahead				* of where we were at the same age. You probably think she's still a virgin--
L626866 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Yeah, but you're not her parents, anymore, you and Helen.  Her parents are Axl Rose and Madonna. The five minutes you spend a day with her can't compete with that kind of constant bombardment. You're outgunned, amigo.
L626865 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ She knows not to steal.  I've taught her better than that.
L626864 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Kids.  Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery.
L626861 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ What?
L626860 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Son of a bitch!
L626858 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Here, check these out.
L626857 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Thanks dear.
L626834 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Yep.  Sleep fast.
L626833 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What a team.  See you at eight.
L626831 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Got it.  Nice touch.  Okay, pick me up at eight.  The de-brief is at ten hundred.
L626830 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
L626829 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What's this for?
L626824 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What?
L626823 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Harry?  HARRY?!
L626821 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ In the helicopter.
L626820 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Harry!  Where are you!
L626790 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ It's Talkradio.  You're on the air.
L626789 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Switching to sub-vocal.  Gib, you copy?
L627338 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ You're not going anywhere.
L627337 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time.  And I have to get home to my family.
L627323 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--
L627322 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ My husband is a good man.
L627314 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I wasn't cheating!
L627313 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ So, it was your first time.
L627312 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ No!  Never!
L627311 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?
L627297 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I don't know.  I guess... I wanted to see what would happen.
L627296 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ But you didn't.  Why not?
L627295 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I should have gone to the police, I suppose.
L626890 +++$+++ u8625 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JANICE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L626889 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
L626888 +++$+++ u8625 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JANICE +++$+++ Yes sir.
L626887 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ And you still reach for your piece every time.
L626886 +++$+++ u8625 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JANICE +++$+++ Ten, Mr. Gibson.
L626885 +++$+++ u8622 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ GIB +++$+++ Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?
L627512 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Sure.  Say that now.
L627511 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
L627510 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Did you tell her about us, Harry?
L627509 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You're damaged goods, lady.
L627508 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ You think I care about their					* cause?  Or yours?  Not at all.					* See, America is on top now .  .				* .  but so was Rome, once.  All					* civilizations crumble.  One nation succeeding over another. What does it mean in the long run?  The only important thing is to live well.  And...  living					* well takes money.							*
L627499 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Not exactly.
L627498 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Oral hygiene?
L627497 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty.
L627450 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
L627449 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Hello, Harry.
L627003 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Uh, yes, it is important.
L627002 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Yes what?
L627001 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yes.
L626993 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
L626992 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I've always been a collector at heart.  When I see something I want, I have to have it.
L626991 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Is that why you got into this business?
L626990 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Especially in this light.  This is the only light they had then,				* so I like to study it this way. I love this place.  I love all ruins.
L626989 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ It's certainly... dramatic.
L626988 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Do you like my tomb?  The museum				* financing fell out, so I thought				* your clients might be interested.
L626959 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Those wimps.  It's because I use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going.
L626958 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.
L626956 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
L626955 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
L626954 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I agree.
L626953 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Well, what's the point of waiting?
L626813 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I'd like that.
L626812 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces.
L626804 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I adore it.
L626803 +++$+++ u8626 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Very good.  It's sixth century B.C.  Do you like the period?
L626802 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ This is Persian, if I'm not mistaken.
L627644 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Dance?
L627643 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Not yet.  But we'll find him.
L627636 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
L627635 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ ... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.
L627568 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Wait here.  If you have to use this, use it.  Don't choke. Okay?
L627567 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Oh shit.
L627566 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Go down there and kill everybody, I guess.
L627565 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L627562 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ We must be in the Florida Keys .				* .  .  the Overseas Highway					* connects the islands to the mainland.
L627561 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ If we're on an island, why are they using trucks?
L627554 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ No.  Much more.
L627553 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ As much as you used to?
L627552 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yes.
L627551 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Do you still love me?
L627550 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What?
L627549 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.
L627547 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Harry... snap out of it!
L627546 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ God, you have great legs.
L627545 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What is it?
L627537 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Looks that way.
L627536 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
L627535 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ No.  But I wanted to.
L627534 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Did you pork her Harry?
L627533 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ She's really a fox, isn't she?
L627532 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What about Juno?
L627531 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I don't take those assignments.
L627530 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
L627529 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ 17 years.
L627525 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yup.										*
L627524 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Are we going to die?
L627523 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
L627522 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Is it working yet?
L627521 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yes.
L627520 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ It makes you tell the truth?
L627519 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
L627518 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What did he give you?
L627482 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Don't call me honey!  You don't ever get to call me honey again. You understand?!  You pig!
L627481 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I'm sorry, honey.
L627461 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Oh yeah?  Oh yeah?  Then where did I get this?
L627460 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
L627459 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter--
L627447 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You wouldn't believe me.
L627446 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What were you doing there?
L627442 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Harry, be quiet.  Let me handle this.
L627441 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
L627440 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right?
L627431 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I'm not wearing any.
L627430 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Now slide the nylons off one by one.
L627415 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Sure, hon.
L627414 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Allison is sick in bed.  I have to go over there, honey.
L627406 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
L627405 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ So last night was pretty exciting, huh?
L627365 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ No.  Doris.
L627364 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Natasha?
L627363 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ The code name of your contact will be Boris.  Your code name will be--
L627362 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I can do it!
L627361 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most.
L627360 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I think so.
L627359 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?
L627358 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ My husband can't know about this.
L627357 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You will be contacted with the assignment.
L627356 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
L627355 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yes or no.
L627354 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--
L627349 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I love him.  I have always loved him and I will always love him.  Can I go home, please?
L627348 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Louder please.
L627347 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Yes.
L627346 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Do you still love your husband?
L627345 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What?
L627340 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Answer the question--
L627339 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Let me out of her!  Right now!
L627334 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ No.
L627333 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ This Simon.  Did you sleep with him?
L627331 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I needed to feel alive.  I wanted to do something...  outrageous. And... I don't know... it felt good to be needed.  To be trusted.  To be special.
L627330 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What did you need?
L627329 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I don't know.  I guess I needed something...
L627328 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Why?
L627327 +++$+++ u8624 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Yes.
L627326 +++$+++ u8623 +++$+++ m585 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ And you agreed?
