L308282 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.
L308281 +++$+++ u6026 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TYRELL +++$+++ Is there a problem here?
L308193 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
L308192 +++$+++ u6026 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TYRELL +++$+++ Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
L308183 +++$+++ u6026 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TYRELL +++$+++ I'll talk real slow.
L308182 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.
L308181 +++$+++ u6026 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TYRELL +++$+++ Just for a minute, baby. I got something I wanna tell you.
L308180 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
L308179 +++$+++ u6026 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TYRELL +++$+++ You know what I want to do to you ...right now, don't you? There's gotta be somewhere we can be alone.
L308648 +++$+++ u6027 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ He's probably the only one who can help us.
L308647 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ Why? He can't help us.
L308474 +++$+++ u6027 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Alone. In the room.  Got any advise?
L308473 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ How's Julie?
L308472 +++$+++ u6027 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Ahh, that feels great.
L308421 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.
L308420 +++$+++ u6027 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Come on, it'll be fun.
L308405 +++$+++ u6027 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
L308404 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ To a great weekend --
L308280 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ I said we start having fun. And that means now.
L308279 +++$+++ u6027 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Julie, is everything cool? Karla said...
L308228 +++$+++ u6022 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ We'll call you back with all the details...So what's your favorite radio station?
L308227 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
L308225 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ No. Yes?
L308224 +++$+++ u6022 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
L308223 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ Rio de Janeiro!
L308222 +++$+++ u6022 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Okay, Karla, five seconds.  Five...Four...
L308221 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?
L308215 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ Yes!
L308214 +++$+++ u6022 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
L308213 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ Well, I'm in school and --
L308212 +++$+++ u6022 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
L308211 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
L308520 +++$+++ u6024 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
L308519 +++$+++ u6021 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.
L308518 +++$+++ u6024 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too.
L308517 +++$+++ u6021 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Don't really have the market for something like this...  I can go two...two-fifty.
L308516 +++$+++ u6024 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ How much?
L308515 +++$+++ u6021 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Well, there's some flaws in her...
L308514 +++$+++ u6024 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ How much?
L308513 +++$+++ u6021 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Jeez, that's a full carat --
L308674 +++$+++ u6023 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Excuse me, but this island didn't have a murder rate until you people showed up.  I've never seen a dead body before.
L308673 +++$+++ u6026 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TYRELL +++$+++ Must have missed the sign.
L308672 +++$+++ u6023 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ You stumbled into my hiding place.
L308671 +++$+++ u6026 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TYRELL +++$+++ And so could you -- crazy fool.
L308670 +++$+++ u6023 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --
L308493 +++$+++ u6026 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TYRELL +++$+++ The rest of us see bathrobes.
L308492 +++$+++ u6023 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Cool.
L308491 +++$+++ u6026 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TYRELL +++$+++ Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
L308490 +++$+++ u6023 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ What's going on?
L308394 +++$+++ u6023 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ No. I shot him.
L308393 +++$+++ u6026 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TYRELL +++$+++ He leave you?
L308392 +++$+++ u6023 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Not anymore.
L308391 +++$+++ u6026 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TYRELL +++$+++ What's the matter, boy trouble?
L308382 +++$+++ u6023 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Wanna drink?
L308381 +++$+++ u6026 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TYRELL +++$+++ Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
L308380 +++$+++ u6023 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ You guys lost?
L308646 +++$+++ u6027 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I'll go find him.
L308645 +++$+++ u6026 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TYRELL +++$+++ What is up with that weirdo?
L308644 +++$+++ u6027 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Where'd Estes go?
L308603 +++$+++ u6026 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TYRELL +++$+++ Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
L308602 +++$+++ u6027 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ We'll only be a second, okay?
L308587 +++$+++ u6026 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TYRELL +++$+++ Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
L308586 +++$+++ u6027 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos --
L308577 +++$+++ u6027 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here?
L308576 +++$+++ u6026 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TYRELL +++$+++ They were cut loose.
L308559 +++$+++ u6027 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ And do what with it?
L308558 +++$+++ u6026 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TYRELL +++$+++ Take this.
L308542 +++$+++ u6026 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TYRELL +++$+++ Hey -- shut up, okay?
L308541 +++$+++ u6027 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
L308540 +++$+++ u6026 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TYRELL +++$+++ They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.
L308537 +++$+++ u6027 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ They're all dead...Dead, I tell you.  Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss.
L308536 +++$+++ u6026 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TYRELL +++$+++ Where is everybody?
L308531 +++$+++ u6027 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You don't have to be a jerk.
L308530 +++$+++ u6026 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TYRELL +++$+++ I'm just saying what all of you are thinking. It's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time.
L308470 +++$+++ u6026 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TYRELL +++$+++ Crowded.
L308469 +++$+++ u6027 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ How's the water?
L308468 +++$+++ u6026 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TYRELL +++$+++ There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.
L308389 +++$+++ u6027 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ So why are you still here?
L308388 +++$+++ u6026 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TYRELL +++$+++ The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.
L308384 +++$+++ u6026 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TYRELL +++$+++ Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
L308383 +++$+++ u6027 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
L308299 +++$+++ u6027 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it.  Some folks just can't sail.
L308298 +++$+++ u6026 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TYRELL +++$+++ Can't talk right now.
L309177 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ She's in her room.
L309176 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ Where is Miss Wollsten?
L308897 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ The Greeks thought death was beautiful -- an adventure --a journey to another world.  But I have my other guests to think of -- The General will be wanting to go back to his army. If you'll excuse me --
L308896 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
L308895 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
L308894 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn't she?
L308893 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ You don't have to. It's inside of you -- all the glory that was Greece -— the dancing, the singing and the white marble --
L309242 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ May life be good to you both. As for the others —— they will be quiet here —— and I will be with them.
L309241 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Goodbye.
L309216 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Thank you, I'll do that. Good night.
L309215 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ Go ahead. I'll wake you up when I go to bed. Then you can watch him.
L309214 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Well ——
L309213 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
L309212 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
L309211 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
L309210 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ I'll go up and take a look at the General —- perhaps sit with him.
L309209 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
L309208 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
L309183 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ In case you do so, would you --
L309182 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ I'd like to, very much -- but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland.
L308974 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ Or even spirit messages from the next world.
L308973 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ I wonder if my editor's psychic? Reports from the Greek front are going to be a little vague.
L308938 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ That staggering. His dying so quickly.  In your campaigns, have you never seen men who staggered before they died, who talked incoherently —— walked blindly.
L308937 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ He complained of not feeling well. I thought he was drunk ——	he staggered.
L308934 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ He's dead. I want the General to see him.
L308933 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Drunk again?
L308932 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ I need your advice —— something has happened —— Mr.  Jacks ——
L308838 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ Why don't you stay here tonight? Get a good sleep. You can return to your command in the morning.
L308837 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ He is exhausted.
L308826 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ You collect these to sell, abroad?
L308825 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ But the gods played a little trick on me. I was born in Switzerland.
L308798 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ It is my home.  My name is Hugo Albrecht.
L308797 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis.  To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here.
L308796 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ I took it for granted you gentlemen were refugees as are my other guests.
L309085 +++$+++ u6030 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ DR. DROSSOS +++$+++ I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
L309084 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.
L309065 +++$+++ u6030 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ DR. DROSSOS +++$+++ You can have your servants prepare a dinner. That is the way I'll meet my old- familiar enemy -- Death --I have fought him before. I've won often. Now he wins. Let him come for me at my own banquet.
L309064 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ My friend -- what can one say --
L309063 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ ) You feel the symptoms?
L309060 +++$+++ u6030 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ DR. DROSSOS +++$+++ I just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you.
L309059 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ I suppose you want to hear my prayer to Hermes.
L309006 +++$+++ u6030 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ DR. DROSSOS +++$+++ Very well. I'll wager a dinner.
L309005 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ We will see who is the first to die.
L309004 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ Let us put it to the test. Protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. I'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to Hermes -- not that I believe in him any more than I do in Science.
L309003 +++$+++ u6030 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ DR. DROSSOS +++$+++ You're just talking nonsense.
L309002 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little.
L309001 +++$+++ u6030 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ DR. DROSSOS +++$+++ She's right. This is hardly the time to bandy old tales.
L308998 +++$+++ u6030 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ DR. DROSSOS +++$+++ They used to believe that sort of thing in the mountain villages. Some still do --
L308997 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ The ancient Greeks had just as good an explanation -- that the gods sent the plague to punish mortals for harboring Vrykolaka --
L308995 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ Good winds and bad winds!
L308994 +++$+++ u6030 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ DR. DROSSOS +++$+++ If the wind shifts, if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the South -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours.
L309193 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ Maybe you're right. Help me get something to carry her downstairs.
L309192 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ No.  She shall not be left here.
L309191 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow.  I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.
L308960 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Did your servant got word to Dr. Drossos?
L308959 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
L308958 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Did you hear what Thea said -- as if she knew what threatens us.
L308944 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ In the meantime it would be useless to alarm the others.  Let them think it was a normal  And, perhaps it was —- perhaps it was.
L308943 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
L308942 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ I'm not sure that it is the plague.
L308840 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ I'll get Ida to make up your bed.
L308839 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.
L308818 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ I donut understand.
L308817 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ I'm afraid so. There were rumors ——people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
L308816 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ All the graves?
L308815 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ There was some trouble here ——the villagers on the mainland —-this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here ——broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.
L308814 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ But why?
L308813 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ They were gore before I came here.
L308812 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ The enemy is in retreat. There will be no more fighting here.  I came here to visit the crypts. My wife was buried here. What happened to the bodies?
L308800 +++$+++ u6028 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ALBRECHT +++$+++ This was once a cemetery.
L308799 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ I have not been on the island in twenty years. It is changed - changed completely. Where are the graves -- the coffins?
L309180 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ I don't know now without my father.
L309179 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ If Mr. Albrecht is right, we'll all be free in a few days.  I suppose you'll be going on to Athens?
L309094 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me
L309093 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.
L309092 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ Last night Dr. Drossos -- today you or I -- oh, no, Oliver, it can't be you, I couldn't stand it.
L309091 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Poor Cathy --
L309090 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!
L309075 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ Closer and closer —- until they bite into your throat!
L309074 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
L309073 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth --
L309070 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ On my word! That's what they believe.
L309069 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ Oh, no -— it's too delicious! You're making it up!
L309057 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ I think she went to bed —— I saw her going toward the house
L309056 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Where's Thea?
L309008 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ No one can take my father's place.
L309007 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ I know it must be hard. But you have relatives in London --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you --
L308967 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ I think not.
L308966 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ You're not leaving tomorrow..?
L308965 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Sleep well.
L308964 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ Good night, Oliver.
L308947 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ Thank you.
L308946 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
L308945 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
L308867 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Of course. Tomorrow, perhaps, before I go?
L308866 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ I adore hearing Thea sing -- but my poor head's beginning to ache.  I'm so sorry.
L308862 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ M~ father will take care of it.  Pappa is wonderful! No matter what happens, he makes me feel perfectly safe.  I could never leave him. I should be utterly helpless by myself.
L308861 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ I hope Mr. Jacks gets to bed in one piece.
L308805 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ That was my companion. She sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course.
L308804 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ You were singing, weren't you? A beautiful voice, Miss St. Aubyn.
L309205 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ They shall not hurt you
L309204 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ Shh——— it's all right -— I'll be all right.
L309203 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then —- I'll not die —— I'll watch -— they shall not hurt you.
L309202 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ It's getting dark. I can't leave now.
L309163 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ No, that's Thea's bed. Miss Wollsten's bed is in there.
L309162 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Miss Wollsten shares the room with you?
L309160 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.
L309159 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill —— or frightened.
L309158 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ I was looking for you.
L309157 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ What are you doing?
L309105 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ How old is she?
L309104 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ She has never mentioned her family.
L309103 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
L309102 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.
L309101 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?
L309099 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ I'm so ill, I'm so exhausted -- I almost don't care.
L309098 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Poor child. These must be horrible days for you.
