L189701 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Wow.  Why would they do that?
L189700 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill.
L189699 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ They did?
L189698 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
L189697 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.
L189696 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I just kept all PG&E correspondence in one place.
L189695 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Yeah, I can see that.  I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?
L189694 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
L189693 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I'll say.  Holy moley.
L189692 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.
L189691 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.
L189690 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ I know.  They're more than a bit unusual. See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's disease.  That's a kind of cancer --
L189689 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up.  I was going through your file here, and I ran into these medical records.  They kinda surprised me --
L189688 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy.  You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.
L189687 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Right.
L189686 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Thank you.  I think so too.  That's why I'm being such a stickler on this house price thing.  I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's backside, especially after all they've done for Hinkley, but I look around here and I think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it.  And I don't just mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over.
L189685 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey.
L189684 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ...
L189683 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Well it oughta be, with all the work I put into it.
L189682 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ This is a real nice place you got here.
L189681 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Hell, no.  I hate lawyers.  I just work for them.  You got a minute?
L189680 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ You're a lawyer?
L189679 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
L189678 +++$+++ u5073 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Yes?
L189677 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Hi.  Donna Irving?
L190527 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ The firm took in sixty.  That's three percent.  Seemed like a fair bonus to me.
L190526 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Two million dollars?
L190525 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Take it.
L190524 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ What is that?
L190523 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Okay, fine.  <u>Fine</u>  You backed me into a corner again.  You're holding me hostage ...
L190522 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Ed, I swear, I'm not --
L190521 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ "I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."
L190520 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I wasn't gonna --
L190519 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ The extortion, the threats ...
L190518 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Here what comes?
L190517 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
L190516 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
L190515 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You see your office?
L190514 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Careful you don't spit from here; you could kill someone.
L190491 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Cause you got a little voice in your head saying, do the right thing.  Give him another chance.
L190490 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ How do you know that?
L190489 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
L190488 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe, Erin.  The luckiest son of a bitch in history.
L190487 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
L190486 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I did.  Both.
L190485 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
L190484 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I was wrong.
L190483 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Say you were wrong.
L190482 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I don't know what to say.
L190477 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a little something for you, too.
L190476 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Ho - ly - shit.
L190474 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ You know what, Mr. Potter?  I completely forgot your birthday this year.  And seeing as how you've been so good to me, I think that is a terrible oversight.  So what I been doing over the last few days is I've been putting together a present for you.
L190473 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Erin?  What are you --
L190472 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Morning!
L190385 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ No, I'm serious.  You know what Kurt Potter is?  He's the kind of guy who never would have taken this case in the first place. He's the kind of guy who would have sold these plaintiffs down the river when PG&E offered 20 million.  He doesn't work like us, Ed.  There's no little voice in his head telling him to do the right thing.
L190384 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Erin --
L190383 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Fuck Kurt.
L190382 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon.
L190381 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Why not?
L190380 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
L190379 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
L190378 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You're not gonna be there.
L190377 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
L190376 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
L190375 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ When?  Where?
L190374 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ <u>I know</u>.  We're having a meeting, it's all set up --
L190373 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now!  We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
L190372 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime.  So in legal terms, ten years is --
L190371 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be <u>ten years</u> before these plaintiffs see their money?
L190370 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that for the appeal.
L190369 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
L190368 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
L190367 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ So why would PG&E offer it?
L190366 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
L190365 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ And if you had to guess ...
L190364 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L190363 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?
L190362 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I know.  I'm sorry.  Do I get to hear what happened anyway?
L190361 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
L190360 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
L190332 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Perks?  Jesus -- <u>perks</u>?
L190331 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Don't give me that.  You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ...
L190330 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Bullshit.  You stuck me in Siberia dictating to some God damn steno clerk so you could finish this thing without me.  After all I've done for you, that's the thanks I get.
L190329 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No one's taking anything --
L190328 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ How dare you take that away from me.
L190327 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ <u>Not personal</u>?  That's my <u>work</u> in there, Ed. My sweat, my labor, my time.  If that's not personal, I don't know what is.
L190326 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't --
L190325 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ "Fun?"  Jesus, "<u>fun</u>?"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?"
L190324 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
L190323 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ And, what, I'm not serious?
L190322 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Look, this is serious now.  They're talking serious money --
L190321 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Kurt thought?  What about you?  Do you think anymore?
L190320 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Okay, look.  It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
L190319 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.
L190318 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I thought you should rest.
L190317 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
L190316 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Erin, it's just a meeting.
L190315 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your fucking head off --
L190291 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Gee, I wonder why.
L190290 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Not in my world.
L190289 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Because <u>that's how people treat each other</u>!
L190288 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Why the fuck should I respect her?
L190287 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --
L190286 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ She insulted me!
L190268 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ He's got a reputation for doing all his --
L190267 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Why good?
L190263 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Reasons PG&E thinks it shouldn't go to --
L190262 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Counts?
L190259 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It's PG&E saying to the judge that we don't have a case.  Their lawyers go --
L190258 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ What's a demur?
L190249 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor and behave yourself for once.  Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.
L190248 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?
L190244 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.
L190243 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
L190242 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
L190241 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
L190240 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
L190239 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ ... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
L190238 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to make this decision.  50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever.  But ...
L190237 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ So what are you thinking?
L190236 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
L190235 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Whoa.  No shit.
L190234 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.
L190233 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ What kind of things come up?
L190222 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ You might want to think real hard about the amount, too.  My kids are sitting in the God damn parking lot right now, cause I still don't make enough to afford good child care. Makes me think about looking around for a job where I'm appreciated, for shit's sake.
L190221 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'll see what I can do.
L190220 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I want my paycheck.  By the end of the day.
L190219 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Is that what you want?
L190218 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass for you.  I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  And what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had?
L190217 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --
L190216 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
L190215 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh, Jesus.  You wanna tell me what the problem is here, or --
L190214 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Yeah, I mind.  You bet your ass I mind.
L190213 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here --  Do you mind?
L190212 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I want my fucking money --
L190177 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Yeah.  Yeah, I'm ... fine.
L190176 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I was just asking.  Are you all right?
L190175 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
L190174 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ He's gone.  Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?
L190173 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I don't know.  Big.  Dark.
L190172 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What kind of truck?
L190170 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was alone, then he followed me, like, two miles. Jesus, I'm shaking.  Get me a beer.
L190169 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What?  Who?
L190168 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Someone's following me.
L190165 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
L190164 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
L190163 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ D'you get his name?  Course not.  Jesus, Ed --
L190162 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hey.  A new plaintiff called, wants to meet you.  I told him we'd be out there Thursday.
L190153 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ They're trying to intimidate us.  Tell them to wait in the conference room.
L190152 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Jesus.  They look like the Secret Service.
L190150 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Yeah, I heard that one before.
L190149 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously.
L190148 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ If they've sent that little shmuck Baum again, I'm gonna be real pissed off.
L190119 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.
L190118 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hey.  I like working with you.
L190117 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I would now.
L190116 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ You didn't care about my case?
L190115 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
L190114 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Really?  It makes me sick.
L190113 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I like this case.
L190112 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I work on this thing, the more I realize what a crock of shit this legal system is.  Here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer -- that built a pool for a town, then filled it with toxic water -- and <u>we're</u> the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving things?  That's just not right.
L190111 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Then they didn't know.  And if they didn't know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages. And punitive damages is where the money is.
L190110 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Show me the document that proves that.
L190109 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Oh, they knew.  They had to know.
L190108 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
L190107 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ What do you mean?
L190106 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
L190105 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.
L190104 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hey, I got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus I haven't billed a minute of my time since I started on this case, so you can quit hitting me up like I'm rich or something.
L190103 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
L190102 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here.  This is some damn good work.
L190099 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ No --
L190098 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No shit.
L190097 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ For your information, Frank cares what was in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half his day wading around them.  That was his job.
L190096 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Jesus.  I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk.
L190095 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
L190094 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ They skipped that step.
L190093 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground.  But guess what --
L190092 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ It didn't help, but no.  The real problem's on the bottom.
L190091 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ And that's what caused the contamination?
L190090 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ They covered 'em over.  And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock.
L190089 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.
L190088 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds.
L190074 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ <u>No</u>.
L190073 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You wanna talk about --
L190065 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ She lived on the plume.  You never know.
L190064 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Is that what I think it is?
L190020 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Another raise wouldn't hurt.  And with all the time I'm gonna be spending on the road, I'll probably be needing my own cel phone, won't I?
L190019 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What now?
L190017 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah, yeah.  Remind me of that when I'm filing for bankruptcy.
L190016 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.
L190015 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Kinda like David and what's-his-name's whole fucking family.  Okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if, you find me the evidence to back all this up -- I'll do it.  I'll take it on.
L190014 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
L190013 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ This is a whole different ball game, Erin. A much bigger deal.
L190012 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967.  A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.
L190011 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You think there's more?
L190010 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
L190009 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ How many families we talking about here?
L190006 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Okay, fine.  I don't know shit about shit. But I know the difference --
L190005 +++$+++ u5074 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
