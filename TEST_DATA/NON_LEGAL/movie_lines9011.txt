L117929 +++$+++ u655 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ THUMPER +++$+++ What the fuck are you doing?
L117928 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --
L117897 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
L117896 +++$+++ u655 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ THUMPER +++$+++ You really think he wanted to kill you?
L117855 +++$+++ u655 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ THUMPER +++$+++ That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.
L117854 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.
L117851 +++$+++ u655 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ THUMPER +++$+++ Like Ozzy.
L117850 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.
L117842 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts.
L117841 +++$+++ u655 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ THUMPER +++$+++ I thought you were a December baby.
L117840 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
L118280 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
L118279 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Then you think it might have worked out?
L118278 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
L118277 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ And...?
L118276 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ It's crossed my mind from time to time.
L118275 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
L118274 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
L118273 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ I don't get it.
L118272 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
L118271 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ I was?
L118270 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
L118269 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
L118268 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.
L118267 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Is something the matter?
L118266 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
L118265 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
L118253 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Stop! Take me back!
L118252 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
L118251 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Where are we going?
L118238 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family.
L118237 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
L118236 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
L118235 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
L118234 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Sure you don't want your wallet?
L118233 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ There is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin' sorority.
L118232 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Which is?
L118231 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ There's one major hole in your story.
L118230 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ That I didn't leave you there to rot.
L118229 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Know what?
L118228 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ I just thought you should know.
L118226 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.
L118225 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
L118224 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
L118223 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Oh? There's proof now?
L118222 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
L118221 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
L118220 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
L118219 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
L118218 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
L118217 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
L118216 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Yeah?
L118215 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
L118214 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Different? How?
L118213 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Because you're... different.
L118212 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Why's that?
L118211 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
L118210 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
L118209 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ What's happened to you?
L118208 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
L118207 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Ha! Where's that?
L118206 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
L118205 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
L118204 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ I get it. You can drop it now.
L118203 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
L118197 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
L118196 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.
L118147 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Now's the only time!  Today you get a chance to redeem yourself. Start over with a clean slate. Tabula rasa --
L118146 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
L118145 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --
L118091 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ He's a fucking maniac!
L118090 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!
L118080 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ What?
L118079 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
L118078 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.
L118077 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
L118076 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ I walk differently?
L118075 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
L118074 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Like how?
L118073 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
L118072 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ What do you mean?
L118071 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Are you okay?
L118069 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy.
L118068 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
L118067 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
L118066 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
L118065 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
L118064 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
L118063 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
L118055 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
L118054 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Why are you doing all this for me?
L118053 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Go on. Sit down.
L118052 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
L118051 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ You'll see.
L118050 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ I don't understand, where are you taking me?
L118043 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?
L118042 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?
L118039 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.
L118038 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ So it didn't feel... weird?
L118037 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?
L118015 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ I dunno.  Just being weird.
L118014 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
L118013 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?
L118006 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Those are your clothes, silly.
L118005 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Where... where are my clothes?
L118004 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
L118003 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.
L117969 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Who are you trying to convince, Evan?! You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now? Well fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets better!
L117968 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
L117967 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.
L117962 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us.
L117961 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
L117960 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ I know, but...
L117959 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ It was a long time ago.
L117958 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
L117957 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ What do you want to know, Evan?
L117956 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
L117955 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
L117954 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
L117953 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Of course.
L117952 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
L117951 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Me? Are you kidding? Why?
L117950 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
L117949 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But... whatever.
L117948 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
L117947 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Not if you remember my dad.
L117946 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Wow. That must've taken some courage.
L117945 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
L117943 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
L117942 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ So how's Tommy?
L117941 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ I've stopped a hundred times.
L117940 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Not since we were kids.
L117939 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
L117938 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
L117937 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
L117936 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
L117815 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Hi, Lenny.
L117814 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
L117809 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ He must be. They're letting him go, right?
L117808 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
L117807 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Duck, here they come.
L117806 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
L117805 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
L117795 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit.
L117794 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ I deserve a lot worse.
L117793 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Damn. Your dad did this?
L117792 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.
L117791 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L117790 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Ouch.
L117787 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ You really don't remember anything that happened?
L117786 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
L117743 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
L117742 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Oh God... what did we do?
L117722 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ So let's go. This place creeps me out.
L117721 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
L118326 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Been there, done that.
L118325 +++$+++ u652 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
L118324 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
L118323 +++$+++ u652 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
L117995 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you.
L117994 +++$+++ u652 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ ...yes.
L117993 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?
L117992 +++$+++ u652 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ Who -- who are you?
L117991 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
L117990 +++$+++ u652 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ What's happened to -- How are you doing that?
L117989 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood.
L117988 +++$+++ u652 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
L117987 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ What time is it?
L117694 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Kayleigh? What happened?
L117693 +++$+++ u652 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
L117692 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?
L117691 +++$+++ u652 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ Calm down, kid. Stand still.
