L440783 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
L440782 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Your... lover?
L440781 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ My lover and I.
L440780 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ We?
L440779 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
L440778 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Continue.
L440777 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Nine.
L440776 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
L440775 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
L440774 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Continue.
L440773 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Correct. I'm seeking representation.
L440772 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
L440771 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.
L440770 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it.  What can I do for you?
L440769 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Kids are great.
L440768 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Little baby girl.
L440767 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Congratulations.
L440766 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ One week old.
L440765 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ New baby?
L440763 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Uh, yeah.
L440762 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ It's okay. Can I sit down?
L440761 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Whoa-oh!  Sorry, I...
L440760 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ I have AIDS.
L440759 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
L440550 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Funny.
L440549 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Client of yours?
L440541 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I know what it means. Your Honor, imagine how the children in this neighborhood have been made to feel. The pounding of construction ringing in their ears as this skyscraper, a tribute to mankind's greed, grows daily, casting an ominous shadow over their lives, filling them with dread even as they are surrounded in a black, toxic fog, blocking out the sun while poisoning their lungs! And Counselor calls it harmless?!
L440540 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Defined by Webster's as harmless.
L440539 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Innocuous?
L440537 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Your Honor, I submit there were no complaints until Counselor began knocking on doors, drumming up business. And the dust, which Counselor refers to, has appeared on only three occasions. Each time it has been examined and the results...
L440536 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Your Honor, since Rockwell Corp. began construction, the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul-smelling, germ-carrying, pestilent dust. My client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily! Other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage!
L440711 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Get down to Word Processing. Help Jamey look.
L440710 +++$+++ u7049 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ What can I do?
L440709 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint. Which must be filed by fucking five o'clock! If it's late, there's no case...  Every problem has a solution.
L440708 +++$+++ u7049 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I thought I was supposed to be covering for you.  God, Andy, you look awful.
L440571 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Catch me later, I'll be here. And tell Amy, I love her painting, it's on my wall.
L440570 +++$+++ u7049 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.
L440569 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Rach.
L441470 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ Thank you.
L441469 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ No. I can't really see it.
L441468 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ Answer the question, please.
L441467 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ By the time I was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much bigger...
L441465 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ One. Here, in front of my ear.
L441464 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
L441463 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Absolutely.
L441462 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
L441461 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ That's right.
L441460 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?
L441459 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Yes.
L441458 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ Really?
L441457 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
L441456 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ You could have infected him, isn't that right?
L441455 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Yes.
L441452 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?!
L441451 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ In some situations.
L441450 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
L441449 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Some do. I didn't.
L441448 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ Do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks?
L441447 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ No.
L441446 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
L441445 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
L441444 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
L441443 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ No.
L441442 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ Do you need a break?
L441441 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
L441440 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
L441439 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
L441438 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
L441437 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
L441436 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
L441435 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ I guess it was 1984, 85.
L441434 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ When? Approximately what year did this event take place?
L441425 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Yes.
L441424 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
L441423 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Yes.
L441422 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
L441421 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Gay movies.
L441420 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ What kind of movies do they show there?
L441418 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ Have you ever been to the Apollo Cinema on Sansom Street?
L441417 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Not unnecessary ones.
L441416 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
L441415 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.
L441414 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ Do you take risks?
L441413 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Something like that.
L441412 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had "an adventurous spirit." Is that correct?
L441071 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Thanks, Mom... Dad?
L441070 +++$+++ u7050 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
L441069 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Mom?
L441064 +++$+++ u7050 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ He's out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower.
L441063 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Where's Dad?
L441062 +++$+++ u7050 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug.  Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.
L441061 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your fortieth anniversary?
L440585 +++$+++ u7050 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Are you on one of those conference calls? I hate when you put me on hold.
L440584 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Gillman says I'm fine. My blood work is excellent. T-cells are up. Just a sec ...  Yes, I think that would alleviate most of our concerns.  My platelets look good too.
L440581 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Hold on, Mom.  There's no way my client will go along with that.
L440580 +++$+++ u7050 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ What's Dr. Gillman say?
L440579 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ I'm fine.
L440578 +++$+++ u7050 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Andy! This is a nice surprise. How are you, hon?
L440577 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Hi, Mom. It's me.
L440576 +++$+++ u7050 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Hello?
L441176 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ Thank you.
L441175 +++$+++ u7038 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANTHEA +++$+++ Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
L441174 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ Were you recently promoted?
L441173 +++$+++ u7038 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANTHEA +++$+++ Yes.
L441172 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler?
L441158 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ Objection.
L441157 +++$+++ u7038 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANTHEA +++$+++ He was losing weight. He looked kind of tired sometimes. But he was working so hard... Still, I felt something was wrong.  And I can't believe <u>they're</u> saying they didn't notice anything.
L441171 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Thank you. No more questions.
L441170 +++$+++ u7038 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANTHEA +++$+++ I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
L441169 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What did you say?
L441168 +++$+++ u7038 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANTHEA +++$+++ Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt they were too... "ethnic" is the word she used. She said he would like it if I wore something smaller, less garish, and... more "American."
L441167 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Your earrings?
L441166 +++$+++ u7038 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANTHEA +++$+++ Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
L441165 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ In what way?
L441164 +++$+++ u7038 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANTHEA +++$+++ Yes.
L441163 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
L441162 +++$+++ u7038 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANTHEA +++$+++ Is that a question?
L441161 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Ms. Burton. You're black.
L441481 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's <u>see</u> what we're talking about.
L441480 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.
L441454 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?
L441453 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Objection!
L441252 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'll withdraw.  You were aware, when you worked with Maria Torres, that she had AIDS, correct?
L441251 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ Objection!
L441214 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'll rephrase.  Did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced?
L441213 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ Objection!
L441098 +++$+++ u7039 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ BELINDA +++$+++ Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did <u>not</u> know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...
L441097 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.
L440882 +++$+++ u7040 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ DR. ARMBRUSTER +++$+++ Or unprotected sex with someone you didn't know very well, any time during the last twelve years.
L440881 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Uh.... No. Not really.
L440880 +++$+++ u7040 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ DR. ARMBRUSTER +++$+++ Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
L440879 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Get real.
L440878 +++$+++ u7040 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ DR. ARMBRUSTER +++$+++ A homosexual encounter.
L440875 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Thanks, Doc, but I don't need an AIDS test. Are you crazy? But thanks for the information. Really.
L440874 +++$+++ u7040 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ DR. ARMBRUSTER +++$+++ Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
L440873 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
L440872 +++$+++ u7040 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ DR. ARMBRUSTER +++$+++ Right.
L440871 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?
L440870 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!
L440869 +++$+++ u7040 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ DR. ARMBRUSTER +++$+++ Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
L440868 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Why are we going to do that?
L440867 +++$+++ u7040 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ DR. ARMBRUSTER +++$+++ We're going to draw blood.
L440866 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: "whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing?
L440865 +++$+++ u7040 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ DR. ARMBRUSTER +++$+++ Leave that.
L440864 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Right.
L440863 +++$+++ u7040 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ DR. ARMBRUSTER +++$+++ The HIV virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, namely blood and semen.
L440860 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm not worried. What are you doing?
L440859 +++$+++ u7040 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ DR. ARMBRUSTER +++$+++ You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried.
L441122 +++$+++ u7045 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ LAIRD +++$+++ Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now.
L441121 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
L441120 +++$+++ u7045 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ LAIRD +++$+++ I might.
L441119 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ It's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. A cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming. Do you agree?
L441118 +++$+++ u7045 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ LAIRD +++$+++ It satisfied me.
L441117 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
L441116 +++$+++ u7045 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ LAIRD +++$+++ We won.
L441115 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to me like I'm a four year old: Did Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit for you or not?
L441114 +++$+++ u7045 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ LAIRD +++$+++ I may have said something like that. But that's not how I feel at this moment.
L441113 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?
L441112 +++$+++ u7045 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ LAIRD +++$+++ That's correct.
L441111 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct?
L441108 +++$+++ u7045 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ LAIRD +++$+++ We were satisfied.
L441107 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Were you pleased with his work?
L441106 +++$+++ u7045 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ LAIRD +++$+++ That's correct.
L441105 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.
L441104 +++$+++ u7045 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ LAIRD +++$+++ Wyant Wheeler represented us.
L441103 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Andrew Beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990, is that correct?
L441510 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ People who want to bend the rules...
L441509 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What kind of people?
L441508 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ Sometimes it seems like society is <u>run</u> by these kinds of people.
L441505 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job.
L441504 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying? <u>Not</u> about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?
L440827 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ ... we've got a committee meeting.
L440826 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...

L440824 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ We don't think it's fair to keep you here, where your future is limited. But we wish you luck, Andy, all the luck in the world.

L440822 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.

L441206 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Great, Lisa. Thank you.
L441205 +++$+++ u7046 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Okay, so... help me with this one, Joe... Is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone's mouth? Or, is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into <u>their</u> mouth?
L441204 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting.
