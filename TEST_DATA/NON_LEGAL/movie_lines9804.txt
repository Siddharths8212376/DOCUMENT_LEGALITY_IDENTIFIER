L201136 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Stay away from my family!
L200905 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ You've given me the freedom I haven't had in years, and the power to make it pay off in ways I never thought possible.  But hell -- this is America.  One day a pauper, the next day, a prince. And I owe it all to you. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got an important government job to abuse, -- and a beautiful wife to fuck.  Excuse me -- I mean "make love to."
L200904 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ What are you going to do!
L200903 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Let's not confuse things anymore.  I'm Archer. You're Castor.  But if you need proof --
L200902 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ What are you going to do, Castor?
L200901 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Of course I killed them, you DUMB FUCK.  And torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are.  Swallow this one, Commander. You are going to be in here for the rest of your life.
L200900 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ You killed them?
L200899 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used was "titanically remote."  Who knows?  Maybe the trauma of having my face cut off pulled me out.  Or maybe God really is on my side after all.  By the way, I know you don't get the papers in here.
L200898 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ It can't be.  It's impossible.
L200897 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Not anymore.
L200896 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ -- Castor?
L200732 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Don't count on it.
L200731 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
L200730 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
L200729 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Mention my family once more and you're dead.
L200728 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
L200727 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
L200726 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ What's it to you?  I declare it.  Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --
L200725 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ And how much will your "fun" net you this time?
L200724 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun.
L200913 +++$+++ u5189 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ Or what?  You'll have me fired?
L200912 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
L200911 +++$+++ u5189 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
L200910 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Pollux is -- what?
L200909 +++$+++ u5189 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ You better be nice, Castor. You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone.
L200855 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ I'm going to have you fired.
L200854 +++$+++ u5189 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ You'll what?
L200843 +++$+++ u5189 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth SHUT.
L200842 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ They're too tight.
L201246 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Castor Troy almost strangled me to death.  Where the hell were you?
L201245 +++$+++ u5178 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
L201244 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Just saving the tax-payers the cost of a trial.  So take a hike.
L201124 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ I've never been more certain of anything. Get everyone in position. -- And get the word out -- shoot to kill.
L201123 +++$+++ u5178 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
L201122 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
L201069 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Trust me, he's already here. Get going!
L201068 +++$+++ u5178 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ SFPD?  Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.
L201223 +++$+++ u5183 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ JAMIE +++$+++ Yeah, mom cut me some slack -- but I decided ... I'd like to be here for you.  Here, mom.  You can have it back.  Thanks, though.
L201222 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ There's my little darling.  The night wouldn't be complete without you.
L201104 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ I mean like protection.
L201103 +++$+++ u5183 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ JAMIE +++$+++ You mean like ... condoms?
L201102 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
L201101 +++$+++ u5183 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ JAMIE +++$+++ You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
L201100 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ What are you -- stupid?
L200984 +++$+++ u5183 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ JAMIE +++$+++ Like you know anything about it.
L200983 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Get a higher arc on the ball, Jamie.  And for Chrissake, square your shoulders to the basket.
L200942 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Daddy's a new man.
L200941 +++$+++ u5183 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ JAMIE +++$+++ When did you start smoking?
L200940 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ I won't tell mom if you don't.
L200939 +++$+++ u5183 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ JAMIE +++$+++ Clarissa left those here.
L200937 +++$+++ u5183 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ JAMIE +++$+++ Janie?
L200936 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Screw your boundaries, Janie.  You have something I want.
L200968 +++$+++ u5184 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ The Admiral?
L200967 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Get rid of them.
L200966 +++$+++ u5184 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ You've got someone in your office.
L200965 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Let's try to be a little less formal from now on, shall we?
L200964 +++$+++ u5184 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ You always call me Miss Brewster.
L200963 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ That's your name, isn't it?
L200962 +++$+++ u5184 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Kim?
L200961 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Well, I saw you -- Kim.
L200960 +++$+++ u5184 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...
L201248 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ You can't blame me for trying.
L201247 +++$+++ u5190 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down.
L201166 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Obviously someone else knows it!  Get everybody back to their posts -- NOW!
L201165 +++$+++ u5190 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
L201164 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ What?
L201163 +++$+++ u5190 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
L201162 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
L201161 +++$+++ u5190 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ Commander, what are you doing here?
L201145 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ What the fuck do you think happened?  Castor Troy just shot him!  What are you waiting for?  GO!
L201144 +++$+++ u5190 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ What happened?
L201067 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Escaped?  From Erewhon?  I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.
L201066 +++$+++ u5190 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ Castor's escaped!
L201065 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ What happened?
L201064 +++$+++ u5190 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off!
L201072 +++$+++ u5186 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ POLLUX +++$+++ Like I fucking care?  I'm not just sitting here!
L201071 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
L201070 +++$+++ u5186 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ POLLUX +++$+++ What about me?
L201063 +++$+++ u5186 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ POLLUX +++$+++ No problem.
L201062 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ You'll need to recultivate that virus.
L201061 +++$+++ u5186 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ POLLUX +++$+++ Good, because I checked your salary -- and it bites.  How the everyday working-class stiff survives in today's economy is something I'll never ...
L201060 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
L201059 +++$+++ u5186 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ POLLUX +++$+++ Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
L201058 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
L201055 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Yeah -- it's Santa's Magic fucking Village.  Your present's in here.
L201054 +++$+++ u5186 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ POLLUX +++$+++ Eight pocket stingers ... seven piper uzis ... six cobra carbines ...  five - net - launch-ers ...
L201053 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
L201052 +++$+++ u5186 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ POLLUX +++$+++ I'm just having some fun.
L201051 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
L201050 +++$+++ u5186 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ POLLUX +++$+++ Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.
L201049 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
L201048 +++$+++ u5186 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ POLLUX +++$+++ Don't get mad, but I just went for a little stroll through the company switches.
L200950 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Trust me.  You're gonna love it ...
L200949 +++$+++ u5186 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ POLLUX +++$+++ No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
L200948 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ -- I'll be one of the most powerful men in the country. Didn't matter how much cash I made pulling wet jobs -- I was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like Jon Archer after me.  The best part is -- I'm the GOOD guy.
L200946 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ You better get used to it. That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?
L200945 +++$+++ u5186 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ POLLUX +++$+++ I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.
L200944 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Business first.  I went into the "Warrants" system and erased your records.  You're clean.  In fact, you're now on the informant payroll.
L200943 +++$+++ u5186 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ POLLUX +++$+++ You merciless bastard!
L201156 +++$+++ u5185 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ LAZARRO +++$+++ Okay, then.  I leave it in your able hands.
L201155 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ No.  Most of them are in transit by now.  I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
L201154 +++$+++ u5185 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ LAZARRO +++$+++ I just thought that -- under the circumstances -- you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs.
L201153 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
L201152 +++$+++ u5185 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ LAZARRO +++$+++ I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
L200981 +++$+++ u5185 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ LAZARRO +++$+++ Jon, you're starting to remind me -- of me.  Congratulations.
L200980 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
L200979 +++$+++ u5185 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ LAZARRO +++$+++ You'd have to start immediately.
L200978 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ I had doubts too.  I always looked at a desk as though it were a ball-and-chain. But something happened ...
L200977 +++$+++ u5185 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ LAZARRO +++$+++ Me.  I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.
L200976 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ What's that?
L200975 +++$+++ u5185 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ LAZARRO +++$+++ D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  There's just one problem.
L200974 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Just following your example.
L200973 +++$+++ u5185 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ LAZARRO +++$+++ You've made us look pretty good in the past week.  And the way you handled the press --
L200972 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ You're the only person in this place who can see right through me.
L200970 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Normally, I would.  But today ...
L200969 +++$+++ u5185 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ LAZARRO +++$+++ Look at you, Jon -- at your age -- an American hero!  I'd buy you a drink but I know you'd just turn me down.
L201220 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Wait a second -- you hated Madonna.  Didn't you?
L201219 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Back then -- who wasn't?
L201218 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Remember this from our junior prom?  Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.
L201214 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want.  But I have to give you an escort.  Security reasons.
L201213 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I'm going to the powder room.
L201212 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Good.  Because I'm fed up.
L201211 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ I'll deal with her later.
L201210 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ That's what I'd like to know.  She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.
L201209 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Where's Jamie?
L201181 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Okay, I have a confession to make.  But you aren't going to like it.
L201180 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ -- Yes.
L201179 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ I disagree.  You think I've been acting strange.  Like a completely different person.
L201178 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Nothing.
L201176 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ -- Studying.
L201175 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ What are you doing?
L201041 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ I'll have a talk with her. By the way, you never said anything about last night ...
L201040 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
L201039 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Oh, that Karl.
L201038 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Great?  He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
L201037 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Great.
L201036 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
L201035 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Okay, if you insist. But -- you drive.
L201034 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
L201033 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
L201032 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
L201031 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ What's on your mind?
L201009 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Call me spontaneous.
L201008 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ You're wearing your suit --
L201007 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ...
L201006 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... That's great.
L201005 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
L201004 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ -- what?
L201003 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Can't you see I'm trying to change?  I sent Jamie off because I wanted to be alone with you.  I wanted to see the candle-light dance in your beautiful --
L201002 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ You always say that -- then you leave.
L201001 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ I'm not going anywhere.
L201000 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
L200999 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Gone?
L200998 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ So -- how long will you be gone this time?
L200996 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ You wouldn't even sip champagne at our wedding. We were underage -- you wouldn't break the law.  Remember what my brother called you?
L200995 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
L200994 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
L200993 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?
L200992 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
L200990 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ -- I've got to study.
L200989 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Hurry up -- the salad's getting warm and the pasta's getting cold.
L200932 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ No.
L200931 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Don't I usually kiss my wife?
L200930 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ What is with you tonight?
L200929 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ Have fun at work.
L200928 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
L200927 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
L200926 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ The hospital.
L200925 +++$+++ u5179 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ CASTOR +++$+++ It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
L200924 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ As much as ever.  Nothing.

L200922 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ What happened to your big "assignment"?
L202936 +++$+++ u5192 +++$+++ m344 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ You were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? Your trip to Aspen? They’re all panicked here...

L202081 +++$+++ u5192 +++$+++ m344 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ That'll be a nice little holiday treat.
L202080 +++$+++ u5200 +++$+++ m344 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.  Call the group.  Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.
L202061 +++$+++ u5200 +++$+++ m344 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ She's probably just having a fit of nostalgia.  You know, lonely Christmas Eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing.
L202060 +++$+++ u5192 +++$+++ m344 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?
L202059 +++$+++ u5200 +++$+++ m344 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No...
L202058 +++$+++ u5192 +++$+++ m344 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ And look where it's led you...  I'm gonna get her on the phone...
L202057 +++$+++ u5200 +++$+++ m344 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
L202056 +++$+++ u5192 +++$+++ m344 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
L202055 +++$+++ u5200 +++$+++ m344 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
L202054 +++$+++ u5192 +++$+++ m344 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ So you left her?  Just like that?
L202053 +++$+++ u5200 +++$+++ m344 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
L202052 +++$+++ u5192 +++$+++ m344 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ Excuse me?
L202051 +++$+++ u5200 +++$+++ m344 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
L202050 +++$+++ u5192 +++$+++ m344 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ You?  Married?
L202049 +++$+++ u5200 +++$+++ m344 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
L202048 +++$+++ u5192 +++$+++ m344 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ Yeah Jack, her assistant...
L202047 +++$+++ u5200 +++$+++ m344 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Her assistant?
L202046 +++$+++ u5192 +++$+++ m344 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ Her assistant said you could call her at home after eight.
L202045 +++$+++ u5200 +++$+++ m344 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Kate Reynolds...
L202044 +++$+++ u5200 +++$+++ m344 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Ooh, my suits are ready...

L202042 +++$+++ u5192 +++$+++ m344 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.
L202041 +++$+++ u5200 +++$+++ m344 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You too?  This holiday's about giving, Adelle.  And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone...  Lifesaver?
L202948 +++$+++ u5193 +++$+++ m344 +++$+++ ALAN +++$+++ So what are we gonna do, Jack?
