L254926 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Thought you was in jail.
L254925 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
L254924 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Casy! What you doin' here?
L254923 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ What's the matter?
L254774 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ Hide in the willows. If it's awright to come back I'll give you four high whistles.
L254773 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You're right!
L254772 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?
L254771 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I ain't gonna run.
L254770 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ Gimme that gun. Now git outa here. Go down in them willows an' wait.
L254551 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ I don't know.
L254550 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ How about us? Is that the truth for us?
L254489 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ I'll say 'em--an' make it short.  This here ol' man jus' lived a life an' jus' died out of it. I don't know whether he was good or bad, an' it don't matter much. Heard a fella say a poem once, an' he says, "All that lives is holy." But I wouldn't pray for jus' a ol' man that's dead, because he's awright. If I was to pray I'd pray for the folks that's alive an' don't know which way to turn. Grampa here, he ain't got no more trouble like that. He's got his job all cut out for 'im--so cover 'im up and let 'im get to it.
L254488 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ We know. But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.
L254487 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ I ain't no more a preacher, you know.
L254435 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ If she does it'll be a miracle outa Scripture.
L254434 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Think she'll hold?
L254356 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ It's hard to say. Stay here till mornin' an' then go on over to Uncle John's, I reckon. After that I don't know.
L254355 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ What you figger to do?
L254354 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ She's settlin'.
L254298 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ All right, you remember the *man* then.
L254297 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ I ain't no preacher anymore.
L254296 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ This is Muley Graves.  You remember the preacher, don't you?
L254291 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ I never heard nothin' about it.
L254290 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead?
L254288 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ No. They wasn't people to write.
L254287 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ They never wrote you nothing?
L254286 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ They're all gone--or dead.
L254281 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ That's our place.
L254280 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ Your granma was a great one, too. The third time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a full-growed deacon with her fist.
L254279 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Just around that next bend.
L254278 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ Is it fur?
L254277 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ Shore it is. It always is, this time a year.
L254276 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!
L254275 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.
L254274 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas.
L254273 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ It don't matter. Ever since I lost the sperit it looks like I just as soon go one way as the other.  I'll go your way.
L254272 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
L254271 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ Ain't you seen your folks since then?
L254270 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole.
L254269 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ And you ain't ashamed?
L254268 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.
L254267 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ Excuse me for asking.
L254266 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I been in the penitentiary for four years. 
L254265 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ No, I never. What?
L254264 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
L254263 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ Been out travelin' around?
L254262 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
L254261 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  Nice drinkin' liquor.
L254260 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Have a little snort?
L254259 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
L254258 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
L254257 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
L254256 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
L254255 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.
L254254 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
L254253 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ *Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.
L254252 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Why, you're the preacher!
L254251 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.
L254250 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Yeah. On my way home now.
L254249 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ Say, ain't you young Tom Joad--ol' Tom's boy?
L254675 +++$+++ u5629 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ I ought to done it then--an' not come on any trip like this.
L254674 +++$+++ u5645 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ ROSASHARN +++$+++ But we can still do it, honey.
L254673 +++$+++ u5629 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work.
L254672 +++$+++ u5645 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ ROSASHARN +++$+++ You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
L254671 +++$+++ u5629 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ Women is always tar'd.
L254670 +++$+++ u5645 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ ROSASHARN +++$+++ Seems like we wasn't never gonna do nothin' but move. I'm so tar'd.
L254866 +++$+++ u5630 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. Just follow the line.
L254865 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ What's the matter? What's happened?
L254864 +++$+++ u5630 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
L254863 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Sure do.

L254504 +++$+++ u5630 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
L254503 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ They shore don't waste no time!  Take her out.
L254343 +++$+++ u5631 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ DAVIS +++$+++ You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere. First place, you'd get hung and you know it. For another, it wouldn't be two days before they'd have another guy here to take my place.
L254342 +++$+++ u5643 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MULEY +++$+++ Have it your own way, son, but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat I'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come.
L254339 +++$+++ u5631 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ DAVIS +++$+++ *Used* to be your land. B'longs to the comp'ny now.
L254338 +++$+++ u5643 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MULEY +++$+++ But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
L254337 +++$+++ u5631 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ DAVIS +++$+++ For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.
L254336 +++$+++ u5643 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MULEY +++$+++ Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?
L254335 +++$+++ u5631 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ DAVIS +++$+++ I don't like nobody drawin' a bead on me.
L254246 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Sure, but you'd a throwed a fit if I hadn't tol' you.
L254245 +++$+++ u5632 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ I never asked you!
L254243 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ That's where I get off.

L254241 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
L254240 +++$+++ u5632 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ I didn't mean nothing.
L254239 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
L254238 +++$+++ u5632 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ You ain't got to get sore.

L254233 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been?
L254232 +++$+++ u5632 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ Get to what?

L254651 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do. 
L254650 +++$+++ u5633 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ FIRST BOY +++$+++ Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
L254649 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
L254648 +++$+++ u5633 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ FIRST BOY +++$+++ Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.

It ain't no good--  --but it's mine.

L254443 +++$+++ u5644 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ PA +++$+++ But you can't *do* that, Grampa. This here land is goin' under the tractor. We *all* got to git out.
L254442 +++$+++ u5637 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ GRAMPA +++$+++ I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'.
