L554341 +++$+++ u7948 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.
L554257 +++$+++ u7948 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ I-I'm sorry - can someone else please run the Ouija board?  It's creepy, it's wrong and it goes against the teachings of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
L554256 +++$+++ u7944 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ ... Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt... Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?
L554644 +++$+++ u7946 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ GRANDMOTHER +++$+++ You damn well better...
L554643 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry.
L554642 +++$+++ u7946 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ GRANDMOTHER +++$+++ Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate.  Where's my smokes?
L554641 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
L554640 +++$+++ u7946 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ GRANDMOTHER +++$+++ You got that big retarded girl down there?
L554639 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ Thanks!  That'd be great.
L554638 +++$+++ u7946 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ GRANDMOTHER +++$+++ Oh well, then I'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals.
L554637 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ Oh yeah, you caught us...
L554636 +++$+++ u7946 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ GRANDMOTHER +++$+++ Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
L554635 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
L554634 +++$+++ u7946 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ GRANDMOTHER +++$+++ Is that you down there?
L554633 +++$+++ u7946 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ GRANDMOTHER +++$+++ Kansas?
L554632 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ Screw Lucy!
L554584 +++$+++ u7947 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ Maybe we can make a deal.
L554583 +++$+++ u7952 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone.  Promise!
L554568 +++$+++ u7947 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ That's Itchy, alright.  How many y'need?
L554567 +++$+++ u7952 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Definitely old.
L554566 +++$+++ u7947 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ She did, did she?  How is the old girl?
L554565 +++$+++ u7952 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
L554564 +++$+++ u7947 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ Really...
L554681 +++$+++ u7948 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ All of you!
L554680 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ Bank branch!
L554679 +++$+++ u7948 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Bank branch!
L554678 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ All of you!
L554604 +++$+++ u7948 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Hey, I even took my parents' foster kid money.  Phillipe's gonna have to gather rice without pants this month.
L554603 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ Don't make me Jerry Lewis you guys for the rest.
L554499 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ 'Cause I will Jerry Springer you faster than you can say "Fat-assed lesbian!"
L554498 +++$+++ u7948 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Uh...maybe?
L554497 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ You sure you wanna go there?
L554491 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched "Dog Day Afternoon!"
L554490 +++$+++ u7948 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ I'm only allowed "G" movies.
L554489 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!
L554488 +++$+++ u7948 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ ...so, while it's a laugh riot for the whole family, and Tim Conway is just about as funny as they come, especially when he goes...
L554333 +++$+++ u7948 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ But you're not married.
L554332 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ Oh my G-d!  I'm not first!
L554261 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ Hold up, hold up.  Any sentence that starts with "at church camp" ain't leading to the big "O."
L554260 +++$+++ u7948 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Yeah.  This summer at church camp?  I'm pretty sure I had, y'know, an orgasm.
L554259 +++$+++ u7948 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Well technically, I don't think I'm a virgin anymore.
L554258 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ Hannah, in order to get real answers from the netherworld, you've gotta have a Christian virgin run the board.  Your kind is pure of heart - the devil won't dick with you.
L554536 +++$+++ u7953 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ MRS. HILL +++$+++ Wait, Petunia.  Mommy's a little amped up - didn't get her yard time this morning.  Mink ain't my bitch.  She's a specialist... in banks.
L554535 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.
L554534 +++$+++ u7953 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ MRS. HILL +++$+++ What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
L554533 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
L554532 +++$+++ u7953 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ MRS. HILL +++$+++ Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.
L554531 +++$+++ u7953 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ MRS. HILL +++$+++ So you need my help?  Oh my G-d, this is like asking me for help with your homework.  Hey, Mink, c'mere!
L554530 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
L554529 +++$+++ u7953 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ MRS. HILL +++$+++ Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
L554528 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.
L554527 +++$+++ u7953 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ MRS. HILL +++$+++ Before you?  Whoo-hoo!
L554526 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ My best friend got pregnant.
L554525 +++$+++ u7953 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ MRS. HILL +++$+++ Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
L554524 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ Okay, you can't tell anybody.
L554523 +++$+++ u7953 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ MRS. HILL +++$+++ Now how the hell can I help you?
L554522 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ Your help.
L554521 +++$+++ u7953 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ MRS. HILL +++$+++ My what?
L554520 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ I don't hate you.  I need your help.
L554519 +++$+++ u7953 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ MRS. HILL +++$+++ So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
L554518 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ They could kill you.
L554517 +++$+++ u7953 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ MRS. HILL +++$+++ I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.
L554516 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ You shouldn't smoke so many of those.
L554515 +++$+++ u7953 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ MRS. HILL +++$+++ Thank G-d.  I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.
L554514 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.
L554670 +++$+++ u7952 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ I want to help.  I'm part of this squad...
L554669 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ What the hell do you want?
L554456 +++$+++ u7952 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Stop it!  This is crazy!
L554455 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had.  If one of us needs something, we all do.
L554403 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
L554402 +++$+++ u7952 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ ...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
L554401 +++$+++ u7950 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ KANSAS +++$+++ More proof God's a guy...
L554400 +++$+++ u7952 +++$+++ m538 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas.
L555395 +++$+++ u7958 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DEMILLE +++$+++ Action! The scene starts.
L555394 +++$+++ u7954 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ 1ST ASSISTANT +++$+++ Roll 'em.
L555393 +++$+++ u7958 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DEMILLE +++$+++ You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
L555392 +++$+++ u7954 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ 1ST ASSISTANT +++$+++ We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.
L555346 +++$+++ u7958 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DEMILLE +++$+++ She got to be.  A dozen press agents working overtime can do terrible things to the human spirit.  Hold everything.
L555345 +++$+++ u7954 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ 1ST ASSISTANT +++$+++ I hear she was a terror to work with.
L555344 +++$+++ u7958 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DEMILLE +++$+++ Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
L555343 +++$+++ u7954 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ 1ST ASSISTANT +++$+++ I didn't mean to --
L555342 +++$+++ u7958 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DEMILLE +++$+++ Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?
L555341 +++$+++ u7954 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ 1ST ASSISTANT +++$+++ I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room.  I can give her the brush ...
L555340 +++$+++ u7958 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DEMILLE +++$+++ It must be about that appalling script of hers.  What can I say to her? What can I say?
L555339 +++$+++ u7954 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ 1ST ASSISTANT +++$+++ I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
L555338 +++$+++ u7958 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ DEMILLE +++$+++ I hate to think where that puts me.  I could be her father.
L555287 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I've got to run along.  Thanks any- way for your interest in my career.
L555286 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ The accent! I've got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government. Get those studs.  Get those cuff-links.
L555261 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ Someone in the formal set, no doubt, with a ten-carat kidney stone.
L555260 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
L555259 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ Walking out on the mob.  What's the big idea?
L555161 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Don't worry.  She's just a fan for my literary output.
L555160 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ Wait a minute.  This is the woman I love.  What's going on? Who was loaded?
L555154 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ I'll have the bell-hop take care of your luggage.
L555153 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I'll take it.
L555152 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
L555151 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
L555150 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ Sure, this'll go on all night.
L555149 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Listen, Artie, can I stick around here for a while?
L555148 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
L555147 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Good party.
L555146 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Where's the bar?
L555145 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ Say, you're not really smuggling opium these days,  are you?
L555144 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Close, but no cigar.
L555143 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?
L555141 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ Come on.
L555140 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ That was the general idea.
L555139 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ You're going to stay, aren't you?
L555138 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Let it ride for a while.
L555137 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ Give me your coat.
L555136 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ I almost reported you to the Bureau of Missing Persons.  Fans, you all know Joe Gillis, the well-known screen writer, opium smuggler and Black Dahlia suspect.
L555135 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ In a deep freeze.
L555134 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
L555133 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Hi, Artie.
L555132 +++$+++ u7955 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ Well, what do you know ! Joe Gillis !
L554838 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.
L554837 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics.  Thank you, Miss Schaefer.
L554831 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I just think pictures should say a little something.
L554830 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Name dropper.
L554826 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
L554825 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ This is Miss Kramer.
L554824 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
L554823 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
L554822 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Nothing for Ladd?
L554821 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It's from hunger.
L554820 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ What's wrong with it?
L554819 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page synopsis.  But I wouldn't bother.
L555595 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Nobody asked you to.
L555594 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Joe, I can't look at you any more.
L555593 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
L555592 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ If you love me, Joe.
L555591 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
L555590 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Come on, Joe.
L555589 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?
L555588 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
L555587 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
L555586 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No.
L555585 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
L555584 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
L555583 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Her own movie theatre.
L555582 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Jealous.  Ever see so much junk? She had the ceiling brought from Portugal.  Look at this.
L555581 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Why did she call me?
L555580 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
L555579 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
L555578 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
L555577 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Whose?
L555576 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Hers.
L555575 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Whose house is it?
L555574 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ You bet.
L555573 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ This is where you live?
L555572 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Ever been in one of these old Hollywood palazzos? That's from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week, and no taxes.  Careful of these tiles, they're slippery. Valentino used to dance here.
L555571 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Come on in, Betty,
L555570 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
L555569 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Hello, Betty.
L555546 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You did.
L555545 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What happened?
L555544 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Of course I love him.  I always will.  I'm just not in love with him any more.
L555543 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Why not? Don't you love Artie?
L555542 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I don't want it now.
L555541 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Stop crying.  You're getting married.  That's what you've always wanted.
L555540 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Why don't you? We can finish the script by Thursday.
L555539 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
L555538 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ From Artie.  What's wrong?
L555537 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.
L555536 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Betty, there's no use running out on it.  Let's face it, what- ever it is.
L555534 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What is it you've heard.  Come on, let's have it.
L555533 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I just don't.
L555532 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Why not?
L555531 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
L555530 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
L555529 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Was I?  I'm sorry.
L555528 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Hey, what's the matter... Betty, wake up!  Why are you staring at me like that?
L555513 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ That's it -- there's nothing like being twenty-two.  Now may I suggest that if we're ever to finish this story you keep at least two feet away from me ...  Now back to the typewriter.
L555512 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Twenty-two.
L555511 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?
L555510 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It must be my new shampoo.
L555509 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ May I say you smell real special.
L555508 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ If you please.
L555507 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
L555506 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
L555505 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
L555504 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...
L555503 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Saddest thing I ever heard.
L555502 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
L555501 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Nice job.
L555500 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
L555499 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Second generation, huh?
L555498 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.
L555497 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What were you -- a child actress?
L555496 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Look at this street.  All card- board, all hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors.  I like it better than any street in the world.  Maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid.
L555494 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ That's the trouble with you readers.  You know all the plots. Now suppose you proof-read page ten while the water boils.
L555493 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
L555492 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
L555491 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'll say.  This is solid gold.
L555490 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Oh, that.  It's from a friend of mine.  A middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous.
L555489 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
L555488 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Who's who?
L555487 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Who's Norma?
L555486 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Constantly.  No, in all serious- ness, it's really good.  It's fun writing again.  I'm happy here, honest I am.
L555485 +++$+++ u7956 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
