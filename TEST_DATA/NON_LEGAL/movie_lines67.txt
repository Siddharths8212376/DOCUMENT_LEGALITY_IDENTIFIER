L64613 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?
L65179 +++$+++ u469 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ NEWCOMBE +++$+++ When I asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship's assurances, they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth, in their presence, at their counting-house in Birchin Lane, London.  I requested they come here, and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to London, but they declined, saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to Castle Hackton to negotiate, as they were aware of how other respectable parties, such as Messrs. Sharp and Salomon had been treated here.
L65178 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I see.
L65177 +++$+++ u469 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ NEWCOMBE +++$+++ Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
L65176 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Yes, of course.
L65175 +++$+++ u469 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ NEWCOMBE +++$+++ May I be quite frank with you?
L65174 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
L65173 +++$+++ u469 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ NEWCOMBE +++$+++ There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
L65172 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
L65171 +++$+++ u469 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ NEWCOMBE +++$+++ Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
L65170 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
L65169 +++$+++ u469 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ NEWCOMBE +++$+++ I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.
L65146 +++$+++ u470 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
L65145 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Yes, he's fine.
L65144 +++$+++ u470 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Is he all right, papa?
L65143 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.
L65133 +++$+++ u470 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Yes, papa.
L65132 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.
L65127 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?
L65126 +++$+++ u470 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
L65125 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Yes?
L65124 +++$+++ u470 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Papa?
L65123 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Good night, my little darling.
L65122 +++$+++ u470 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Good night, papa.
L65120 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
L65119 +++$+++ u470 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
L65118 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
L65117 +++$+++ u470 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Did you buy the horse, papa?
L65006 +++$+++ u474 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ SIR WILLIAM +++$+++ I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
L65005 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Sir, let those laugh that win.
L65004 +++$+++ u474 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ SIR WILLIAM +++$+++ Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
L65003 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
L65002 +++$+++ u474 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ SIR WILLIAM +++$+++ Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
L65001 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
L65000 +++$+++ u474 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ SIR WILLIAM +++$+++ He wants to step into my shoes!  He wants to step into my shoes!
L64999 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
L64998 +++$+++ u474 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ SIR WILLIAM +++$+++ Gentlemen, see this amiable youth! He has been troubled by religious scruples, and has flown for refuge to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has asked for advise from my wife, Lady Cosgrove, and between them both, they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith.  Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple?
L64997 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I think, Sir William Cosgrove, you have had too much drink.  Your chaplin, Mr. Hunt, has introduced me into the company of your lady to advise me on a religious matter, of which she is a considerable expert.
L64996 +++$+++ u474 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ SIR WILLIAM +++$+++ Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
L64995 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L64994 +++$+++ u474 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ SIR WILLIAM +++$+++ Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
L64993 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.
L64936 +++$+++ u474 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ SIR WILLIAM +++$+++ Well, why not a milkmaid's daughter? No man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife's sake; on the contrary, if he selects the animal properly, he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure, but a comfort in his hours of annoyance.  For instance, I have got the gout; who tends me?  A hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power.  My wife never comes near me.  What friend have I?  None in the wide world.  Men of the world, as you and I are, don't make friends, and we are fools for our pains.
L64935 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ The milkmaid's daughter?
L64934 +++$+++ u474 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ SIR WILLIAM +++$+++ In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
L64933 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Would you have me spend my life all alone?
L64932 +++$+++ u474 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ SIR WILLIAM +++$+++ Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at me.  Marriage has added forty years to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty.  When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself.  Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable.  Take a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps.  Do anything, but marry.
L64930 +++$+++ u474 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ SIR WILLIAM +++$+++ Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.
L64929 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.
L64888 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Tender Hegenheim.
L64887 +++$+++ u475 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ VALDEZ +++$+++ He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
L64886 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Will he wish to know the details of this night?
L64885 +++$+++ u475 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ VALDEZ +++$+++ He loves me, as I love you.
L64884 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
L64883 +++$+++ u475 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ VALDEZ +++$+++ He is only curious to know who you are.
L64882 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ And he doesn't care about me?
L64881 +++$+++ u475 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ VALDEZ +++$+++ Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
L64880 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
L64879 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Dark Valdez.
L64878 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Black-eyed Sczortarska.
L64877 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Charming Schuvaloff.
L66030 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Old friend. Haven't talked to him in -- 911. Can I use your phone?
L66029 +++$+++ u476 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ Who?
L66028 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Bill Styles...
L66025 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.
L66024 +++$+++ u476 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ Hurricane kept you up, too?
L66023 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Don't you mean "don't need no liquor license not taken away from me"?
L66022 +++$+++ u476 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
L66021 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Yeah, if you've slept.
L66020 +++$+++ u476 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ It's ten thirty in the morning.
L66019 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Can I at least have a drink?
L66018 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You know that was like a quadruple negative?
L66017 +++$+++ u476 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.
L66621 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
L66620 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ You framed-him...
L66370 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
L66369 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ He is the only one unaccounted for.
L66344 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
L66343 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ What about Pike?
L66326 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
L66325 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Did -- did you --
L66322 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ Fine.
L66321 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ I don't want to go --
L66320 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
L66319 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ What do we do?
L66318 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
L66306 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ Just safety your shit and get behind me, okay? I'll take care of this.
L66305 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
L66304 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?
L66300 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ I'm -- I'm sorry...
L66299 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ Don't you ever point a gun at me!
L66619 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ Shut up, Mueller.
L66618 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ West was one thing, but this --
L66341 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ HEY!
L66340 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
L66338 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ I don't know!
L66337 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
L66336 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ We got -- I don't know, we got separated
L66332 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
L66331 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ You killed him you fucking faggot --
L66330 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ We found him like this --
L66329 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
L66328 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Can anybody hear me!
L66327 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
L66617 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
L66616 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ You too?
L66506 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Shut up.  West's dead.
L66505 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ Yeah, right...
L66484 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ We found him like this...
L66483 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
L66356 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ What do you mean, alone?
L66355 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --
L66351 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ We don't know. West is dead.
L66350 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?
L67044 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ He's telling the truth up to a point...
L67043 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
L67042 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
L66918 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ You won't find them. Won't find West, either. He's too good.
L66917 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ And the bodies?
L66916 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.
L66865 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
L66864 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Do what?
L66863 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ He -- He made me do it --
L66853 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Jesus!
L66852 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --
L66848 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ We've found all of them.
L66847 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
L66846 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ We don't need the tapes --
L66824 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ You wanna bet?
L66823 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ We're not finished yet --
L66635 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.
L66634 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --
L66629 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ But not Pike's.
L66628 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You saved Kendall's life --
L66627 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
L66626 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You shot Childs and Nunez.
L66479 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Yeah --
L66478 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ And he'd been shot.
L66475 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Of course --
L66474 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You saw West's body.
L66473 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I apologize --
L66444 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Yeah, we know, Pike did.
L66443 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I didn't shoot West --
L66442 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --
L66437 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
L66436 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.
L66435 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I'm serious --
L66434 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
L66433 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ He's lying.
L66432 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ That'd be my reaction too --
L66431 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ That son of a bitch.
L66430 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people!
L66200 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ No, actually, I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some.
L66199 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
L66198 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You smoke, Ray?
L66197 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
L66196 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
L66149 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Tell me about them.
L66148 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Some.
L66147 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Okay... but I would like to know about the other cadets. What they were like -- nice guys?
L66146 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I'm not telling you what happened.
L66145 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
L66136 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Okay.
L66135 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?
L66129 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ They're dead, aren't they?
L66128 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ There's no need...
L66125 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
L66124 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ You did Basic here?
L66123 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
L66122 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I don't know... I like the Army.
L66121 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ What do you like then?
L66120 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I just don't like it.
L66119 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
L66118 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ It's... too slow.
L66117 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
L66116 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I asked for a policeman.
L66115 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Why not?
L66851 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -- no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives... you have nothing.
L66850 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ How do you know that?
L66849 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Ohhhh, I don't think so...
L66844 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar? Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record? No. You assumed who I was, because I was wearing this uniform. Don't believe me?
L66843 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
L66842 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
L66840 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Can't do that now, though, can you?
L66839 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.
L66633 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
L66632 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Where's the cabin?
L66631 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Would you have believed me?
L66630 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
L66493 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Yeah.
L66492 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Mueller was alone in the cabin?
L66491 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Back up.
L66481 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --
L66480 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ What about the phosphorous grenade?
L66477 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ The creek bed --
L66476 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Where?
L66441 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
L66440 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ What business?
L66439 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
L66438 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ He said he worked there --
