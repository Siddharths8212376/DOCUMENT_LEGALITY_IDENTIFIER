L249632 +++$+++ u5618 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ No students work for me.
L249631 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
L249630 +++$+++ u5618 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Yeah, can I help you?
L249629 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office?
L250481 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Thank you, Will. I'll do that.
L250480 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
L250479 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Yes.
L250478 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I appreciate that.
L250477 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ This job... Do it if it's what you really want.
L250476 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Bullshit.
L250475 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
L250474 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Thank you.
L250473 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Sam called me. From Tri-tech. He says you start working for them next week.
L250472 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
L250471 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ You know, you're no longer required to come here.
L250470 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Hey, how you doin'?
L250469 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Will.
L250390 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ No, that's fine, Will. I was just leaving.
L250389 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I can come back.
L250291 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
L250290 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ What are you smiling at?
L250227 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ So am I.  Yes. That's right, Will. Most days I wish I never met you. Because then I could sleep at night. I wouldn't have to walk around with the knowledge that someone like you was out there. And I wouldn't have to watch you throw it all away.
L250226 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Well, I'm sorry.
L250225 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. Think of how many fights you could have been in by now.
L250224 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ --You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
L250223 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
L250222 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ --Maybe I don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people.
L250221 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.
L250220 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Then don't set up any more meetings.
L250219 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.
L250218 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.
L250217 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
L250216 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ It's right.  Take it home with you.
L250215 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ That's fine, but did you ever think--
L250214 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Can I ask you a favor, can we do this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me--
L250213 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I'm pretty sure it's right.
L250212 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ --This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
L250211 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I don't know what it's called.
L250210 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--
L249830 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Will, this is Sean Maguire. Sean, Will Hunting.
L249829 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No.
L249750 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ That's enough.
L249749 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.
L249748 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Get out, Will.
L249747 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
L249746 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ I told you to cooperate with these people.
L249745 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun.
L249744 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Oh, for God's sake, Will.
L249728 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yeah, when do I get my hypnosis? You guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.
L249727 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Shall we start the, uh...
L249725 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ An integer.
L249724 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ --That edge!
L249723 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ --Half-red, half-black--
L249722 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ --that?--
L249721 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Half-red, half-black--
L249720 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ What's that?
L249718 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ I happen to know so.
L249717 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I think so.
L249716 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ That would be a monumental waste of time, wouldn't it, Will?
L249715 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ It's an integer proof.
L249714 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Okay. How?
L249713 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Of course.
L249712 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ This rectangle is subdivided into rectangles. One edge of an inner rectangle is an integer. Can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer?
L249672 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, Will.  I've already spoken to one therapist, his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a friend of mine. He's also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field.  I'm sure it'll be better than spending the next six months in jail.
L249671 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
L249670 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ That's right.
L249669 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ If I agree to this, I walk right now?
L249668 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ That you meet with me twice a week--
L249667 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What're those?
L249666 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Yes. Under two conditions.
L249665 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Really?
L249664 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
L249663 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Fuck do you want?
L249662 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.
L249560 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Well... I'll be speaking to your supervisor.
L249559 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Hey fuck you.
L249558 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ What's your name?  Don't you walk away from me. This is people's work, you can't graffiti here.
L249557 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L249556 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ What're you doing?
L249555 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry.
L249494 +++$+++ u5617 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ STUDENT +++$+++ Who proved the theorem.
L249493 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Find out what?
L249492 +++$+++ u5617 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ STUDENT +++$+++ I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
L249491 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ It's Saturday.
L249490 +++$+++ u5617 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ STUDENT +++$+++ I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
L249489 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Yes.
L249488 +++$+++ u5617 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ STUDENT +++$+++ Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?
L250119 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ I did.
L250118 +++$+++ u5619 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ TIMMY +++$+++ So who won the bet?
L250117 +++$+++ u5619 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ TIMMY +++$+++ No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
L250116 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard of him?
L250115 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ You've heard of Albert Einstein?
L250114 +++$+++ u5619 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ TIMMY +++$+++ Yeah, cured polio.
L250113 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
L250112 +++$+++ u5619 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ TIMMY +++$+++ Uh-oh.
L250111 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us? We're trying to settle a bet.
L250091 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Pleasure to meet you.
L250090 +++$+++ u5619 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ TIMMY +++$+++ Good to meet you.
L250504 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ About thirty million to one.
L250503 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
L250502 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ About thirty million to one.
L250501 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
L250500 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?
L250499 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Sounds good.
L250498 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ How about one now?
L250495 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ You should come. I'll buy you a drink.
L250494 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ I got one of those too.
L250493 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
L250492 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Do you know when you'll be back?
L250491 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Never been.
L250490 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Why there?
L250489 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I don't know. India maybe.
L250488 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Where're you going?
L250487 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
L250486 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ So I hear you're taking some time.
L250485 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Me too.
L250484 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Sean...
L250483 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Come in.
L250482 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Hello, Sean.
L250388 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ He's not you!
L250387 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
L250386 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ If you push him into something, if you ride him--
L250385 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ He won't be a failure!
L250384 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
L250383 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
L250382 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ --I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on!
L250381 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ --Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy--
L250380 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
L250379 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
L250378 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ --I don't have any anger at you--
L250377 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ --Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had.
L250376 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ --I'm not angry at you--
L250375 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--
L250374 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ --And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!
L250373 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Oh, that's nice--
L250372 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ --And why does he hang out with his friends? Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. It's called loyalty!
L250371 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Oh, come on, Sean--
L250370 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!
L250369 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.
L250368 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
L250367 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ What problems does he have, Sean, that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with--
L250366 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ He is at a fragile point. He's got problems--
L250365 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--
L250364 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ "Undermine?"
L250363 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- I don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
L250362 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
L250361 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ --Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
L250360 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Hold on!
L250359 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ --And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake--
L250358 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ --Gerry--
L250357 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ --And confuse him--
L250356 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Now wait a minute--
L250355 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ This is a disaster! I brought you in here to help me with this boy, not to run him out--
L250136 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ That's a wonderful theory, Sean. It worked wonders for you.
L250135 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
L250134 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
L250133 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ --Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
L250132 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ --No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
L250131 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Now wait a minute, Gerry--
L250130 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Sean, this is important. And it's above personal rivalry--
L250129 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Maybe he doesn't care about that.
L250128 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
L250127 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Just...take it easy, Gerry.
L250126 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Well, you're the only one.
L250125 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I do.
L250124 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ You see, Sean? That's exactly not the point. No one remembers that. They--
L250123 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Einstein. Had two marriages, both train-wrecks. The guy never saw his kids, one of whom, I think, ended up in an asylum--
L250122 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Who?
L250121 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ He married his cousin.
L250110 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ What don't I understand?
L250109 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Sean, I really don't think you understand--
L250108 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
L250107 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
L250106 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Jobs doing what?
L250105 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
L250104 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
L250103 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I think so.
L250102 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Seems like it's going well.
L250101 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I been here a couple years.
L250100 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ You moved?
L250099 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I live right around the corner.
L250098 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ You're here quite a bit, then.
L250089 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Timmy this is Gerry, an old friend of mine. We went to college together.
L250088 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Not at all.
L250087 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?
L249934 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I won't talk first.
L249933 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"
L249932 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
L249931 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Why would he do that?
L249930 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually.
L249929 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ What do you mean "he didn't talk?" You sat there for an hour?
L249834 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ You too, Gerry.
L249833 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Tom.
L249832 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Would you excuse us?
L249828 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ It's a poker game with this young man. Don't let him see what you've got.
L249827 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I'll be okay.
L249826 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Any vulnerability he senses, he'll exploit.
L249824 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ It's on the college.
L249823 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I got it.
L249822 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ That would be fine.
