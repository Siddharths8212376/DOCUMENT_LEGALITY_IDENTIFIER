L299369 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Tomorrow I'll steal you another.
L299368 +++$+++ u1455 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ ELSA +++$+++ But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
L299367 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ It would make me very happy.
L299366 +++$+++ u1455 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ ELSA +++$+++ In that case, I permit you.
L299365 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ I usually don't either.
L299364 +++$+++ u1455 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ ELSA +++$+++ I usually don't.
L299363 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Fraulein -- will you permit me?
L299362 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
L299361 +++$+++ u1455 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ ELSA +++$+++ The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
L299356 +++$+++ u1455 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ ELSA +++$+++ Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
L299355 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
L299353 +++$+++ u1455 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ ELSA +++$+++ I knew it was you --
L299352 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Yes?
L299351 +++$+++ u1455 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ ELSA +++$+++ Doctor Jones?
L300012 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Yes, sir!  Haaa!
L300011 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ After you, Junior.
L300010 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L300007 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Ready.
L300006 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Ready?
L300002 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ We named the dog Indiana.
L300001 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ I like Indiana.
L299998 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Junior?! Dad...
L299997 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What did you find, Junior?
L299996 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Me?... Illumination.
L299995 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ What did you find, Dad?
L299994 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.
L299989 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
L299988 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
L299945 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ "J".
L299944 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I".
L299932 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ The penitent man is humble...
L299931 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Penitent. Penitent...
L299930 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ The penitent man is humble before God.
L299929 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ The penitent man. The penitent...
L299928 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
L299927 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ "Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."
L299920 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Junior...
L299919 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Dad?!
L299894 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Get out of there, Dad!
L299893 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ You call this archaeology?
L299892 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Dad?
L299849 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation.
L299848 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Now, who are all these people?
L299839 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Dad, we're well out of range.
L299838 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
L299810 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ This could be close.
L299809 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ This is intolerable!
L299808 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ It happens to me all the time.
L299807 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ It's a new experience for me.
L299806 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ I know, Dad!
L299805 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Those people are trying to kill us!
L299804 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Thanks.
L299803 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Nice landing.
L299801 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
L299800 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Dad, are we hit?!
L299798 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What happens at eleven o'clock?
L299797 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Dad -- eleven o'clock!!
L299794 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Fly... yes. Land... no.
L299793 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I didn't know you could fly a plane.
L299789 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I don't know. We'll find out.
L299788 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ What does that mean?
L299787 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
L299786 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Well... I can't think of anything.
L299784 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Very well. I'm here now.
L299783 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Dad, how can you?
L299782 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ You left just when you were becoming interesting.
L299781 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
L299780 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.
L299779 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ When?
L299778 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Actually, I was a wonderful father.
L299777 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
L299776 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ And do I detect a rebuke?
L299775 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ We didn't talk. We never talked.
L299774 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Hmmm... What did we talk about?
L299773 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
L299772 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Ships that pass in the night...
L299771 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ I was the next man.
L299770 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Well, I'm as human as the next man.
L299769 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!
L299768 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
L299752 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Relax.
L299751 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.
L299749 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Good.
L299748 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
L299747 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What did you get?
L299734 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Oh yes, she did. Only too well. Unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all I could do was mourn her.
L299733 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
L299732 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?
L299731 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
L299730 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Marcus would agree with me.
L299729 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ What about Marcus?
L299728 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
L299727 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
L299726 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
L299725 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ But what are they? Can't you remember?
L299724 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
L299723 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Booby traps?
L299722 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Three devices of such lethal cunning.
L299721 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ What final challenge?
L299720 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
L299719 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ All right Dad -- tell me.
L299718 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ There is more in the Diary than just the map.
L299717 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
L299716 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ My Diary's in Berlin.
L299715 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Brody's this way.
L299714 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
L299713 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Stop! Stop!
L299712 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ What?
L299711 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Stop!
L299707 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
L299706 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Come on, Dad. Come on!
L299702 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ ...the solution presents itself.
L299701 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Dad!
L299695 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ I'm out, Dad!
L299694 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ This is intolerable!
L299687 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Oh.
L299686 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Head for the fireplace!
L299685 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What?
L299684 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Dad!
L299683 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What?
L299682 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Dad!
L299681 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What?
L299680 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Dad!
L299675 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.
L299674 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ And the chair.
L299673 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ What???
L299672 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ The floor's on fire! See?!
L299671 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
L299670 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I ought to tell you something.
L299668 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Try and burn through the ropes.
L299667 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Feels like a cigarette lighter.
L299666 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ My lucky charm.
L299665 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What am I looking for?
L299663 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Are you kidding? -- I made that up! You know Marcus -- he got lost once in his own museum!
L299662 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
L299661 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
L299660 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ So did I.
L299659 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
L299598 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ She talks in her sleep.
L299597 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ How did you she was a Nazi?
L299596 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Umh?
L299595 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?
L299587 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Don't worry. He won't.
L299586 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ No! Don't Shoot!
L299571 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior??
L299570 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ I came here to save you.
L299569 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
L299568 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Will you take it easy!
L299567 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
L299566 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Look, can we discuss this later?
L299565 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ You did!!
L299564 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Well, uh...
L299563 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ You didn't, did you?  You didn't bring it, did you?
L299554 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Yeah?
L299553 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ They want my diary.
L299552 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
L299551 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Rats?
L299550 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ There were rats, Dad.
L299549 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ If only I could have been with you.
L299548 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
L299547 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ ...you did it.
L299546 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior...
L299545 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
L299544 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
L299543 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Well, what was left of him.
L299542 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ He was actually there? You saw him?
L299541 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Found it.
L299540 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I knew it. And the tomb of Sir Richard?
L299539 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Right.
L299538 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Through the library?
L299537 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
L299536 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it.
L299534 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Good point.
L299533 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Dad, they come in through the doors.
L299532 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
L299531 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
L299529 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Thank God!
L299528 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Don't worry -- I'm fine.
L299527 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I'll never forgive myself --
L299526 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
L299525 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Oh, it breaks the heart.
L299523 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ I came to get you! What do you think?
L299522 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ But what are you doing here?
L299521 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Don't call me that, please.
L299520 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ It is you Junior!
L299246 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Junior!
L299245 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ No, Dad. You listen to me --
L299244 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Then wait -- count to twenty.
L299243 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ It's important!
L299242 +++$+++ u1456 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Out!
L299241 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Dad!
L299961 +++$+++ u1459 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ KNIGHT +++$+++ I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass it to you who vanquished me.
L299960 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
L299959 +++$+++ u1459 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ KNIGHT +++$+++ You're strangely dressed... for a knight.
L299958 +++$+++ u1459 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ KNIGHT +++$+++ A long time to wait.
L299957 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ That was seven hundred years ago.
L299956 +++$+++ u1459 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ KNIGHT +++$+++ The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
L299955 +++$+++ u1457 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ INDY +++$+++ Who are you?
L299954 +++$+++ u1459 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ KNIGHT +++$+++ I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.
L299876 +++$+++ u1460 +++$+++ m98 +++$+++ SALLAH +++$+++ They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
