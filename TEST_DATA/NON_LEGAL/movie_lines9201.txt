L337196 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Sit down!
L337195 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ The message!  I figured out--
L337156 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What?
L337155 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ You set yourself up tonight when you attacked Kathy, you crazy fuck!
L337060 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Get off me!
L337059 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Yes you are.
L337057 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ It's all a big game isn't it?  A sick, fuckin' game.  I don't know if there's two of you involved, or what -- but we're going to find out.  Last night you gave us just enough to send us to the wrong place.  It must've shocked the hell out to you when Frank walked in on Pine Road and you couldn't finish.
L337056 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
L337055 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ You're a lying bastard!
L337054 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'm positive.
L337053 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
L337052 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I was at the beach.
L337051 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ We're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there.
L336973 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Homesearchers.
L336972 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Then let's narrow it down.
L336929 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ If we knew that we'd know the answer to the riddle, wouldn't we?  He's telling us where he's going to kill tonight and we can't see it.
L336928 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Then what's he talking about?
L336927 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ He's not talking about himself.
L336920 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ There's a photostat of the original on the wall.
L336919 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No, I need the original note.
L336918 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ You got it on the board.
L336834 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.
L336833 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
L336832 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
L336831 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No.
L336830 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ You ever do any hunting, Peter?
L336829 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What do you want?
L336828 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Of course it was.  Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering.  That's a felony.
L336827 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No it wasn't.
L336826 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ The door was open.
L336825 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ How'd you get in here?
L336824 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
L336823 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I wouldn't know.
L336822 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?
L336745 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
L336744 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?
L336743 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Maybe you should.
L336742 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.
L336739 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You think you're going to catch him on a trace?  Everything he does is planned out well in advance.  The only way we're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up.
L336738 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ What in the hell do you think you're doing?  Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace.
L336728 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Let's see how much he wants to play.
L336727 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Are you crazy?
L336617 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Not what -- who.  Morpheus.  The Greek God of dreams.  Look at the next line. "Her God has gone and left his home."
L336616 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ What?
L336615 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Morpheus.
L336603 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ His victims aren't random.  It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.
L336602 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ All you gotta do is look at the map.
L336601 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
L336600 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ What do you mean, no?
L336599 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No.
L336598 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random.
L336436 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Oh, we'll be back.  You can bet on it.
L336435 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
L336434 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
L336433 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
L336432 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
L336431 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What's that supposed to mean?
L336427 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Fine, don't ask me out on a date.
L336426 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ You are!  I don't like you.
L336425 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
L336424 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
L336423 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Casual.
L336383 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What are you saying?
L336382 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
L336381 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What kind of problem?
L336380 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ We seem to have a little problem here?
L336373 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yes.
L336372 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ By yourself?
L336367 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.
L336366 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
L336980 +++$+++ u1709 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ What's the first street?
L336979 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.
L336978 +++$+++ u1709 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L336977 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway.
L336976 +++$+++ u1709 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ It'll take hours.  You can't make me do this.
L336975 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.
L336974 +++$+++ u1709 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ You want me to what?
L337179 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him.  Let him sweat for a little while.
L337178 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Ready for round two?
L337137 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's a voice modulator.
L337136 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ What is it?
L337008 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Find him!  I want to talk to him.
L337007 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I spoke to Jeremy.  He's watching Sanderson's kid.  Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.
L337006 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Sanderson?
L337005 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
L337004 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
L337003 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ You alright?
L337002 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
L337001 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ How is she?
L336613 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Maybe he's going to drug her?
L336612 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ We've checked.  There's no one with the last name of Emma on the Island.
L336576 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
L336575 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You still having a problem with this?
L336561 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Check with the State.  If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it.  Nolan?
L336560 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  I think he's a first- timer.
L336550 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Anything?
L336549 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Sorry.
L336444 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
L336443 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ No shit!
L336430 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
L336429 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Take it easy.  Both of you.
L336422 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What was your relationship with her?
L336421 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.
L336388 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying.
L336387 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ You think he's dirty?
L336386 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
L336385 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ What do you think?
L336329 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ No.  She just moved here last month from Portland.
L336328 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Local?
L336327 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Debi Rutlege.  Female.  Caucasian. Twenty four.  Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel.
L336326 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Run it down.
L336325 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank.
L337093 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
L337092 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ We'll find the evidence.
L337080 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. You've lost your perspective.  You can't possibly be unbiased.
L337079 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
L337078 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!
L337077 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Remember eventually revenge is carefully...  Have you tired juxtaposing the words?
L337048 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ He was with me?
L337047 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Don't fuck with us!  Where did you go!
L336926 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ But a hundred men could move him.
L336925 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
L336863 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ What was suspicious about him?
L336862 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
L336861 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
L336860 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ What do you mean, stand out?
L336859 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Did anyone stand out?
L336858 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ A few people.
L336579 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Maybe you're reaching a bit?  I think Sanderson should be in on this. There's a reason why the killer's calling him.
L336578 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
L336577 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
L336574 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ He's one of the best Chess players in the world.  Who better to play a game with?
L336573 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Why does he call Sanderson?
L336556 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?
L336555 +++$+++ u1698 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ You should be an actor, Frank.  You looked like you were really mad.  The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.
L337239 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You told me.  When you called you said she was in the other room.  Drop the knife.
L337238 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ How'd you know I wouldn't be in the same room with her?
L337235 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ The pipes.
L337234 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ Very good.  How did you know?
L337233 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I know where you are.
L337230 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No!  Wait!!
L337229 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ I was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die -- but I've decided it's better if you don't know exactly when I kill her. Good-bye Peter.
L337228 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ Don't beg, Peter.  She has to die.  I can't win unless she dies.
L337227 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
L337226 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
L337225 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  "His play is always fair and just."
L337224 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ No.  As usual you're wrong.  It is her I want.  Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.
L337223 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It's me you want.  Not her.
L337222 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ The game's over.  You lost.
L337221 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Please... wait.
L337220 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
L337219 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Let me speak to my daughter.
L337218 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.
L337217 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yes?
L337176 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ No you haven't.  And even if you had it doesn't matter.  Who would you tell? The police don't believe you, and you've just used your only phone call.
L337175 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I've figured out the message.
L337174 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ By that time the game will be over.
L337173 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
L337172 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ Emotional?  I expected more from you.
L337171 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You sonofabitch!
L337170 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ Hello, Peter.
L337076 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ --you're hopeless!  You can't even read a sentence!  Didn't they teach you punctuation in school?  The game ends tonight!
L337075 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- -
L337074 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ Interesting concept.  I hadn't thought of that.  If you think about how Anton Berger plays chess you might get it.
L337073 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ They think that you and I are doing this together.
L337072 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ The police haven't told you?
L337071 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What word did you leave last night?
L337070 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ I used a variation.  You should have anticipated that.  Have you figured out the message?
L337069 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You're next move should have been e2- e3.
L337068 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ Very good.
L337067 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
L337066 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ Last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  Have you figured out what I'm doing?
L337065 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Hello.
L336909 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ Very nice speech, Peter.  Did you rehearse that, or was it impromptu?  There's an old wooden bench in the garden.  Next to it is a rock.  You'll find a message for you under it.  Let's see if you're as clever as you think you are.
L336908 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It's you who's running out of time. You're starting to make mistakes now. You're wondering just how much I really know.  Just how close I'm getting? Well, I'm closer than you think, pal -- and I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall!
L336907 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ The game's almost over, Peter, and you're running out of time.
L336906 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
L336905 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ What makes you think I was there?
L336904 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
L336903 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ What?
L336900 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You like to brag, don't you?
L336899 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.
L336898 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
L336897 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ Have you any idea what the message is?
L336737 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ So is mine, within the framework of my rules.
L336736 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Huxley's quote also says, "his play is always fair and just."
L336735 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ I couldn't say it any better than Huxley.
L336734 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ How?
L336733 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
L336732 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ And you want these girls to feel your pain?
L336731 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ Pain?  Pain is just a state of mind. It's something you learn to live with. I have.
L336730 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Why are you doing this?  You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
L336729 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ Just for that no hint today.
L336726 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Then call them!
L336725 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.
L336723 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ You're not playing very well.  There are clues all around you and you keep missing them.
L336722 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'm just trying to play the game.
L336721 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me.  I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.
L336720 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Just like who?
L336719 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ I know what I said!  She looks just like...
