L424382 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ STOP CALLING ME THAT! MY NAME IS NOT DAVID, AND IF YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE, YOU'RE MORE FUCKED UP THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE!
L424381 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ David, please --
L424380 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
L424379 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What do you mean? What did I do to you...
L424378 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot.
L424369 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
L424368 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Why are you doing this to me?
L424367 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here.
L424366 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
L424355 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ In fact, I want you to ad lib, that's the magic I'm after. I wanna give a whole new feel to the show.
L424354 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Ad lib?
L424353 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Your lines are in the script, but you can ad lib.
L424325 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yes... maybe it was.
L424324 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
L424323 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
L424322 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
L424321 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
L424320 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ ...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
L424319 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
L424318 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
L424317 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ No, I mean your dedication scares me...
L424316 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
L424315 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I've never met anyone like you, Betty.
L424314 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No, I would have remembered that name. The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot.  Was this before Leslie? Before us?...
L424313 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Didn't I?
L424312 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
L424310 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Well, first I thought Patina, and then the Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic. Like my place.
L424309 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
L424308 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't think your friend likes me.
L424223 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I know. It's up to us.
L424222 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
L424221 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Of course.
L424220 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
L424219 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I just want everything to be perfect between us.
L424218 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
L424217 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
L424216 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What happened when you were twelve?
L424215 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.
L424214 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You told me that two hours ago.
L424213 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
L424212 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
L424211 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?
L424210 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
L424209 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yes, she is.
L424208 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Lyla's very nice.
L424184 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You're late, Eric.
L424183 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
L424182 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.
L424181 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I guess we all did.  You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you...
L424159 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
L424158 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Why do they keep calling you George?
L424155 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.
L424154 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You never gave us a chance...
L424153 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
L424152 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
L424148 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable!
L424147 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
L424146 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You knew Del?!
L424145 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
L424144 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No, Del.
L424143 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Oh, you mean Fred.
L424129 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ The day I left you I just drove and drove. I drove all day and all that night, and I didn't go anywhere. I just kept driving. I stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and I sat --
L424128 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ That's very kind of you.
L424127 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life.  We were thirteen days away from getting married and... I just got scared. It's a mistake I've had to live with for six years. But it's behind me now...  And I hope you can put it behind you. I've missed you... David.
L424126 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L424124 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ We were engaged.
L424123 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I take it I should. I'm sorry.
L424122 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ ...of course you do.  You don't remember me?
L424416 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ You sure don't. Who do you think you are coming to Hollywood, anyway? You should remember where you came from. And who you really are.
L424415 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I don't know.
L424414 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
L424413 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
L424412 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
L424411 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I came for love...
L424410 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
L423458 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ That is a skill!
L423457 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
L423456 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
L423454 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ They're new to us...
L423453 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
L423452 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
L423451 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Couple 'a guys in from outta town. They want to see the new LeSabres.
L423450 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
L423449 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ ...well, then you ain't got much.
L423448 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I got you, Del...
L423447 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?
L423446 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Or the vitamins? Or the...?
L423445 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ What?
L423444 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ ...like the water purifiers?
L423443 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential.
L423442 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
L423441 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
L423440 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
L423439 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
L423438 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Sure you don't want any salad?
L423396 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Nothing... it's, ahh, busy here. Look, you don't need a LeSabre to go out with Sue Ann. Take the blue Corsica. I'll see you when I get home.
L423395 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What was that?
L423393 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ What's so special about it?
L423392 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
L423391 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ I ran back in to get the phone.
L423390 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
L423389 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
L423388 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ So, call me when you --
L424471 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It's not really a good time, guys...
L424470 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Have you checked the trunk of that car you're driving, Betty? I think there might be...
L424466 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I woulda' been here sooner, but Ballard put me in jail. He still thinks you had Del scalped.
L424465 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Ahh, look, right now's not very...
L424464 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ You're in serious danger!
L424463 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Roy! What are you doing here?
L424462 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
L423588 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It was Chloe...
L423587 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ You did? Was it anyone that you...?
L423586 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Yes.
L423585 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ My God... did you get a look at who did it?
L423584 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
L423583 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
L423582 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What're you doing here, Roy?
L423581 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem...
L423580 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L423579 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Make sure it's elevated...
L423578 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
L423577 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
L423576 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
L423337 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Oh, appreciate it. I was trying to, ahh, give a sense of history to...
L423336 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
L423335 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
L423834 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ To tell you the truth, I can't believe I've made it this far. It may not be Europe, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
L423833 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
L423832 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.
L423831 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be there when I arrived...
L423830 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You made out alright.
L423829 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Worse.
L423828 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Like Rome?
L423827 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
L423826 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'll go to the Hospital.
L423825 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Piss off, Merle.  So how you gonna find him, Betty?
L423823 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.
L423822 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ You mean... George McCord, the actor?
L423821 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Dr. David Ravell.
L423820 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ What's his real name?
L423819 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ How did you know?
L423818 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
L423817 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No. Loma Vista.
L423816 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
L423815 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
L423814 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
L423813 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
L423812 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Really?
L423811 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I left my husband two days ago.
L423810 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ No, he was a toad. Even more of a toad than Merle... I just wear the ring to keep the flies away. Rome was the best thing I ever did, because I DID IT! And I swear to you, it changed me. I've been to Rome, Italy! I sat every morning at the Cafe Sistina and had my cappuccino, and watched the pilgrims walk to mass, and no one can ever take that away from me.
L423809 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ That's horrible!
L423808 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage --
L423807 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Sure I loved it! It was great.
L423806 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Did you love it?
L423805 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
L423804 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
L423803 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
L423802 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Los Angeles, California.
L423801 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Where you headed, Betty?
L423800 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ I'd kick him in the nuts, if I thought he had any.
L423799 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'd slap his face.
L423798 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
L423786 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.

L423778 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...
L423777 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ So you're into "Reason," too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you?
L423776 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.
L423775 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I begged him to let me put that on!
L423774 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ What's the matter here?
L424388 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ ...did I win some contest?
L424387 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ She called you 'George,' George.

L424138 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?

L424133 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ I'm Lyla Branch. I'm the Producer.
L424132 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
L424131 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
L424456 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
L424455 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ These guys are here to help you, Betty.
L424435 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Okay, okay, look, ummm... Let's just talk a little first and you'll feel better, I promise.
L424434 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
L424433 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
L424432 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
L424431 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ What?! That you had something to do with it?
L424429 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...
L424428 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Your husband?!
L424427 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
L424426 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run out of here... You need to talk about what's going on...
L424425 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I have to leave now.
L424424 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Where are you going?

L424307 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Oh, he does that.  It's this silly game he plays. Half the people who know him call him George.
L424306 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
L424305 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Rosa, so you've met David?
L424301 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ All the time. It's always "Loma Vista" this, "Loma Vista" that.
L424300 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
L424299 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You should have a little faith in people.
L424298 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
