L370995 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
L370994 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
L370993 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Crabapple Cove. Maine.
L370992 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
L370991 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
L370990 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
L370989 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Make it yourself, or is it real?
L370988 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ I got some.
L370987 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
L370986 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ You got directions?
L370985 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Duke Forrest.
L370984 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
L371435 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I can't... couldn't.
L371434 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ Wait a second...
L371433 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Don't stop now! Please...
L371432 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ Frank...
L371421 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
L371420 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
L371419 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
L371418 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Godless buffoons, all of them.
L371400 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ Anyway, we want to get this letter off.
L371399 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
L371398 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ Ravenous. What about you?
L371397 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
L371396 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ We think the same way.
L371395 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We're a good team.
L371394 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ I think it's a marvelous letter.
L371393 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ I don't mind. If we give them something to talk about.
L371392 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ People will talk.
L371391 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ I have a tent to myself.
L371390 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
L371389 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ There's no point appealing to Colonel Blake. They've got him bewitched.
L371448 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
L371447 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I was just asking...
L371131 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ ...And for our Supreme Commander over here and our Commander-in-Chief in Washington.
L371130 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
L371129 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ ...And for our young men on the field of battle, that they may return home to their dear ones...
L371122 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ ...trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against...
L371121 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
L371120 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Give us this day our daily...
L371106 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
L371105 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Is that liquor?
L371828 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ Damn right. Three to one, as much as you want to put up.
L371827 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ You willing to b-back that up with odds?
L371826 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you!
L371782 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ N-n-no thanks, G-General.
L371781 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
L371780 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ But what about Major Houlihan?
L371779 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
L371778 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ A football game?
L371777 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.
L371759 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry?  Thanks for the drink, boys.
L371758 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
L371757 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
L371756 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I think I heard about that.
L371755 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
L371754 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.
L371746 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Neither does Henry Blake. But I'll tell you what makes him the best C.O. you've got in any of your hospitals. He leaves all the medical decisions to the men who do the day- to-day work and understand what meatball surgery is.
L371745 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.
L371744 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ And there it is.
L371743 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ So if it ain't staring us in the face, it's got to be retroperitoneal. And that, along with the look of the wounds, makes me figure he's got a hole in his sigmoid colon that we won't find unless we look for it.
L371742 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ Right.
L371741 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
L371740 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.
L371739 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Now, General, I'm going to sandbag you. Do you think we're ready to get out of this belly?
L371735 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ There's nothing to talk about, General. You take the case yourself or join me at three o'clock. Either way you're liable to learn something.
L371734 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ I want to talk to you, Pierce.
L371733 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not.
L371726 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You betcher ass, General.
L371725 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ Pierce! That soldier requires immediate attention. I'm a surgeon and I know.
L371722 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ What?
L371721 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You betcher ass, Dad.
L371720 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
L371719 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Gimme three.
L371837 +++$+++ u2031 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ RADAR +++$+++ All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
L371836 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Radar!
L371685 +++$+++ u2031 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ RADAR +++$+++ I found a doner.
L371684 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I though you said we didn't have a drop.
L371683 +++$+++ u2031 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ RADAR +++$+++ A-negative. I've cross-matched it.
L371453 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Also I'm curious whether she's a moaner or...
L371452 +++$+++ u2031 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ RADAR +++$+++ Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
L371451 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
L371895 +++$+++ u2029 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT +++$+++ Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.
L371894 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
L371893 +++$+++ u2029 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT +++$+++ C-A-M-E-M...?
L371892 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
L371891 +++$+++ u2029 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT +++$+++ We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
L371890 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ What for?
L371802 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Not necessarily.
L371801 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
L371774 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ He can move in here with us.
L371773 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
L371772 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.
L371771 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ So what makes you think he'll play for us?
L371768 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him.
L371767 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ He only lasted one season.
L371763 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.
L371762 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ But he's got five times the man-power to draw on.
L371709 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ They're coming.
L371708 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?
L371682 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Sure, that's the right way... at John Hopkins or someplace. But how do we know there won't be even more of a jam-up a few days from now? Maybe we won't be able to get to him when we want to. Maybe the goddam thing'll erode the artery when nobody's looking. Our best shot is now.
L371681 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
L371680 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
L371679 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ What do we do?
L371678 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.
L371677 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I don't get it.
L371676 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
L371675 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Oh, Jesus.
L371674 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I don't feel anything.
L371671 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ If we don't get that pint, he's in trouble.
L371670 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
L371669 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
L371668 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
L371667 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.
L371666 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
L371665 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ If we squeeze him through, I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College.
L371661 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a shell in your chest, but we'll take it out as soon as you've had more blood. Hey, Radar!
L371660 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Christ, it's Ho-Jon!
L371657 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Yeah, and he's lost a lot of blood. I'm afraid it's hit more that just the lung.
L371656 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ It's in pretty deep.
L371655 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Okay, but I'll need you to help. Duke, will you take that belly back there? The Australian?
L371654 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ For you, Trapper.
L371648 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Radar!
L371647 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.
L371592 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Like the Rock of Gibraltar.
L371591 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Is he out?
L371566 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ What's the age of consent in this country?
L371565 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
L371564 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
L371557 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ When you make up your mind, get in touch. The golf club is probably the best place to leave a message.
L371556 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
L371555 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Please!  Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal.
L371529 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Well, he wouldn't score more than once in seven or eight tries, but the important thing was he didn't waste time socializing. Anyway, Trapper John, this is Me Lay.
L371528 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
L371527 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
L371512 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Just like we thought, it's a routine problem. Nurse, who's in charge of operating room preparations?
L371511 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Don't worry, son. That's Captain McIntyre, and he's the best chest surgeon in the Far East and maybe in the whole U.S. Army. He'll fix you up fine. Your daddy saw to that.
L371498 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive.
L371497 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Look.
L371495 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ So let's haul ass, Sergeant.
L371494 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ But besides the operation, we've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf.
L371490 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?
L371489 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle.
L371486 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ 'Course it isn't, but how many chances do we get to go to Japan? With our golf clubs.
L371485 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I'm not so sure the goddam thing's in his heart.
L371474 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ As far as the greens maybe. I don't know if my putting would come back or not, without some practice.
L371473 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up.
L371417 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Oh, you want to play it straight?  I guess I owe you an apology.
L371416 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ No, no, that one.
L371415 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
L371304 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish.
L371303 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ It's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs.
L371298 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You want it straight? Medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving.
L371297 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ We stand behind all our work.
L371281 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ An eternal damnation.
L371280 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.
L371273 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ The Painless Pole plans to cross the Great Divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out.
L371272 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ We're throwing him a Last Supper. We came to invite you.
L371263 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
L371262 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Black capsule.
L371218 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
L371217 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ ...But I turned in my knee pads.
L371201 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.
L371200 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ What are they peeking at? Captain Waldowski in the shower?
L371193 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?
L371192 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.
L371188 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ I like an olive.
L371187 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
L371183 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
L371182 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
L371711 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ No, thank you. I'm not the slightest bit interested.
L371710 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Hey, Knocko, I got those pictures you promised to look at of my kids. You too, Wilma. It won't take a minute.  You can see them too, if you want.
L371387 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Sister, if I knew the answer to that I sure as hell wouldn't be here.
L371386 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.
L371385 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.
L371384 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
L371383 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
L371382 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
L371381 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
L371380 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army.
L371379 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
L371378 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ Major Burns is far from satisfied.
L371377 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ That's right. We work well together.
L371376 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ All of them?
L371375 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
L371374 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. But naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine.
L371373 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
L371372 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
L371884 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Hang in there.
L371883 +++$+++ u2033 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SPEARCHUCKER +++$+++ It's possible
L371882 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ See you.
L371831 +++$+++ u2033 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SPEARCHUCKER +++$+++ We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.
L371830 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ What's the matter?
L371798 +++$+++ u2033 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SPEARCHUCKER +++$+++ No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
L371797 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
L371796 +++$+++ u2033 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SPEARCHUCKER +++$+++ I think we could still have a chance.
L371795 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ The bastards outconned us.
L371790 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I'm thinking about how we can make more money.  Suppose we bet only part of our dough and keep this big animal out of the game the whole first half and let them roll up some points. Then you could bet the rest of our bundle between the halves and get the General and his friends to give us some real odds.
L371789 +++$+++ u2033 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SPEARCHUCKER +++$+++ Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
L371788 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?
