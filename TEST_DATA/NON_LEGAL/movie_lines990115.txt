L376710 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No.
L376709 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
L376708 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
L376707 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Well, they're mine now.
L376706 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Those were my words, Bill.
L376705 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
L376704 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ So that's what love is?
L376703 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
L376702 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Which is what?
L376701 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.
L376700 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Then what is it?
L376699 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
L376698 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
L376697 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
L376696 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm sorry, Bill --
L376695 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You're not taking Susan anywhere. And what the hell does that mean anyway?
L376694 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I think you heard me, Bill.
L376693 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You're what?
L376692 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight.
L376691 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Say again?
L376690 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ -- And I'm in love with your daughter.
L376689 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You 'want to know', I'll tell you. You're looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, he's galloping into it.  And the same time, the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates.  And, oh yes, I almost forgot, my daughter's fallen in love with Death.
L376688 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I was just asking, Bill.
L376687 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What the hell do you care?
L376686 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Not at all.
L376685 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Thanks.
L376588 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Good.  Tomorrow, after the party.
L376587 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Yeah.
L376586 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You are?
L376585 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What are you saying, that it's time to go?
L376584 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ -- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
L376583 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Yes?
L376582 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Uh --
L376525 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I told you, 'watch it'.
L376524 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
L376523 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.
L376522 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ And I don't give a shit.
L376521 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
L376520 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
L376519 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ This universe?
L376518 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You're violating the laws of the universe.
L376515 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I picked you for your verve, your excellence, and for your ability to - how shall I say - instruct.  You've lived a first-rate life.  And I find it eminently usable.
L376514 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --
L376513 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ 'Spooning'?
L376512 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
L376511 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
L376510 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I'm her father!
L376509 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'll be the judge of that.
L376508 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
L376507 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes, I saw you see me.
L376505 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm sorry to hear that.
L376504 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I couldn't sleep.
L376478 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Then I can't help you.
L376477 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm not hungry.
L376476 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Never mind.  I'm tired.  I'm going to take a nap.
L376475 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ 'Fish'?
L376474 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over.  We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?
L376473 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Just a manner of speaking.
L376472 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What's okay?
L376471 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ That's okay.
L376470 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm sorry, Bill --
L376425 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Goodnight.
L376424 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Okay.  Goodnight.
L376423 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Um -- not right now.
L376422 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
L376421 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Hello, Bill.
L376289 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Are you going to fire me, Bill?
L376288 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.
L376287 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You tell me, Bill.
L376286 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What way would you put it?
L376285 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I wouldn't put it that way.
L376284 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ About Susan?
L376283 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I guess...
L376282 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You were just curious?
L376281 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I don't know.
L376280 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Why did you go to the hospital?
L376176 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Easy, Bill.  You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.
L376175 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
L376174 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Okay.
L376173 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
L376172 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
L376170 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Absolutely.
L376169 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Dinner?  Absolutely.
L376152 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ This part I'm interested in.
L376151 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I thought you'd heard a trillion times --
L376150 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Well...I don't know.
L376149 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Why didn't you stop me?
L376148 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ And more.
L376147 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken.  She knew stuff like that.
L376146 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L376145 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
L376144 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Truly - uh - splendid.
L376143 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A little Coleman's mustard.
L376142 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Excellent.  What is it?
L376141 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ It's all yours.
L376140 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Are you going to eat your lunch
L376079 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.
L376078 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.
L376075 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh.  Okay.
L376074 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Now I'd like to be alone.
L376073 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Of course.
L376072 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something.  I know I'll be seeing you.
L376071 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?
L376070 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
L376069 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Are you sad, Bill?
L376068 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ ...I'd like to be alone for a while.
L376067 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I don't understand.
L376066 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ -- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
L376040 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes.
L376039 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Would you like to sit down, Joe?
L376028 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
L376027 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
L376026 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No.
L376025 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
L376016 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ So can I.
L376015 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Yes.
L376014 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Can you keep a secret?
L376013 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What's it like where I'm going?
L376012 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L376011 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What's it like?
L376010 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I understand.
L376009 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I want to live.
L376008 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ That's what everybody says.
L376007 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I'm not everybody.
L376006 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ That's what everybody says.
L376005 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ -- I don't deserve this.  I'm still young, this is not my time --
L376004 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Not this.
L376003 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ There's one to every rule.
L376002 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Make an exception?
L376001 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ How about giving a guy a break?
L376000 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes, Bill.
L375999 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Joe --?
L375998 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ So you've grasped the idea.  Con- gratulations.  Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
L375997 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Of course.
L375996 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
L375995 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I guess so.
L375994 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
L375993 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What do you mean?
L375992 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?
L375989 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You've got a deal.
L375988 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Yes?
L375987 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Bill --
L375986 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You give your word, I give mine -- that we'll do what we say.  It's a truth exchanged between two people.
L375985 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ A 'deal'?
L375984 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ It is a deal?
L375983 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Sounds fair enough.
L375982 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ And I won't tell anyone who you are.
L375981 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ And what?
L375979 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we had last night.  I felt as if I were being treated like a person.  'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly.
L375978 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
L375977 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ 'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
L375976 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ How are you?  How're you feeling?
L375975 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Good morning, Bill.
L375974 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Good morning.
L375922 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Good night to you, Bill.
L375921 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
L375920 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Not at all.
L375919 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Well, thank you for letting me know.
L375918 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Closer than that.
L375917 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
L375916 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ No --
L375915 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
L375914 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ ...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
L375913 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
L375912 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ When you go, I go.
L375911 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
L375910 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ How long have I got?
L375909 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I won't.
L375908 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ If there is anything else, don't hesitate --
L375907 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No.
L375906 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
L375905 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What a good idea.
L375902 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for?
L375901 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
L375900 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No.
L375899 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ So there's nothing between you and Susan?
L375898 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I didn't know her.  The body I took knew her.  The man she met in the coffee shop this morning.  I - uh - took him.
L375897 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Shook me up.  I mean that you knew her and everything --
L375896 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ 'Threw' you?  Where?
L375895 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ ...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
L375891 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Thank you.
L375890 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Joe, that's the kitchen.

L375846 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No --
L375811 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Then don't.
L375810 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
L375809 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Speak up, please.
L375808 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ It just occurred to me --
L375807 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Of course.
L375806 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Excuse me?  Could I say something?
L375805 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family.  And that's what we're doing.  It's not open for discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't you understand?
L375804 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.
L375801 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ And then --?
L375800 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ You should hope quite a while.
L375799 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I do?  How long will you be staying?
L375798 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ You fill the bill, Bill.
L375797 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You want me to be your guide --?
L375796 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ The jacket and the pair of pants came with the body I took.  Let me ask your opinion.  Do I blend in?
L375795 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
L375794 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ That's me.
