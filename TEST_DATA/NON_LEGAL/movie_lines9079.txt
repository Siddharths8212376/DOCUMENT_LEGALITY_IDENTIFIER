L234078 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ What?
L234077 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.
L234074 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.
L234073 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ She's great. Gimme the money.
L234069 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ In the can. That the money?
L234068 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Where's Karen?
L234047 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Gimme an hour.
L234046 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
L234045 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I'll find it.
L234044 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ You know Laurel Canyon?
L234043 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ Okay. Fine. The meantime, I'll just hang on to her for safe keeping.
L234042 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
L234041 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ That's a nice scream, lady. You oughta be in movies.
L234040 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ She can't talk right now.
L234039 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Karen? You okay?
L234038 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ Three.
L234037 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I don't believe this.
L234036 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ In just a second. Two...
L234035 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
L234034 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ How 'bout I give you to three, then I organize your fuckin' brains all over the wall back there. One...
L234033 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ Tell you what...
L234032 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked up your organization is.
L234030 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you?
L234029 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
L234028 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ What money?
L234027 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ I need the money.
L233498 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know.
L233497 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ I really think I can be of service on this one.
L233495 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ That's all.
L233494 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ That's all there is to it, huh?
L233493 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
L233492 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ You know how to write one of these?
L233490 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ She's been out of movies a few years, but she's good. Real good.
L233489 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ Who?
L233488 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
L233487 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
L233486 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ She's... young.
L233485 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
L233484 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Get something going there.
L233483 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ What about her?
L233482 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ There's Ilona.
L233481 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ I'm with you on that. And don't you think it needs a good female part? Increase the romance angle.
L233480 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Title's the first thing's got to go. And the guy's name. I mean, even this writer's name, Murray Saffrin is better than "Lovejoy".
L233479 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ So what? Where's it say in this script he's white? Color is what the part needs, man, somebody to do it has some style. The way it is now, Ronnie could do it, play himself, some cracked out asshole.  So whatta you think of the script?
L233478 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy.
L233477 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
L233476 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
L233475 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
L233474 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
L233473 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
L233472 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Yeah, we're getting Martin.
L233471 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ Says here you're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy.
L233470 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ That's right, me.
L233469 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ You must bring something heavy to the deal.
L233468 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ It's what he said, I'm his associate.
L233467 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ Harry called you his associate, but what does that mean? I never heard your name or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace.
L233466 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit.
L233465 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ I'm just explaining to you what I'm doing here. Case you think I come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has.
L233464 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
L233463 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
L233323 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ That's what I thought. So let me put it this way...
L233322 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ You can talk to me.
L233321 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?
L233320 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Harry, let me answer that.
L233319 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ What's this movie you're doing first?
L233694 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ That's the magic number.
L233693 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ C-18.
L233691 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ It's not the kind of thing you do.
L233690 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I don't know.
L233689 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ It was waiting out there on another deal, one that didn't go through; one you don't want to know about.
L233688 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ The airport.
L233687 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
L233686 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
L233684 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Leo, I don't know.
L233683 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
L233671 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ We'll talk about that, Harry. But first I gotta know, how'd you hook up with Chili Palmer.
L233670 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
L233669 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
L233668 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ All I want in return is to work on the movie with you. Fact I already got some ideas on how to fix it up.
L233667 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You serious?
L233666 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ Listen, Harry, how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand? You pay me back at your convenience, no interest.
L233655 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ Yeah, I was wondering why he should do that.
L233654 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Chili Palmer showed you my script?
L233653 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.
L233651 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Boy, this town. Word gets around, doesn't it?
L233650 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
L233649 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I'm working on a few things.
L233648 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
L233647 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people –-
L233330 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ It's a different kind of deal.
L233329 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ You positive about that?
L233328 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I can't do it.
L233327 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of "Freaks" and put 'em in this other one, "Mr. Loverboy".
L233863 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ What I'm sayin' is the man wants his money and he wants it now.
L233862 +++$+++ u1083 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
L233861 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account.
L233332 +++$+++ u1083 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ By Friday, man, or you're fuckin' dead as disco.
L233331 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ Okay. Then be good enough to hand us our money back, or you think about us coming in on this new one.
L233306 +++$+++ u1083 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Yeah, where've you been? We haven't heard from you lately.
L233305 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ What I been wondering is where's he been.
L233304 +++$+++ u1083 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?
L233870 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ That's correct. Look at me.
L233869 +++$+++ u1070 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ You say look at you?
L233868 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Look at me, Ray.
L233867 +++$+++ u1070 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ What?
L233866 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Ray. Look at me.
L233865 +++$+++ u1070 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
L233758 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Or else use your fucking imagination.
L233757 +++$+++ u1070 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Or else what?
L233756 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else.
L233755 +++$+++ u1070 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here?
L233754 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Maybe that's because you've never been out've fuckin' Miami, dipshit. Maybe it's time you got on a plane, flew out to L.A. and took a meeting with Mr. Zimm.
L233753 +++$+++ u1070 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Never heard of him.
L233752 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
L233751 +++$+++ u1070 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Who?
L233750 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
L233749 +++$+++ u1070 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Okay. So who are you?
L233748 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
L233747 +++$+++ u1070 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
L233746 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Hello? You there?
L233745 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ The three hundred grand a guy named Leo Devoe scammed off an airline. The three hundred grand Chili Palmer now has in his possession.
L233744 +++$+++ u1070 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ What three hundred grand?
L233743 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
L233742 +++$+++ u1070 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Depends. Who's this?
L233741 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
L233740 +++$+++ u1070 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Who is this?
L233739 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Ray Barboni?
L234131 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Whatever you want, Ray.
L234130 +++$+++ u1070 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before -– I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was -– forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?
L234129 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I like it here.
L234128 +++$+++ u1070 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
L234127 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Sovereign.
L234126 +++$+++ u1070 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Yeah? Which terminal?
L234125 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I checked the bag at the airport, when I came.
L234119 +++$+++ u1070 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ 'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.
L234118 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Why would I do that?
L234115 +++$+++ u1070 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
L234114 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
L234113 +++$+++ u1070 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
L234112 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ How'd you get in here?
L233892 +++$+++ u1083 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time.
L233891 +++$+++ u1070 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that.
L233889 +++$+++ u1070 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city.
L233888 +++$+++ u1083 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
L233887 +++$+++ u1070 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ I don't like waiting.
L233886 +++$+++ u1083 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Get in line, bro.
L233885 +++$+++ u1070 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ He owes me money.
L233884 +++$+++ u1083 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.
L233883 +++$+++ u1083 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ What, like that's supposed to mean something to me?
L233882 +++$+++ u1070 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Ray Barboni. From Miami.
L233881 +++$+++ u1083 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Who the fuck are you?
L233800 +++$+++ u1072 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CURTIS +++$+++ Get him out've here.
L233799 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
L233798 +++$+++ u1072 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CURTIS +++$+++ That's the idea. I'll think about it.
L233797 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
L233796 +++$+++ u1072 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CURTIS +++$+++ Something shouldn't be there.
L233795 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
L233794 +++$+++ u1072 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CURTIS +++$+++ By the way, you recall the number of the locker you used?
L233792 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here.
L233791 +++$+++ u1072 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CURTIS +++$+++ Your wife a Lakers fan?
L233780 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Not yet. I just started.
L233779 +++$+++ u1072 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CURTIS +++$+++ You have a card in here?
L233778 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I'm a producer.
L233777 +++$+++ u1072 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CURTIS +++$+++ You're an investor, is that it?
L233776 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I'm in the movie business.
L233775 +++$+++ u1072 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CURTIS +++$+++ What're you doing in Los Angeles?
L233774 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ That's right.
L233773 +++$+++ u1072 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CURTIS +++$+++ You live in Miami?
L233082 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Movie producer? Yeah, why not.
L233081 +++$+++ u1073 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.
L233080 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ What've you got?
L233079 +++$+++ u1073 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
