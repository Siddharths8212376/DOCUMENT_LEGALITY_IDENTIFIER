L618688 +++$+++ u3316 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ GOOSE +++$+++ Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
L619425 +++$+++ u3317 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ HOLLYWOOD +++$+++ GOT 'EM.
L619424 +++$+++ u3326 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ WOLFMAN +++$+++ I'VE GOT TWO MORE BOGEYS COMING IN AT FOUR O'CLOCK HIGH.
L619146 +++$+++ u3317 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ HOLLYWOOD +++$+++ He won again.
L619145 +++$+++ u3326 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ WOLFMAN +++$+++ What now?
L619144 +++$+++ u3317 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ HOLLYWOOD +++$+++ Hear about Ice?
L619140 +++$+++ u3326 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ WOLFMAN +++$+++ I didn't ruin her.
L619139 +++$+++ u3317 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ HOLLYWOOD +++$+++ Coogan spent half the night looking for her. He said he was gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his sister.
L619135 +++$+++ u3326 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ WOLFMAN +++$+++ That's her--tall hungry woman with fire in her eyes. It was great.
L619134 +++$+++ u3317 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ HOLLYWOOD +++$+++ The girl with the purple fingernails?
L619133 +++$+++ u3326 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ WOLFMAN +++$+++ Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
L619132 +++$+++ u3317 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ HOLLYWOOD +++$+++ That's because you don't have any women.
L619131 +++$+++ u3326 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ WOLFMAN +++$+++ It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.
L618980 +++$+++ u3317 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ HOLLYWOOD +++$+++ Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky.
L618979 +++$+++ u3326 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ WOLFMAN +++$+++ No, we...got our butts kicked.
L618758 +++$+++ u3317 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ HOLLYWOOD +++$+++ It's not the plaque. The winner can get assigned here as instructor. He gets to fight every day.
L618757 +++$+++ u3326 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ WOLFMAN +++$+++ A plaque?
L619548 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ No. You can be mine!
L619547 +++$+++ u3318 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ ICE +++$+++ You're a hell of a flyer.  You can be my wingman any time.
L619546 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ We did it.
L619545 +++$+++ u3318 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ ICE +++$+++ You saved our lives. You did it!
L619544 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
L619543 +++$+++ u3318 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ ICE +++$+++ I guess I owe you one.
L619508 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ WHEN I SHOOT, YOU BREAK LEFT..3..2
L619507 +++$+++ u3318 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ ICE +++$+++ WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
L619506 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
L619505 +++$+++ u3318 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ ICE +++$+++ I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
L619504 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ I GOT A WINDER LEFT, BUT NO GOOD TONE ON IT.
L619464 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.
L619463 +++$+++ u3318 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ ICE +++$+++ ON THE NOSE?
L619455 +++$+++ u3318 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ ICE +++$+++ LOOK OUT!
L619454 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH.
L619232 +++$+++ u3318 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ ICE +++$+++ NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
L619231 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
L619230 +++$+++ u3318 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ ICE +++$+++ NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
L619229 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
L619228 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. I'M IN.
L619227 +++$+++ u3318 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ ICE +++$+++ STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
L619226 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ COME OFF--COME OFF RIGHT. I'M ON MY WAY IN. YOU GO FREE, I'M ENGAGING.
L619225 +++$+++ u3318 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ ICE +++$+++ IT'S MY SHOT.
L619224 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
L619223 +++$+++ u3318 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ ICE +++$+++ GET LOST!
L619222 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
L619221 +++$+++ u3318 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ ICE +++$+++ GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. GET OUT OF THERE.
L619220 +++$+++ u3318 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ ICE +++$+++ STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN.
L619219 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M IN--I'LL ENGAGE.
L619217 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ SHIT!!
L619216 +++$+++ u3318 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ ICE +++$+++ ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
L618816 +++$+++ u3319 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ ICEMAN +++$+++ And you were with Cougar. He was my roommate in flight school.
L618815 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
L618814 +++$+++ u3319 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ ICEMAN +++$+++ You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
L618813 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ I think I can work it out on my own.
L618812 +++$+++ u3319 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ ICEMAN +++$+++ Need a hint?
L618811 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ Nope.
L618810 +++$+++ u3319 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ ICEMAN +++$+++ Who is the best.
L618809 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ Figured out what?
L618808 +++$+++ u3319 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ ICEMAN +++$+++ Figured it out yet?
L619565 +++$+++ u3320 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ JESTER +++$+++ Well, he's in trouble and he didn't even get here yet.
L619564 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ Three guesses.
L619563 +++$+++ u3320 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ JESTER +++$+++ Who's the hell is that?
L619343 +++$+++ u3320 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ JESTER +++$+++ Some guys never get it back.
L619342 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ So have I.
L619341 +++$+++ u3320 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ JESTER +++$+++ I've seen this before.
L619340 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
L619339 +++$+++ u3320 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ JESTER +++$+++ He just won't engage. He can't do it, Skipper. He can't get back on the horse.
L619174 +++$+++ u3320 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ JESTER +++$+++ NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR WINGMAN. NICE GOING.
L619173 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.
L619006 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class.   "Maverick!"
L619005 +++$+++ u3320 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ JESTER +++$+++ He's seat of the pants... Completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book. All over the sky. But I don't know, Skip, he's really got something.
L619002 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ Tell me one thing.
L619001 +++$+++ u3320 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ JESTER +++$+++ I don't know what to tell you, Skip.
L618996 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ But you continued to fight.
L618995 +++$+++ u3320 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ JESTER +++$+++ Just below ten thousand.
L618994 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
L618640 +++$+++ u3325 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ What makes you think we can get back in?  We don't have the fuel for this. MAVERICK Just get me to him.
L618639 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ Helping him in.
L618638 +++$+++ u3325 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ What the hell you doing?
L618637 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ I...FORGOT SOMETHING.
L618614 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ COUGAR, THIS IS MAVERICK.  I'M GETTING HUNGRY, LET'S HEAD FOR THE BARN. ...COUGAR, WHERE ARE YOU?
L618613 +++$+++ u3325 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.
L618612 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
L619150 +++$+++ u3326 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ WOLFMAN +++$+++ How's it goin', Coog?
L619149 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ Morning, Coogan.
L619142 +++$+++ u3326 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ WOLFMAN +++$+++ No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
L619141 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ You didn't help.
L619138 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ The girl with the purple fingernails was Coogan's sister.
L619137 +++$+++ u3326 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ WOLFMAN +++$+++ Bad?
L619136 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ It was bad.
L618978 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ Didn't everybody?
L618977 +++$+++ u3326 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ WOLFMAN +++$+++ You won?!!!
L618711 +++$+++ u3323 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ STINGER +++$+++ The wings..
L618710 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ Yes sir..
L618708 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ Yes sir!
L618707 +++$+++ u3323 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ STINGER +++$+++ That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
L618706 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ Sir?
L618705 +++$+++ u3323 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ STINGER +++$+++ You just did an incredibly brave thing! What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. I should ream you out for it. But it just doesn't work with you. You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe ...too good. You never really stepped in it yet. So this is your chance. I'm gonna send you up against the best. They are better than you. Maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out of it.
L618696 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ Me?
L618695 +++$+++ u3323 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ STINGER +++$+++ Was going.  Now you are.
L618691 +++$+++ u3323 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ STINGER +++$+++ I talked a man back once. Three months later, we lost him. It's his decision. Only he knows.
L618690 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ He's a good pilot.
L619403 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men.
L619402 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ Would you take me back? Would they?
L619401 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.
L619400 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ You think I shouldn't fly.
L619399 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen.
L619398 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ How can I go on? I feel so... responsible.
L619395 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ It's not true.
L619394 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ Not something they tell dependents.
L619393 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ I never heard that.
L619392 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the ramp.
L619391 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ He was by the book, all the way.
L619390 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ You may not think so, but you are.
L619389 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ I'm nothing like him.
L619388 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.
L619387 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ I know.
L619386 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... I served with your old man.
L619383 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ I didn't say that. That's up to you. But I have responsibility for the other guys up there, not just you. They need to know you're all right...that they can depend on you.
L619382 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ You think I should quit?!
L619381 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ It's no disgrace, kid. That spin was hell. It would wreck anyone's confidence. You could be a good pilot again someday...
L619379 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ I didn't know either. That's why I told Jester to prepare your papers.
L619378 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ I don't know...
L619377 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ Or you can quit.
L619376 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ Or....
L619375 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.
L619374 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ She said you took your kid to the each. Every second Sunday. Zoo or beach or the ballgame. Y'have the option... What about me?
L619373 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ My wife's house.
L619372 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ I called your house.
L619371 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ No bother.
L619370 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ Skipper, sorry to bother you.
L619254 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it.
L619253 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ He was...my responsibility--my RIO.
L619251 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ I know. I was there.
L619250 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ Goose is dead.
L619249 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ All right.
L619248 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ How do you feel?
L619188 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ The flying. The fighting.  I'd go up there ten times a day to fight. I'd win at least nine of them. That's all I want to do. It's what I do best. I am real good.  Just give me the jet.
L619187 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ Oh, you mean the thrill!
L619186 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ For the same reason you are.
L619185 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ Then why are you here?
L619184 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
L619183 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
L619182 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ I can take care of myself.
L619181 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ Of course you did. I said a great flyer, not a smart one. You fly reckless. Great instincts. No discipline. That ambush today, you followed your emotions instead of your wingman. Of course you got killed...and well deserved to. It was a really stupid mistake. In battle, it gets people killed.
L619180 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ I lost.
L619179 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ Twenty years' experience, I couldn't shake you. You may be a great flyer. I mean that.
L619161 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
L619160 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
L619116 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
L619115 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
L618999 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ The rules of engagement are not flexible. They exist for your safety. You will obey them. Is that clear?
L618998 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
L618997 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ Why?
L618992 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ Is that how you remember it?
L618991 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ I had him in view. I was peeling over the egg, into a dive. He saw me when I moved in for the kill. There wasn't any danger...
L618946 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ A good man. Good flyer.
L618945 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ Yes sir.
L618944 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
L618943 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
L618942 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign?
L618754 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ I like that in a fighter pilot.  It's okay to be confident. You have to think you're King Kong to want to try to land on carriers. Just keep in mind the other component of success...teamwork.
L618753 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ Yes sir.
L618752 +++$+++ u3324 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ VIPER +++$+++ Considering the company you're in, that's a pretty arrogant attitude.
L620989 +++$+++ u3327 +++$+++ m221 +++$+++ BENNY +++$+++ Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!
L620988 +++$+++ u3341 +++$+++ m221 +++$+++ QUAID +++$+++ What happened to number five?
L620799 +++$+++ u3341 +++$+++ m221 +++$+++ QUAID +++$+++ Take me to the hotel.
L620798 +++$+++ u3327 +++$+++ m221 +++$+++ BENNY +++$+++ Lemme ask you a question.  Ever fuck a mutant?
L620730 +++$+++ u3341 +++$+++ m221 +++$+++ QUAID +++$+++ And you get a kickback.
L620729 +++$+++ u3327 +++$+++ m221 +++$+++ BENNY +++$+++ I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
L620728 +++$+++ u3341 +++$+++ m221 +++$+++ QUAID +++$+++ Why not?
L620727 +++$+++ u3327 +++$+++ m221 +++$+++ BENNY +++$+++ Well, there it is; the Last Resort.  Sure you wanna go in?
