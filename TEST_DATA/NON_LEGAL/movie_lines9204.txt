L336773 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
L336772 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'm not playing a game now.
L336771 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
L336770 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What?
L336766 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ And you?
L336765 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It was.
L336764 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ It must've been very hard on Erica?
L336763 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
L336762 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L336761 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ She died in a car accident.
L336760 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
L336759 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Alright.  What about me?
L336758 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ No.  You were talking about chess.
L336757 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Wasn't I just talking about me?
L336756 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
L336755 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.
L336754 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I'm sure you are.
L336753 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No.  But I'm open to distractions.
L336752 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
L336707 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Because I think he's wrong.
L336706 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Why?
L336705 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ No.
L336704 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Doesn't that scare you?
L336703 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
L336702 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I know you didn't
L336700 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ How could you?  Unless you were there.
L336699 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I know it was bad.
L336698 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
L336697 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Relax.
L336656 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ No -- I'm not involved.  And I plan on keeping it that way.
L336655 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You're not?
L336654 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ No.
L336652 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Because I work with them.
L336651 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Why?
L336650 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Of course.
L336649 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
L336648 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ You have to win every point, don't you?
L336647 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Very good.  Spoken like a true psychologist.  When confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations.  What is that Masters and Johnson?
L336646 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.
L336645 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there?
L336644 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ That's not fair!
L336643 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You mean like in the steam room?
L336642 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.
L336641 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'm just curious.
L336639 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Okay.  So, tell me about yourself.  Are you married?
L336638 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Let's change the subject.
L336637 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Do you?
L336636 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Of course.
L336635 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
L336634 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
L336633 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Take your average cop.  They deal with death everyday.  If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
L336632 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ How can you look at it so clinically?
L336631 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.
L336630 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ This isn't a game.
L336629 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ In a way.
L336628 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Another kind of game?
L336627 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I think it's interesting.
L336626 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Does what's going on bother you at all? Or are you just wearing your game face?
L336625 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It wasn't intentional.
L336624 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ You sound like my mother.
L336623 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It's going to be a long night.  It could take hours before we know something.  You should try to eat.
L336622 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I don't think I could.
L336621 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You sure you don't want to eat something?
L336590 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ What if she isn't?  Where are your priorities?  You have to think between someone's life and a chess game?  The girl he killed last night was only twenty one years old!  He dumped her body behind a warehouse like a sack of garbage!
L336589 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ She could be dead now.
L336588 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ She could be dead after the game.
L336587 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I can't right now.  I've got a game.
L336586 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
L336585 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
L336584 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ We need your help.
L336583 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
L336582 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ They couldn't break the riddle.
L336486 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No you didn't.
L336485 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
L336484 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What are you looking for?
L336483 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Getting too hot in here for you?
L336482 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Well, I think I've had enough.
L336481 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Well, I hope you remember that tomorrow when you play Krikorian.
L336480 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
L336479 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ You.
L336478 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Are we talking about me, or chess?
L336477 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Do you always open quickly?
L336476 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It is.
L336475 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
L336474 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
L336473 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
L336472 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
L336471 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ That's a very personal question.
L336470 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
L336469 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ --but you enjoy being the stronger one? You like the control.
L336468 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
L336467 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Sounds very violent.
L336466 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
L336465 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ It seems like such a complicated game.
L336464 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ When I was very young.
L336463 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
L336462 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yes.
L336461 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Are you one of the players?
L336460 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Uh huh.
L336459 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Are you with the tournament?
L336458 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No.  I don't.
L336457 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?
L336456 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ How come you don't stay with them?
L336455 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I love this hotel.  I stay here every time I visit my parents.
L336454 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yes.
L336453 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Is this your first time here?
L336452 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ It's alright.
L336451 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Sorry.  I thought it was empty.
L336402 +++$+++ u1711 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ YURILIVICH +++$+++ Well, then this time you'll have to stay for the whole match, won't you?
L336401 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
L336400 +++$+++ u1711 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ YURILIVICH +++$+++ I'm not nervous.
L336399 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
L336398 +++$+++ u1711 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ YURILIVICH +++$+++ No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
L336397 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'm sure you are.
L336396 +++$+++ u1711 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ YURILIVICH +++$+++ Hello, Peter.  You played an interesting game last night.  Even though sacrificing your Queen at b-5 is the game I played against Valsney in '82.  I'm glad it helped you.
L338835 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ Yes.
L338834 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ That's a better one.
L338820 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ That way. I can feel the cold.
L338819 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ In the Arctic ice.
L338791 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the eyes of the Beast.
L338790 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ Lyssa ...
L338787 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ I knew you would come.
L338786 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
L338785 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ Yes.
L338782 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ All directions are the same here.
L338781 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ Take the western passage.
L338778 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.
L338777 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ I don't know how.
L338776 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ Will your power outward.
L338772 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ All the passages are guarded.
L338771 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ You must move away from the Center.
L338770 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ Colwyn ...
L338385 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ Colwyn. Colwyn.  I love you, Colwyn.
L338384 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
L338383 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ I know it.
L338382 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ I will find you. I will be with you.
L338381 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
L338380 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ Where is the Fortress?
L338379 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ Colwyn ...
L338378 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ Lyssa ...
L338281 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
L338280 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
L338278 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
L338277 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ Have they harmed you?
L338276 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ Colwyn.
L338275 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
L338216 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ I can't wait either.
L338215 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ About what?
L338214 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ I lied.
L338213 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ I can't.
L338212 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ Thank you, but I can wait.
L338211 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
L338210 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
L338209 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
L338204 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ Never mind my ears! Go away!
L338203 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
L338188 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ Well, then you can go up to the parapet and I'll hand the buckets up to you.
L338187 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ We're not married <u>yet</u>.
L338186 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ We're almost married.
L338185 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ <u>What</u>?
L338184 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
L338183 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ I have no intention of getting used to it.
L338182 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
L338181 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
L338180 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ Well, you're beautiful.
L338179 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
L338178 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ That's worse.
L338177 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
L338176 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
L338175 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ Me too.
L338174 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.
L338173 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
L338172 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ I don't have to go through with it either.
L338171 +++$+++ u1715 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ LYSSA +++$+++ I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
L338236 +++$+++ u1721 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TUROLD +++$+++ You will not follow the Slayers, you will obey my command!  You have no chance alone, boy. You must try to break through to Ynyr. He has great knowledge. Only with his help can you save Lyssa.
L338235 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
L338234 +++$+++ u1721 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TUROLD +++$+++ You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
L338233 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ I won't leave you here.
L338232 +++$+++ u1721 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TUROLD +++$+++ You will go alone.
L338230 +++$+++ u1721 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TUROLD +++$+++ You can't reach her!  Through the door.  Quickly!
L338229 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ They have Lyssa!
L338219 +++$+++ u1721 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TUROLD +++$+++ Of course it was.
L338218 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ It was a platonic kiss, Father.
L338217 +++$+++ u1721 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ TUROLD +++$+++ You'll both wait. At least for five hours. The wedding is at three.
L338804 +++$+++ u1712 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ COLWYN +++$+++ I forbid you!
L338803 +++$+++ u1725 +++$+++ m113 +++$+++ YNYR +++$+++ I can. Because I choose it.
