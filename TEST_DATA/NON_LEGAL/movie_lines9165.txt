L304121 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ You can't take that... It's personal property...!
L304117 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
L304116 +++$+++ u1492 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ FBI AGENT #2 +++$+++ Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
L304115 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?
L304114 +++$+++ u1492 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ FBI AGENT #2 +++$+++ That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38?
L304111 +++$+++ u1492 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ FBI AGENT #2 +++$+++ If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
L304110 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
L304109 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ What does that have to do with the price of tea in China?
L304108 +++$+++ u1492 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ FBI AGENT #2 +++$+++ Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
L304107 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ What caliber is my gun?
L304106 +++$+++ u1492 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ FBI AGENT #2 +++$+++ What caliber is your gun?
L304105 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ A gun? Yes.
L304102 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Yes, I'm afraid I did.
L304101 +++$+++ u1492 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ FBI AGENT #2 +++$+++ Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?
L303841 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Catch ya' later.
L303840 +++$+++ u1493 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ FELLING +++$+++ Okay. 
L303839 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ I'm gonna do a follow-up.
L303838 +++$+++ u1493 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ FELLING +++$+++ What about you, you got a crew already?
L303837 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
L303836 +++$+++ u1493 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ FELLING +++$+++ Hey, Lowell.
L303835 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Debbie...
L304471 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ "Mike?"
L304470 +++$+++ u1494 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ HELEN CAPERELLI +++$+++ Mike... Mike... Mike...
L304290 +++$+++ u1494 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ HELEN CAPERELLI +++$+++ Well, at the end of the day... because of your segment... the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company... could own CBS.
L304289 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ How grave?
L304288 +++$+++ u1494 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ HELEN CAPERELLI +++$+++ If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk.
L304267 +++$+++ u1494 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ HELEN CAPERELLI +++$+++ Are you sure?
L304266 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ No, no, we're fine...
L304265 +++$+++ u1494 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ HELEN CAPERELLI +++$+++ Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
L304293 +++$+++ u1494 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ HELEN CAPERELLI +++$+++ You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
L304292 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
L304286 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Is this "Alice in Wonderland"?
L304285 +++$+++ u1494 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ HELEN CAPERELLI +++$+++ They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
L304284 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Come again?
L304283 +++$+++ u1494 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ HELEN CAPERELLI +++$+++ Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
L304282 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Well, as a "standard"... I'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth?"
L304281 +++$+++ u1494 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ HELEN CAPERELLI +++$+++ Our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are the standard... for everyone else...
L304280 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
L304279 +++$+++ u1494 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ HELEN CAPERELLI +++$+++ And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
L304278 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
L304277 +++$+++ u1494 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ HELEN CAPERELLI +++$+++ I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
L304276 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?"
L304586 +++$+++ u1495 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ JIM COOPER +++$+++ Call me back in ten.
L304585 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
L304584 +++$+++ u1495 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ JIM COOPER +++$+++ Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...
L304583 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ How prominent? What kind of placement?
L304434 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Catch you later.
L304433 +++$+++ u1495 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ JIM COOPER +++$+++ Hi, baby.
L304431 +++$+++ u1495 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ JIM COOPER +++$+++ Hey, listen, I hear you guys are sitting on something sensational over there.
L304430 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ How are you, Jim?
L304429 +++$+++ u1495 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ JIM COOPER +++$+++ Hey, Lowell.
L304606 +++$+++ u1496 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ JIM COOPER'S VOICE +++$+++ No.  I'm assuming the cave-in begins with the threat of litigation from Big Tobacco. Are we talking... are we talking Brown & Williamson, here?
L304605 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Did I tell you you were wrong?
L304604 +++$+++ u1496 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ JIM COOPER'S VOICE +++$+++ Lowell?
L304603 +++$+++ u1496 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ JIM COOPER'S VOICE +++$+++ Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
L304602 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ You ready...?
L304601 +++$+++ u1496 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ JIM COOPER'S VOICE +++$+++ Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
L304600 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Why?
L304599 +++$+++ u1496 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ JIM COOPER'S VOICE +++$+++ You're sure you want to do this?
L304598 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Yeah?
L304597 +++$+++ u1496 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ JIM COOPER'S VOICE +++$+++ Okay.  Lowell?
L304596 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
L304579 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Jim, it's Lowell.
L304578 +++$+++ u1496 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ JIM COOPER'S VOICE +++$+++ Hello?
L304201 +++$+++ u1497 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE +++$+++ Yes... Jeffrey.
L304200 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Can we talk about this when I get back?
L304199 +++$+++ u1497 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE +++$+++ I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
L304197 +++$+++ u1497 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE +++$+++ That's for food.
L304196 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ What's the difference...
L304195 +++$+++ u1497 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE +++$+++ Use the bathroom.
L304194 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Where should I wash them?
L304193 +++$+++ u1497 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE +++$+++ Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
L304142 +++$+++ u1497 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE +++$+++ An interview! Do you know what they will do to us...! I thought... Sorry.
L304141 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ I'm doing an interview.
L304140 +++$+++ u1497 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE +++$+++ ...taping?  What are you taping?
L304120 +++$+++ u1497 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE +++$+++ I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you...
L304119 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ What's going on?
L303732 +++$+++ u1497 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE +++$+++ No, thank you.
L303731 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?
L303730 +++$+++ u1497 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE +++$+++ What are we supposed to do...? What about our medical coverage; what about our health? What about our car payments? The payments on this house?
L303729 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Thomas Sandefur...
L303728 +++$+++ u1497 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE +++$+++ Why? Who said?
L303727 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
L303726 +++$+++ u1497 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE +++$+++ I don't understand.
L303725 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ I didn't want to leave it there...
L303724 +++$+++ u1497 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE +++$+++ Why did you take your stuff from the office?
L303723 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ That's my stuff from the office...
L303722 +++$+++ u1497 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE +++$+++ Right now?
L303721 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Soy sauce...
L303720 +++$+++ u1497 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE +++$+++ What do you need at the store?
L303719 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ I'm going to the store. You need anything?
L303718 +++$+++ u1497 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE +++$+++ Uh, what are those boxes?
L303717 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Try the car.
L303716 +++$+++ u1497 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE +++$+++ I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?
L303709 +++$+++ u1497 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE +++$+++ Yes, it's on the stove...
L303708 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Is there any more rice...?
L303707 +++$+++ u1497 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE +++$+++ Don't you have to be at the office?
L303706 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ I can take her.
L303793 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Yes.
L303792 +++$+++ u1498 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE'S VOICE +++$+++ "60 Minutes," the television show?
L303791 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Yeah.
L303790 +++$+++ u1498 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE'S VOICE +++$+++ "60 Minutes"?
L303789 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
L303788 +++$+++ u1498 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE'S VOICE +++$+++ Did you say Berman?
L303787 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
L303786 +++$+++ u1498 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE'S VOICE +++$+++ Who's calling?
L303785 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Thank you, Bob.
L304545 +++$+++ u1505 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ You're not listening.  Really know what you're going to do before you do it.
L304544 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
L304543 +++$+++ u1505 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ No, you do not.
L304542 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ I got perspective.
L304541 +++$+++ u1505 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Get some perspective, Lowell.
L304540 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
L304539 +++$+++ u1505 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
L304538 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ "I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'" You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? "60 Minutes"? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it.
L304342 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Jeffrey...
L304341 +++$+++ u1505 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Jeffrey Wigand...
L304340 +++$+++ u1505 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Oh, baby...
L304339 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ I'm alone on this...
L304338 +++$+++ u1505 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ What are you and Mike going to do?
L304337 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
L304336 +++$+++ u1505 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ What?!
L304335 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ They're killing the Wigand interview...
L304334 +++$+++ u1505 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ What's wrong?
L303778 +++$+++ u1505 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ I have to take a shower.
L303777 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ ...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
L303776 +++$+++ u1505 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ ...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
L303775 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ ..."ignition propensity?"  ...you understand any of this...?
L303774 +++$+++ u1505 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye. 
L303773 +++$+++ u1505 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ I can't... I've got to fly to Boston tomorrow.
L303772 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Let me see this... No, 'cause I gotta know where you're going at all times.
L303770 +++$+++ u1505 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Hello? Yeah...
L303769 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Will independent sources corroborate that?
L303765 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Will he go on-camera and talk about the Mexico City branch?
L303764 +++$+++ u1505 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ No classes this morning?
L303761 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Let me call you back...
L303760 +++$+++ u1505 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
L303759 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
L304389 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Jeff! Wake the fuck up! Everybody is on the line here. If they can catch you in a lie, they can paint everything with that brush. Do you understand? Everything you say!
L304388 +++$+++ u1511 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND'S VOICE +++$+++ You're not even on this anymore... What do you care?
L304387 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Oh, my God.
L303980 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ No. No, it's okay... How's -- how's the new place?
L303979 +++$+++ u1511 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND'S VOICE +++$+++ Is it too late?
L303874 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Who is this?
L303873 +++$+++ u1511 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND'S VOICE +++$+++ ...you fucked me!
L303872 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Yeah...
L304557 +++$+++ u1504 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ RICHARD SCRUGGS +++$+++ All right. See you...
L304556 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ ...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
L304555 +++$+++ u1504 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ RICHARD SCRUGGS +++$+++ ...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion...
L304553 +++$+++ u1504 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ RICHARD SCRUGGS +++$+++ What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
L304552 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Yeah, I'm here.
L304073 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Okay. Thank you.
L304072 +++$+++ u1504 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ RICHARD SCRUGGS +++$+++ Alright?
L304071 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Yeah.
L304070 +++$+++ u1504 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ RICHARD SCRUGGS +++$+++ It would be better if he called us.
L304069 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
L304068 +++$+++ u1504 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ RICHARD SCRUGGS +++$+++ Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do...
L304067 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.
L304066 +++$+++ u1504 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ RICHARD SCRUGGS +++$+++ Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?
L304062 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Well, he may tape an interview with us. And, we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first, it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection.
L304061 +++$+++ u1504 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ RICHARD SCRUGGS +++$+++ What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
L304060 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
L304059 +++$+++ u1504 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ RICHARD SCRUGGS +++$+++ That's right...
L304058 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ ...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?
L304054 +++$+++ u1504 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ RICHARD SCRUGGS +++$+++ I'll call you then.
L304053 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Area code 212-555-0199.
L304052 +++$+++ u1504 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ RICHARD SCRUGGS +++$+++ Alright.
L304051 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
L304659 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ I did? What do I tell a source on the next tough story? Hang in with us. You'll be fine... maybe?
L304658 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ C'mon, it all worked out. You came out okay in the end...
L304655 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Everything interests me.
L304654 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ That Canada story? Still interest you?
L304624 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ You and I have been doing this together for fourteen years.
L304623 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Mike... in my...
L304621 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ I'm not talking celebrity, vanity, CBS. I'm talking about when you're nearer the end of your life than the beginning. Now, what do you think you think about then? The future? "In the future I'm going to do this? Become that?"  What "future"? No. What you think is: how will I be regarded in the end? After I'm gone.
L304620 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
L304619 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
L304618 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
L304617 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ Give me a break!
L304616 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Oh, please, Mike...
L304615 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
L304614 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
L304613 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
L304612 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
L304611 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ Yeah, that's right.
L304610 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Oh, lots.
L304609 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
L304608 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
L304607 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ Did I get you up?
L304503 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ I think it was a disgrace.
L304502 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ Alright. What did you think?
L304501 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ I disappeared on you?
L304500 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
L304499 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Yeah.
L304464 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ Do me a favor, will you? Spare me, for God's sake. Get in the real world. What do you think? I'm going to resign in protest? To force it on the air? The answer is "no." I don't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of National Public Radio.  That decision I've already made.
L304463 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
L304462 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
L304461 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ I've been banished. In lieu of being fired.
L304333 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ I'm with Don on this.
L304332 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ What?
