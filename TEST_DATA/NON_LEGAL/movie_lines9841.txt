L226733 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ Wanna know how I did that?
L226731 +++$+++ u5431 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Have a good night.
L226730 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ Randy, c'mon!
L226729 +++$+++ u5431 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I have a job...
L226728 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ Randy, you dipshit!  Take these off!
L226719 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ Listen, since I got you on the phone -- ask the guys there if they wanna chip in for a hooker.  I'll send her right over.  Her name is Vicki.
L226718 +++$+++ u5431 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ I'm now begging you.
L226717 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
L226716 +++$+++ u5431 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Oh my God, Steven.
L226715 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
L226714 +++$+++ u5431 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
L226713 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ ...and it's now ringing...ringing... and -- Hello? Anthony's Pizzeria? Yeah, this is officer Randy Parker over at the station.
L226711 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ Next, you dial a number.
L226710 +++$+++ u5431 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...
L226709 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  This one, for instance.
L226708 +++$+++ u5431 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ What are you doing?
L226702 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ Absolutely.  The church even sent me an autographed picture of God.  Ward!
L226701 +++$+++ u5431 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ It was a community service.
L226698 +++$+++ u5431 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Hell, when Steven was a kid, he was like, having strippers delivered to church Bingos and shit.
L226697 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ I mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?
L226696 +++$+++ u5431 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Jesus, Steven, that's...that's really lovely.
L226780 +++$+++ u5432 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Oh, you stupid, sorry son-of-a- bitch...
L226779 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
L226778 +++$+++ u5432 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
L226777 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ She did!
L226776 +++$+++ u5432 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ -- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
L226775 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --
L226774 +++$+++ u5432 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ You call what you did bad?!  You knocked her up and then left her!
L226773 +++$+++ u5432 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ -- Bad?!
L226772 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ Look, I know I treated her bad --
L226771 +++$+++ u5432 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ That's a lie.  Diana would never talk to you about Jessica.  Not after what you did to her.
L226770 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ About Jessica.
L226769 +++$+++ u5432 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ About what?
L226768 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
L226767 +++$+++ u5432 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Then why were you at her house?!  She didn't want anything to do with you.
L226766 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ I didn't kill her!
L226765 +++$+++ u5432 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ You don't know shit!
L226764 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ I know what it sounds like.
L226763 +++$+++ u5432 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
L226762 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ I've told you the truth.
L226761 +++$+++ u5432 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Until I hear the truth.
L226760 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ How many times do you want to hear this?
L226757 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ He was dead.  He had to be dead...
L226756 +++$+++ u5432 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Oh, my dear God...
L226724 +++$+++ u5434 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ A pizza?!
L226723 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
L226722 +++$+++ u5434 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ I'm literally going to kill you!
L226721 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
L226720 +++$+++ u5434 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ Steven!
L226700 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ Disgusting?  Bingo night was sold out for six months after that!  They raised enough money to build a day care center.
L226699 +++$+++ u5434 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ That's disgusting.
L226695 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ I'm sorry to hear that.  A famous man once said -- there is no worse regret then a temptation resisted.
L226694 +++$+++ u5434 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ I mean really never.
L226693 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
L226692 +++$+++ u5434 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ Never.
L226691 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ What do you mean you've never made a prank call?
L227205 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ I don't care about being hip anymore.
L227204 +++$+++ u5444 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ So what else is new?  Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
L227203 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ But she might be in trouble...
L227202 +++$+++ u5444 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
L227201 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ Have you seen Tamara?
L227200 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ Jason...Voorhees?
L227199 +++$+++ u5444 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
L227198 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...
L227073 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ But...wait a minute!
L227072 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
L227071 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ Time to check out the waiters.
L227070 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ Yeah.
L227069 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ That was truly excellent.
L227055 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter.  Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water...
L227054 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L227044 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ Nobody related to McCulloch can be nice.
L227043 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
L227042 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us...
L227036 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ Do you realize how many people would kill to be sitting here right now? Come on, it's grad night. You've got your whole life to be uptight.
L227035 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ I guess not.
L227034 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
L227033 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
L227032 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
L227031 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ No thanks.
L227024 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ You're joking, right?
L227023 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
L227022 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.
L227020 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ My stepmom couldn't care less, but Daddy would have a shit fit.  He might even pay some attention to me.
L227019 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
L227018 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ He's undefeated, you know that?  Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is.
L226947 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ Improvise, of course.
L226946 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L226945 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ A major prick.
L226934 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ More or less. It's part of my college fund.
L226933 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ He bought you that?
L226932 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
L226931 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us...especially with this.
L226930 +++$+++ u5435 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ EVA +++$+++ Really?
L226929 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
L226891 +++$+++ u5442 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ No.
L226890 +++$+++ u5436 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
L226889 +++$+++ u5442 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ And you'll never do it again.
L226888 +++$+++ u5436 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.
L226881 +++$+++ u5436 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Hear what?
L226880 +++$+++ u5442 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ Did you hear that?
L226878 +++$+++ u5442 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ So there's no reason for him to come back because there won't be any of us around...right?
L226877 +++$+++ u5436 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Right.
L226876 +++$+++ u5442 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
L226875 +++$+++ u5436 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Right.
L226860 +++$+++ u5436 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories.  Let's drop it, okay?
L226859 +++$+++ u5442 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ Tell me.
L226858 +++$+++ u5436 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
L226857 +++$+++ u5442 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ What murders?
L226854 +++$+++ u5436 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Nothing.
L226853 +++$+++ u5442 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ What's wrong?
L226849 +++$+++ u5442 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ Ask me in about five minutes.
L226848 +++$+++ u5436 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well...how do you feel?
L227357 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Don't be ridiculous!
L227356 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Jason's here in New York.
L227292 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ We have to get off this ship!!
L227291 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Dear Christ...
L227286 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Not another word, do you hear me??
L227285 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ This is Jason's fault!
L227284 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ She never should've set foot on this ship. This is your fault!
L227246 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ The fire alarm...
L227245 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ What's that?
L227196 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ What?? You sent her out there with a murderer running around loose??
L227195 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
L227194 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Christ...where's Rennie??
L227177 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ It's...dead.
L227176 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Where's the radio?
L226905 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ She changed her mind.  Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five.
L226904 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ But I thought...
L226903 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Rennie's not coming.
L226902 +++$+++ u5441 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
L227103 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ But I haven't even shown you my biology project...
L227102 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.
L227101 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ I packed it. Just for us.
L227100 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Where did you get that alcohol?
L227053 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Then I'll make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights.
L227052 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ They're out of town.
L227051 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your parents.
L227048 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ Nothing.
L227047 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ What are you doing in here?
L226944 +++$+++ u5443 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ TAMARA +++$+++ Perfectly.
L226943 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ All right. But if it mysteriously disappears en route, I'll have you sent back home the minute we dock. Understood?
L227334 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ My niece's life hangs in the balance right now!! Every second counts.
L227333 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ I don't think that's such a safe idea
L227332 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Everyone split up -- we'll cover more ground that way.
L227317 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ A wonderful choice of places to dock a boat, Mr. Robertson.
L227316 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ There must be a phone around here somewhere.
L227282 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
L227281 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ What did you do with Rennie??
L227253 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Use some common sense! Setting off a fire alarm causes panic...the same kind of panic caused by suggesting Jason Voorhees is on board.  Enough is enough.
L227252 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L227251 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ I doubt very much that one even exists.
L227242 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!
L227241 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ He's doing the best he can, Charles.
L227240 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you.  Has he brought it back on course yet?
L227239 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ Did you find Rennie?
L227189 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Walking corpses are not real!
L227188 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
L227187 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.
L227186 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ What are you doing??
L227175 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ Oh dear God...
L227174 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ I demand to know what is going on...
L227136 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ Where is she?
L227135 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ I thought I told you to stay away from her.
L227092 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen.
L227091 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...
L226958 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ No, I think it's just the beginning.
L226957 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
L226956 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
L226955 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
L226954 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
L226953 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ You have no right...
L226952 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
L226951 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
L226950 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ Don't be. They probably decided to explore each other rather than New York.
L226949 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
L226948 +++$+++ u5438 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MISS VAN DEUSEN +++$+++ Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?
L227385 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
L227384 +++$+++ u5445 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ YOUNG RENNIE +++$+++ I...I can't...
L227382 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Am I? Let's find out.
L227381 +++$+++ u5445 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ YOUNG RENNIE +++$+++ You're telling a lie.
L227380 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim.
L227379 +++$+++ u5445 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ YOUNG RENNIE +++$+++ He is not.
L227378 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake.
L227375 +++$+++ u5445 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ YOUNG RENNIE +++$+++ I'll take some lessons this time. I promise.
L227374 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.
L227373 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
L227372 +++$+++ u5445 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ YOUNG RENNIE +++$+++ What a beautiful day.
L227388 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ I was only trying to teach you. But I pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your life.
L227387 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ You pushed me...
L227297 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ You can and you will!!
L227296 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ I...I can't...
L227295 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Get in the boat, Rennie!
L227228 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ This isn't a request.
L227227 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
L227226 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.
L227225 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ But what about the drowning boy I've been seeing?
L227224 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
L227223 +++$+++ u5440 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ RENNIE +++$+++ Can't we at least talk about it?
L227217 +++$+++ u5437 +++$+++ m362 +++$+++ MCCULLOCH +++$+++ I'm the one you should be listening to! Do you think dropping an anchor in the middle of a storm makes any sense whatsoever?
