L246084 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?
L246081 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Nice.  And your lighting and camera angles.  You're got to go back to German silent movies to find anything like it.
L246080 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ This is the studio where I paint.
L246078 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ After you then.

L246075 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
L246074 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  "Bride of Frankenstein."
L246072 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I know.  People's movies aren't their lives.
L246071 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ One likes to live simply.
L246070 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein.  I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
L246069 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ No.  I expect you can't.
L246068 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Mr. Whale, this is such an honor. You're one of my favorite all-time directors.  I can't believe I'm meeting you.
L246719 +++$+++ u5571 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ PRINCESS MARGARET +++$+++ I am such a goose.  I mistook you for Cecil Beaton.  It's the hat. You're wearing one of Cecil's hats, you know.

L246717 +++$+++ u5571 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ PRINCESS MARGARET +++$+++ Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?
L246716 +++$+++ u5571 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ PRINCESS MARGARET +++$+++ I've changed my hair, you see. Since our last session.  Those old snaps look rather dowdy now.

L248043 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
L248042 +++$+++ u5573 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ ATLEY JACKSON +++$+++ I do ...  Christ, what happened to us ?
L248041 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
L248040 +++$+++ u5573 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ ATLEY JACKSON +++$+++ I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...
L248039 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
L248038 +++$+++ u5573 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ ATLEY JACKSON +++$+++ And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.

L247818 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ Who was the job for?
L247817 +++$+++ u5573 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ ATLEY JACKSON +++$+++ The point is: Kip's been living the life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy. Makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. But he fungold this one so bad, folks around L.B. are already speakin' about him in the past tense.
L247816 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...
L247815 +++$+++ u5573 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ ATLEY JACKSON +++$+++ Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -

L247812 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?
L247811 +++$+++ u5573 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ ATLEY JACKSON +++$+++ A boost. A big boost ...

L247807 +++$+++ u5573 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ ATLEY JACKSON +++$+++ Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...

L248681 +++$+++ u5574 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ CALITRI +++$+++ Fifty cars. Fifty cars by 8 AM Friday. Or Kip goes in that box. That was the deal ... Goddamn, it ... That was the deal ...
L248680 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ You got no choice. It's over.
L248679 +++$+++ u5574 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ CALITRI +++$+++ Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...
L248678 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ What do you mean -- ?
L248677 +++$+++ u5574 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ CALITRI +++$+++ Well, that certainly won't do.
L248675 +++$+++ u5574 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ CALITRI +++$+++ I don't know about that, Randall. He did such a good job on this paper. And another one just came in ...

L247919 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
L247918 +++$+++ u5574 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ CALITRI +++$+++ Grow up. You don't kill people like me. People like me die in their sleep at 87 ... Do you know why? Because if you did kill me, and everyone knew it was you - for the next ten years they'd be finding pieces of those you love scattered all over California ...
L247917 +++$+++ u5582 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ MEMPHIS +++$+++ I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ...
L247916 +++$+++ u5574 +++$+++ m371 +++$+++ CALITRI +++$+++ My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best.  Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother. You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in turn, is very bad for them...
