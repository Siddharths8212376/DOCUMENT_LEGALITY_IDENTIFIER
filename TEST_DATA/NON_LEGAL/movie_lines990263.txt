L484398 +++$+++ u7448 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ U.S. ATTORNEY +++$+++ One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
L484397 +++$+++ u7435 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COURT'S ATTORNEY +++$+++ One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
L484396 +++$+++ u7448 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ U.S. ATTORNEY +++$+++ I can't give you that.  This guy's been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years.  He's been getting it from every end.  I'd love to hear his story.
L484305 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ 'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
L484304 +++$+++ u7436 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DC +++$+++ Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
L484303 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
L484302 +++$+++ u7436 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DC +++$+++ Visit her at the home.
L484299 +++$+++ u7436 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DC +++$+++ Look, why don't you just call Diane again?
L484298 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ That was a mistake.  The rain on my car is a baptism.  The new me.  Iceman, power Lloyd.  My assault on the world begins now. Believe in myself, answer to no one... You probably got it all figured out, Corey.  If you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise.
L483610 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
L483609 +++$+++ u7436 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DC +++$+++ Lloyd, she's being difficult.
L484429 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I don't know what to say to you, except goodbye.
L484428 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Hi.
L484427 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Hello.
L484377 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ You're right.
L484376 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Don't say that, it's not good for you.  You're...
L484375 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I'm so ashamed dad.
L484374 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
L484373 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
L484372 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ That's right, work it out.
L484371 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ No.  I told you everything, you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.
L484370 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?
L484369 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
L484368 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
L484367 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...
L484366 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I made their lives better.
L484365 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ No, but you stole from them.
L484364 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No, you don't know what it is.  It's not for me.  This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors to set you up, so you don't have to depend on anybody again.  Diane, I take better care of these people than their families do.  I care for them, I give them flowers, I feed them, I wipe their mouths...
L484363 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Yes, I...
L484362 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You think you know what this money is?
L484361 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ You stole from them, you lied to me.  How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
L484360 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Honey, about what?
L484359 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ What am I supposed to think?
L484358 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Honey, it's not what you think.
L484357 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ But I found the money.
L484356 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I swear to god.
L484355 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Swear to god.
L484354 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Honey!
L484353 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
L484352 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Sweetheart, no.  Don't be ridiculous.
L484351 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?
L484350 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What happened to you?
L484335 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Just finishing up in here.
L484334 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Dad, are you okay in there?
L484314 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.
L484313 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.
L484203 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Dad, I love him.
L484202 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ 'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
L484201 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen.  What's wrong with having some fun?  I like him.
L484200 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Diane, I'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy. Give him a present, here, let him know you still care.  Give him this pen.
L484199 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
L484198 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.
L484197 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Unbelievable.  This is a nightmare.
L484196 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well listen to me.  Now, I know you like him, I know he's nothing like those frat kids you can't stand, but honey, after the excitement wears off, then what, huh?  What are you going to talk about?  What do you have in common?  You're going to be part of an international think-tank, and he's going to be kicking punching bags.
L484195 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I like him a lot.
L484194 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Do you love him?
L484193 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Dad, why are you acting this way?  Is this because of the other morning?
L484192 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Diane!  Alright, let's stop this right now.  Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous.  This isn't even smart thinking.
L484191 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ You're not listening to me.
L484190 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Bon voyage.
L484189 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
L484188 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You're going.
L484187 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
L484186 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You're going.
L484185 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.
L484152 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Dad, no.  But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him.
L484151 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Did he ever get rough with you?
L484149 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Sit down.
L484148 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
L484147 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Lloyd?
L484146 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I know that.
L484145 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
L484144 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I'm fine.
L484143 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
L484142 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.
L484141 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
L484140 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I was irresponsible, I should have called.
L484139 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You should be.
L484138 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Dad, I'm sorry.
L484137 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Morning.
L484030 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Which they did, and every once in a while on a commercial, you can hear me scream.
L484029 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh yeah.  There was, uh, somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio, and, uh, we got this telephone call, this guy is making a sound effects record, and he'd gotten our address and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream.
L484026 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ So anyway, these two federal marshals meet the plane, and they take our address, and they ask us never to fly with 'Friendly Skies' again.
L484025 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Okay, I give up.
L484024 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Which they did.  Let me finish.
L484023 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.
L484022 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ So anyway, they closed the doors, and she starts to scream.  I've never in my life heard anyone scream quite like that.
L484019 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Crash paranoia.
L484018 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
L484017 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well, let me start it.  I'm flying down to Los Angeles on business, and I decide to take her on her first aeroplane.
L484014 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Now why can't I tell the story?
L484013 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Dad.
L484012 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ She's not the world's greatest flyer, let me tell you.  When she was eight years old, she...
L483981 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Goodnight.
L483980 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Goodnight.
L483979 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well, I don't think he's really been embarrassed by it.
L483978 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
L483977 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
L483976 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
L483975 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Morning honey.
L483745 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No, listen to me.  You're the best in the country, don't you understand?  It's like a pyramid.  It starts out with everybody, and it narrows through your life and through everything, and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents.  And it's you.  So tell me something, where's the flaw in that?  There is no flaw.
L483744 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous.
L483743 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.
L483742 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ God, I'll have to go on a plane.
L483741 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.
L483740 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I won?
L483739 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You won it.  You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.
L483738 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!
L483737 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.
L483736 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Tell me, is it bad news?
L483735 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I just had a phone call.
L483734 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ What?
L483704 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I love you too honey.
L483703 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I love you dad.
L483702 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L483701 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Stop it, stop it, stop it.
L483700 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss.  It's all working out for you honey, don't you see?  It's all working out, just like we planned.  All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
L483699 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
L483698 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
L483697 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me.  I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
L483696 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ They really applauded you today honey.
L483695 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Oh god, I don't need all these presents.  I don't know any kid who got a car, I mean...
L483694 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours.  Go ahead, open it.
L483693 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ God, that's... this is ridiculous.
L483692 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.
L483691 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ What are you doing?
L483690 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Okay, I promise I will.  Just come here a minute, I want to show you something.
L483689 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend.
L483647 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot.  But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us?  We all know what the answers are.  We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family.  But what if that doesn't happen?  I have, I have to be honest though, I have all the hope and ambition in the world.  But when I think about the future, the truth is, I am really...scared.
L483646 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Ha!
L483640 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Okay.
L483639 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
L483638 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful.   It's... no, don't worry about it.  You're very funny.  Go back, that's great!
L483637 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I didn't think anyone would get it.
L483636 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh yeah!
L483635 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ You like it?
L483634 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!
L483633 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back.
L483632 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Why?  It's fine.  It's nice.
L483631 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years... I might cut that part out.
L484064 +++$+++ u7446 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MRS COURT +++$+++ Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
L484063 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ You will?
L484062 +++$+++ u7446 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MRS COURT +++$+++ Alright.
L484061 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
L484060 +++$+++ u7446 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MRS COURT +++$+++ If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
L484059 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
L484058 +++$+++ u7446 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MRS COURT +++$+++ You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
L484057 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ This is me telling you about me.
L484056 +++$+++ u7446 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MRS COURT +++$+++ Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.
L484055 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Mom, please?
L484447 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I know.
L484446 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ No.  You just described every great success story.  Alright, it's alright.
L484445 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
L484444 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ How's it going?
L484443 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Not right now, thanks.
L484442 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
L484441 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Okay.
L484440 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
L484439 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Good to know.
L484438 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
L484437 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Okay.
L484436 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Alright, high level air safety tips.  If anything happens, it'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight, right?
L484435 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Okay.
L484434 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Okay, good, this is all very noble.
