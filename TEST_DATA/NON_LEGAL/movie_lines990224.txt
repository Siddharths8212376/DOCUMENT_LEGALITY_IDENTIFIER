L457624 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Meaning what?
L457623 +++$+++ u7204 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ EDITOR +++$+++ Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
L457622 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Charming. More delightful people crippled.
L457621 +++$+++ u7204 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ EDITOR +++$+++ Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
L457620 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
L457619 +++$+++ u7204 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ EDITOR +++$+++ Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
L457618 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ As I live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince.
L458231 +++$+++ u7212 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ SPARROW +++$+++ Well, maybe it was. I don't remember.  You got to do something for me, I can't stand it any longer -- I can't!
L458230 +++$+++ u7205 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FIRST DETECTIVE +++$+++ You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
L458229 +++$+++ u7212 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ SPARROW +++$+++ No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
L458228 +++$+++ u7205 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FIRST DETECTIVE +++$+++ You didn't happen to be going to Worth's place, did you?
L458225 +++$+++ u7212 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ SPARROW +++$+++ No, sir. About three months ago.
L458224 +++$+++ u7205 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FIRST DETECTIVE +++$+++ Don't remember what day that was, do you?
L458223 +++$+++ u7212 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ SPARROW +++$+++ I don't remember. Not so very far--
L458222 +++$+++ u7205 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FIRST DETECTIVE +++$+++ Where were you going when you got in that cab?
L458221 +++$+++ u7212 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ SPARROW +++$+++ Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.
L457676 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Thanks.
L457675 +++$+++ u7211 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ It's all yours.
L457674 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
L457673 +++$+++ u7211 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
L457672 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Make it snappy, Colonel.
L457668 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Hotcha! Saved, one job!
L457667 +++$+++ u7211 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.
L457666 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ What does that prove?
L457665 +++$+++ u7211 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.
L457664 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
L457663 +++$+++ u7211 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
L457662 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
L457661 +++$+++ u7211 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ That's the one.
L457660 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Old Howard Winton's cub?
L457659 +++$+++ u7211 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ Do you know George Winton?
L457658 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ No foolin' -- any suspect?
L457657 +++$+++ u7211 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
L457656 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
L457655 +++$+++ u7211 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
L457654 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
L457653 +++$+++ u7211 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ No kiddin'.
L457652 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
L457651 +++$+++ u7211 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?
L457650 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ How's every little thing?
L457649 +++$+++ u7211 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ Call the Homicide Squad!
L457640 +++$+++ u7209 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Here's a wow.
L457639 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
L457638 +++$+++ u7209 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ I told you he was a sore.
L457616 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Ain't that something. The mad monk of Manhattan. Here goes nothing.  Listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion.
L457615 +++$+++ u7209 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.
L457614 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
L457613 +++$+++ u7209 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ What do you mean police dog?
L457612 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
L457611 +++$+++ u7209 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Where'd you get the stag hound?
L458278 +++$+++ u7210 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ Better cut that out.  That's what happens to girls who bite their nails.  What's wrong?
L458277 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Ralph, come here a minute, will you?
L458268 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ No. I wanted to do it without saying anything. I think he's worth it.
L458267 +++$+++ u7210 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
L458266 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Well, I'll tell you a secret. I kinda like the old gent and I'm trying to build a special Sunday Magazine story out of him. It might help him a whole lot. But that's a side issue -- something I do on my own time.
L458265 +++$+++ u7210 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ I guess so. But wouldn't it be better for you to wait until the old man's here?
L458264 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
L458263 +++$+++ u7210 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ What are you people doing out in the middle of the night?
L457901 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Horsefeathers!
L457900 +++$+++ u7210 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ Nix, Flo -- he won't let you in and you'll only get me in Dutch.
L457899 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Who? Old Santa Claus there? That's easy for anyone with my sex appeal. He's a pushover. Watch me stand that old dodo on his ear.
L457898 +++$+++ u7210 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
L457897 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ He might get some publicity out of it.
L457890 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Don't worry -- she'll get used to it.
L457889 +++$+++ u7210 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.
L457888 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Fine, thanks.
L458309 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Don't ask any questions. Come on!
L458308 +++$+++ u7213 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WINTON +++$+++ What is it? What happened?
L458206 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Well, that being the case, I'll take it up with the board of directors. Hey, listen, aviator, here we are!
L458205 +++$+++ u7213 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WINTON +++$+++ Heaven knows. A lot.
L458204 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ How much money have you got?
L458203 +++$+++ u7213 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WINTON +++$+++ You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
L458202 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Oh, is that what caused it?
L458201 +++$+++ u7213 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WINTON +++$+++ No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
L458200 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
L458199 +++$+++ u7213 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WINTON +++$+++ I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
L458198 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ --and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.
L458194 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Darned if I don't! 
L458193 +++$+++ u7213 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WINTON +++$+++ You go in for dangerous things.
L458192 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Why?
L458144 +++$+++ u7213 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WINTON +++$+++ No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it. 
L458143 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box.
L458082 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.
L458081 +++$+++ u7213 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WINTON +++$+++ Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do?
L458080 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ All right, brother. Then you can go to some nice warm place, and I don't mean California.
L458079 +++$+++ u7213 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WINTON +++$+++ I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
L458078 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
L458077 +++$+++ u7213 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WINTON +++$+++ Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
L458076 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
L458075 +++$+++ u7213 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WINTON +++$+++ Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.
L457755 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ That's what they're going to ask you.
L457754 +++$+++ u7213 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WINTON +++$+++ Who'd steal her body?
L457753 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ That happens to be the truth.
L457752 +++$+++ u7213 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WINTON +++$+++ Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
L457751 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are.
L457750 +++$+++ u7213 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WINTON +++$+++ Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...
L457749 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
L457748 +++$+++ u7213 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WINTON +++$+++ No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
L457747 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ You weren't going with her?
L457746 +++$+++ u7213 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WINTON +++$+++ We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.
L457745 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ I see. Was that all she said?
L457744 +++$+++ u7213 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WINTON +++$+++ She laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... She said she wanted to be friends.
L457743 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?
L457742 +++$+++ u7213 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WINTON +++$+++ They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
L457741 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
L457740 +++$+++ u7213 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WINTON +++$+++ For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
L457739 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?
L457738 +++$+++ u7213 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WINTON +++$+++ My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
L457737 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ That's what I said.
L457736 +++$+++ u7213 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WINTON +++$+++ Cry-baby?
L457735 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
L457734 +++$+++ u7213 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WINTON +++$+++ Yes, sure, that's fine. While I'm proving my innocence, you people are going to uncover every petty kid trick I ever did ... you're going to write editorials about every cocktail I ever drank. Anything that any sane, normal person might have done will have a sinister meaning, if I did it.  Go on! Get out! I don't want to talk to you! 
L457733 +++$+++ u7206 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ FLORENCE +++$+++ Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
L457732 +++$+++ u7213 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WINTON +++$+++ Yeah. I suppose you people will crucify me for something I didn't do.  I didn't! You understand that! ... I didn't do it! She -- tried before -- 
L457545 +++$+++ u7208 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Good night.  And I am very grateful to you.
L457544 +++$+++ u7207 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ GOLATILY +++$+++ Good night, sir.
L457543 +++$+++ u7208 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ It will always afford me great pleasure to see you. 
L457542 +++$+++ u7207 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ GOLATILY +++$+++ I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
L457541 +++$+++ u7208 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
L457540 +++$+++ u7207 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ GOLATILY +++$+++ She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
L457539 +++$+++ u7208 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
L457538 +++$+++ u7207 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ GOLATILY +++$+++ Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.
L457537 +++$+++ u7208 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ You are too gracious. These things have some merit, I suspect ... but this--  ... I am convinced, is fine. 
L457574 +++$+++ u7214 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WORTH +++$+++ Not at all -- let me show you how easily it can be done. 
L457573 +++$+++ u7208 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ You're insane.
L457572 +++$+++ u7214 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WORTH +++$+++ Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
L457571 +++$+++ u7208 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.
L457570 +++$+++ u7214 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WORTH +++$+++ You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
L457569 +++$+++ u7208 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ And you think I will permit this, my friend?
L457568 +++$+++ u7214 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WORTH +++$+++ I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!
L457565 +++$+++ u7208 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ You are asking to burn these people ... you are asking? ... 
L457564 +++$+++ u7214 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WORTH +++$+++ I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
L457563 +++$+++ u7208 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ A fire! Is this your idea of humor, my friend?
L457562 +++$+++ u7214 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WORTH +++$+++ Yes, there's our way out. A fire in this place would give us ten thousand pounds.
L457561 +++$+++ u7208 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Fire insurance!
L457560 +++$+++ u7214 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WORTH +++$+++ No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these. 
L457559 +++$+++ u7208 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Is that a fact?
L457558 +++$+++ u7214 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WORTH +++$+++ Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
L457557 +++$+++ u7208 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.
L457554 +++$+++ u7208 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ That is unfortunate.
L457553 +++$+++ u7214 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WORTH +++$+++ I came back for some of the books. I am trying to straighten out the accounts. I don't hope to impress you, but I may as well tell you: We haven't a farthing!
L458020 +++$+++ u7208 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
L458019 +++$+++ u7210 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.
L457885 +++$+++ u7210 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ All right, I'll tell them. They're right here in front.
L457884 +++$+++ u7208 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ If you leave before the work is done, you will be gone for a much longer period ... you will be gone for good.
L457883 +++$+++ u7210 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ I will only be gone about half an hour.
L457882 +++$+++ u7208 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
L457881 +++$+++ u7210 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ But I have some friends waiting.
L457880 +++$+++ u7208 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
L457879 +++$+++ u7210 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ To lunch.
L457808 +++$+++ u7208 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ If it is freedom to represent people with limbs that don't match -- cripples -- you have achieved your purpose. Anatomy! Heaven forgive you. You must have studied with a sideshow of freaks!
L457807 +++$+++ u7210 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ But the composition as a whole -- I've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.
L457806 +++$+++ u7208 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor --  A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.
L457805 +++$+++ u7210 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
L457804 +++$+++ u7208 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
L457803 +++$+++ u7210 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
L457802 +++$+++ u7208 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ If my curiosity is not too great, would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing?
L458018 +++$+++ u7208 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.
L458017 +++$+++ u7212 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ SPARROW +++$+++ I'd know him anywhere.
L457933 +++$+++ u7208 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ He can't hear you.
L457932 +++$+++ u7212 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ SPARROW +++$+++ What are you laughing at?
L457931 +++$+++ u7212 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ SPARROW +++$+++ I wonder if I could have her pose for me.
L457930 +++$+++ u7208 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ She is the soul of that statue.
L457828 +++$+++ u7208 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ You have done well, and now I, too, have something for you. Come.
L457827 +++$+++ u7212 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ SPARROW +++$+++ I'd be glad to, Mr. Igor.  I think I'll have somethin' to tell you soon.
L457822 +++$+++ u7208 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Yes.
L457821 +++$+++ u7212 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ SPARROW +++$+++ Shall we unpack it?
L457817 +++$+++ u7208 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Otto! You and one of those other fellows! Come help Professor Darcey.
L457816 +++$+++ u7212 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ SPARROW +++$+++ Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
L457815 +++$+++ u7208 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Have you got it? Is it completed?
L457980 +++$+++ u7213 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WINTON +++$+++ Thanks.
L457979 +++$+++ u7214 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WORTH +++$+++ Well, any time I can do anything for you --
L457978 +++$+++ u7213 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WINTON +++$+++ They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
L457977 +++$+++ u7214 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WORTH +++$+++ I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
L457976 +++$+++ u7213 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WINTON +++$+++ Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
L457975 +++$+++ u7214 +++$+++ m485 +++$+++ WORTH +++$+++ Yep. Everything settled.
L456403 +++$+++ u7215 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Yes....
L456402 +++$+++ u7217 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ PENTCHO +++$+++ Mia...?
L456401 +++$+++ u7215 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ What was her name?  The one I met.
L456400 +++$+++ u7217 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ PENTCHO +++$+++ Excuse me???
L456399 +++$+++ u7215 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ What was her name?
L456398 +++$+++ u7215 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ -- What if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor?  What then?   What did your life mean?  Who did you nurture, Pauly?  Who did you love?
L456397 +++$+++ u7217 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ PENTCHO +++$+++ You did miss --
L456396 +++$+++ u7215 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
L456395 +++$+++ u7217 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ PENTCHO +++$+++ You did.
L456394 +++$+++ u7215 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Two: what if I didn't miss?
L456393 +++$+++ u7217 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ PENTCHO +++$+++ Dad...
L456392 +++$+++ u7215 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?
L456391 +++$+++ u7217 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ PENTCHO +++$+++ You taking any medication?
L456390 +++$+++ u7215 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ To isolation.  To an armed camp.  To a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son.
L456426 +++$+++ u7216 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ MIA +++$+++ So I can move on.  You too.
L456425 +++$+++ u7217 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ PENTCHO +++$+++ Why?
L456421 +++$+++ u7216 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ MIA +++$+++ What?
L456420 +++$+++ u7217 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ PENTCHO +++$+++ Then you get it.  You'll understand.
L456419 +++$+++ u7216 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ MIA +++$+++ I've been dreaming about this.
L456418 +++$+++ u7217 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ PENTCHO +++$+++ Wait.  I want to tell you something.
L456417 +++$+++ u7216 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ MIA +++$+++ I didn't want to leave things the way we did.  Not this time.
L456379 +++$+++ u7216 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ MIA +++$+++ And glow happily ever after.
L456378 +++$+++ u7217 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ PENTCHO +++$+++ That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
L456377 +++$+++ u7216 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ MIA +++$+++ Dysfunctional --
