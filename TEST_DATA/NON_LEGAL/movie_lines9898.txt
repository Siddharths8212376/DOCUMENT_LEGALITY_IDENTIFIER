L271819 +++$+++ u5793 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER DUKE +++$+++ That's the punchline. She's still alive, in stable condition. Another case of a geek trying to imitate the popular people of the school and failing miserably. Is that pate?
L271818 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Is she dead?
L271817 +++$+++ u5793 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER DUKE +++$+++ Hi everyone, door was open. Veronica, you missed it! Pauline and Whitney James were up there doing there suicide rap when the cops come in and announce that Martha Dumptruck tried to buy the farm. She gave the ticket girl at the Colfax theatre a suicide note then bellyflopped in front of a car.
L271733 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Heather.
L271732 +++$+++ u5793 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER DUKE +++$+++ Guess who?
L271684 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
L271683 +++$+++ u5793 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER DUKE +++$+++ Don't worry. We'll work something out.
L271216 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Well, you better move Holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed.
L271215 +++$+++ u5793 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER DUKE +++$+++ Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in the Catcher in the Rye wouldn't put up with their bogus nonsense.
L271211 +++$+++ u5793 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER DUKE +++$+++ Yeah, maybe.
L271210 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Maybe you should see a doctor.
L271114 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...
L271113 +++$+++ u5793 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER DUKE +++$+++ Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
L271851 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Sure.
L271850 +++$+++ u5794 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER MCNAMARA +++$+++ Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
L271849 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
L271848 +++$+++ u5794 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER MCNAMARA +++$+++ Probably....
L271847 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ If everyone jumped off a bridge, young lady, would you?
L271846 +++$+++ u5794 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER MCNAMARA +++$+++ But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
L271845 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.
L271844 +++$+++ u5794 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER MCNAMARA +++$+++ Suicide is a private thing.
L271843 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?
L271760 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ So did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight?
L271759 +++$+++ u5794 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER MCNAMARA +++$+++ Shit.
L271514 +++$+++ u5794 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER MCNAMARA +++$+++ Please Veronica. Put Billy the Kid on hold tonight, I'll never forget it.
L271513 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D.
L271512 +++$+++ u5794 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER MCNAMARA +++$+++ Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.
L271511 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
L271510 +++$+++ u5794 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER MCNAMARA +++$+++ Veronica. What are you doing tonight?
L271462 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L271461 +++$+++ u5794 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER MCNAMARA +++$+++ That was seriously warped, Veronica.
L271444 +++$+++ u5794 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER MCNAMARA +++$+++ Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
L271443 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.
L271255 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Give it up girl!
L271254 +++$+++ u5794 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER MCNAMARA +++$+++ No way, no day!
L271218 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Give me the clipboard.
L271217 +++$+++ u5794 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER MCNAMARA +++$+++ God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.
L271131 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.
L271130 +++$+++ u5794 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER MCNAMARA +++$+++ God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?
L271112 +++$+++ u5794 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER MCNAMARA +++$+++ God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me, blame Heather. She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. Back me up, Heather.
L271111 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ What's your damage, Heather? You ruined my...
L271951 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ You've got power, Veronica. Power I didn't think you had. The slate is clean.
L271950 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ I thought I...you..
L271949 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ You really fucked me up, Veronica.
L271945 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ What?
L271944 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ You know what I want, babe?
L271943 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?
L271942 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ The bomb, asshole!
L271941 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school <u>was</u> society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge.
L271940 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ How do you turn the fucker off?
L271939 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.
L271938 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.
L271932 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ You didn't say Simon Says.
L271931 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.
L271930 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Like father, like son. A serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs. Okay, so let's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground.
L271929 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ I knew that loose was too noose! I mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you!
L271895 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ No-o!
L271894 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ If you'll excuse me......
L271892 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting?
L271891 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.
L271889 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ I think I know Heather a bit better than you, okay? If she was going to slash her wrists, the knife would be absolutely spotless.
L271888 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
L271887 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ This knife is filthy.
L271886 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
L271885 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ You're still not listening! I'm not..
L271884 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Wait a....You're not listening! I'm not on your side....
L271883 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I love it. I usually go for whole sentences myself, but hey this is perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious...
L271882 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ "You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's call the whole thing off...Hold it!
L271881 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!
L271873 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back!
L271872 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ It's over, J.D.  Over!
L271871 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ I could be up for that. I've already started underlining <u>meaningful</u> passages in Heather's copy of Catcher in the Rye, if you know what I mean. So are we on?
L271870 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
L271869 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?
L271714 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Phase my ass! You'll be <u>back</u>! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back.
L271713 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....
L271712 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you.
L271711 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you.
L271710 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
L271709 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ We're breaking up. I am out!
L271702 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ May<u>be</u>.
L271701 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi?
L271700 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming has given us a chance to atone for...
L271691 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ You kids are making too much damn noise.
L271690 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ You can be so immature!
L271688 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Don't <u>even</u> talk about that stuff!
L271687 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
L271686 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.
L271678 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ I was just making it more special.
L271677 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Can't you see this is a special moment?
L271657 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ How do you think Mr. Kelly would react to a son with a limp wrist with a pulse?
L271656 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Your son's dead and you love him.
L271654 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?
L271653 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.
L271649 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Did not.
L271648 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Did to.
L271647 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Did not.
L271646 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Did to.
L271645 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ I did not want them <u>dead</u>.
L271644 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ You believed it because you wanted to believe it. Your true feelings were too gross and icky for you to face.
L271642 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Of course.
L271641 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ We killed them, didn't we?
L271622 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Remember he's left-handed.
L271621 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Kurt doesn't look too good.
L271617 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Don't move! I'll get him back!
L271616 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
L271615 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Did you miss him completely?
L271598 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go?
L271597 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
L271596 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
L271595 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Perrier water!
L271594 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ You know it. Oh man, I almost forgot. The one perfecto thing I picked up...
L271593 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ You must have had fun.
L271592 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick.
L271591 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Uh well hey, let's take a look at the homosexual artifacts I dug up. Now, prepare to be a little disappointed.
L271590 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Oh.
L271589 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ It doesn't work on small animals!
L271588 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K.
L271587 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
L271586 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.
L271585 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.
L271584 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.
L271583 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Incredible similarity.
L271582 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ First tell me this similarity is not incredible.
L271580 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.
L271579 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.
L271578 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ French.
L271577 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Do you take German?
L271576 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ You can't be serious? Hey listen, my Bonnie-and-Clyde days are over.
L271575 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time.
L271574 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ I don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks.
L271547 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.
L271546 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!
L271543 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.
L271542 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ What is this shit?
L271488 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Nice. The last time I saw my Mom, she was waving out the window of a library in Texas. Right, <u>Dad</u>?
L271487 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
L271486 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.
L271476 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Yeah. Scary stuff.
L271475 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now.
L271470 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Next channel, darling.
L271469 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Mute!
L271416 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ That's good. Have you done this before?
L271415 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ "I die knowing no one knew the real me."
L271414 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."
L271413 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
L271412 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
L271411 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
L271410 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
L271409 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ "To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."
L271408 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ "You might think what I've done is shocking..."
L271407 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ I can do Heather's handwriting as well as my own.
L271406 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
L271405 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Like a suicide thing?
L271404 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime. But if this was like a suicide thing.....
L271403 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ It's one thing to want somebody out of your life. It's another thing to serve them a wake-up cup of Drano.
L271402 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know.
L271401 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
L271400 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ What are we going to tell the cops? "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."
L271399 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
L271398 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ And your worst enemy.
L271397 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.
L271396 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup.
L271383 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ You're not funny.
L271382 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Chick-en.
L271381 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.
L271380 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Yeah, great.
L271379 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something.
L271377 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
L271376 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.
L271375 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
L271374 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
L271373 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her.
L271372 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself.
L271370 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.
L271369 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.
L271364 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ But before that, I'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out.
L271363 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Good plan.
L271362 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die.
L271361 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ I guess I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
L271360 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ There's a big difference between the most popular girl in the school and dead sperm.
L271359 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
L271358 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
L271357 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ See the condoms in the grass over there. We killed tonight, Veronica. We murdered our baby.
L271356 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Well then, I'll pray for rain.
L271355 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
L271354 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Killing her won't solve anything.
L271353 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
L271352 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius.
L271348 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set.
L271347 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know. I thank you.
L271342 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ I saw the croquet set-up in the back. Up for a match?
L271341 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ S'okay....
L271340 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.
L271296 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Maybe it's time for a vacation.
L271295 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
L271294 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ I don't really like your friends either.
L271293 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.
L271292 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University.
L271291 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
