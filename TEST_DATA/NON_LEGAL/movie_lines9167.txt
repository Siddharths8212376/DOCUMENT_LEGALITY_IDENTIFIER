L303818 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ This issue is a drop in the bucket. I can talk to you about what's in here. But I can't talk to you about anything else.
L303817 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Far as you go where?
L303816 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ ...but that's as far as I go...
L303812 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ How did a radical journalist from Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS?
L303811 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
L303810 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ I know what I have to know.
L303809 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Like what? Your sign?
L303808 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
L303807 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Look, I really don't have that much time...
L303806 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Black, black...
L303805 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ How do you like your coffee? Black?
L303803 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ That's room service. They usually knock first.  Come on in... Over here, please.
L303802 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Who's that?
L304522 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ No, you can.  Tell him to get on the fucking phone!
L304521 +++$+++ u1506 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE +++$+++ I can't say that!
L304520 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Alright, now listen to me. I want you -- I want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!
L304519 +++$+++ u1506 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE +++$+++ He doesn't seem to be listening...
L304518 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ What's happening?!
L304517 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Hello, can you hear me now?
L304516 +++$+++ u1506 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE +++$+++ What?
L304515 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ What about now?
L304514 +++$+++ u1506 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE +++$+++ You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
L304513 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Did he hear you?
L304511 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ No, no. Don't call the police!  Just tell him I'm on the phone with you... My name is Lowell Bergman... Just tell him that.
L304510 +++$+++ u1506 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE +++$+++ I think I need to call the police. He won't respond...
L304349 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Our favorite hotel, honey... I checked into Room 930. Odd choice? Huh?
L304348 +++$+++ u1500 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL'S VOICE +++$+++ Where you staying now?
L304347 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...
L304346 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Liane has filed for divorce...
L304345 +++$+++ u1500 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL'S VOICE +++$+++ What do you mean there is no family?
L304344 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ There is -- there is no family.
L304343 +++$+++ u1500 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL'S VOICE +++$+++ Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?
L304098 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!
L304097 +++$+++ u1500 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL'S VOICE +++$+++ I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
L304092 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
L304091 +++$+++ u1500 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL'S VOICE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L303995 +++$+++ u1500 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL'S VOICE +++$+++ You called me.
L303994 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all.  You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry.  So, what were you calling about?
L303992 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ I don't know what the fuck I really think! Are they doing it? Is some crank doing it? Are they doing it to make me feel paranoid? Are they doing it for real and don't give a shit what I think? I don't know! I don't fucking know.
L303991 +++$+++ u1500 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL'S VOICE +++$+++ Well, what do you really think, though?
L303990 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
L303989 +++$+++ u1500 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL'S VOICE +++$+++ What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
L303988 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
L303987 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ She's okay.
L303986 +++$+++ u1500 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL'S VOICE +++$+++ We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name.  Modern marriage.  How's Liane?
L303910 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ For example. James Burke, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson... when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the FDA... He didn't even wait for the FDA to tell him. He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America. Instantly. And then he developed the safety cap... Because, look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right? But he's also a man of science. He's not going to allow his company... to put on the shelf... a product that might hurt people.  Not like the Seven Dwarfs...
L303909 +++$+++ u1500 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL'S VOICE +++$+++ Just give me an example...
L304210 +++$+++ u1501 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MICHAEL MOORE +++$+++ Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could happen, don't you?
L304209 +++$+++ u1504 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ RICHARD SCRUGGS +++$+++ Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
L304208 +++$+++ u1501 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MICHAEL MOORE +++$+++ Right.
L304207 +++$+++ u1504 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ RICHARD SCRUGGS +++$+++ Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
L304206 +++$+++ u1501 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MICHAEL MOORE +++$+++ Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
L304205 +++$+++ u1504 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ RICHARD SCRUGGS +++$+++ Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.
L304647 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ "There are times... I wish I hadn't done it. But there are times that I feel compelled to do it..." "I've -- if you asked me if I would do it again or if it's -- do I think it's worth it. Yeah. I think it's worth it."
L304646 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ "You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?"
L304498 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ "The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
L304497 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ "I would bet on it."
L304166 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Yeah, there are times I wish I hadn't done it. There are times I feel compelled to do it. If you asked me would I do it again? Do I think it's worth it? Yeah, I think it's worth it.
L304165 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
L304164 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Poor communication skills.
L304163 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
L304162 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Most certainly.
L304161 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
L304160 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
L304159 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
L304158 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
L304157 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ The process is known as "impact boosting..." While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
L304156 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
L304155 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ You're gonna get your fix...
L304154 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
L304153 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ A delivery device for nicotine.
L304152 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ And that's what cigarettes are for...?
L304151 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
L304150 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ All of us did. There was this whole line of people... whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.
L304149 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ ...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
L304148 +++$+++ u1502 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MIKE WALLACE +++$+++ You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
L304249 +++$+++ u1503 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MOTLEY +++$+++ Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs and middles! So what?! You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face! Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record. And I'm going to take my witness' testimony! Whether the hell you like it or not!  Answer the question, Dr...
L304248 +++$+++ u1509 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ TOBACCO LAWYER +++$+++ Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...
L304247 +++$+++ u1503 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MOTLEY +++$+++ There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?
L304246 +++$+++ u1509 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ TOBACCO LAWYER +++$+++ Object!
L304245 +++$+++ u1503 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MOTLEY +++$+++ It acts as a...
L304244 +++$+++ u1509 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ TOBACCO LAWYER +++$+++ Object to the form!
L304243 +++$+++ u1503 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ MOTLEY +++$+++ It acts as a drug on the body?
L304242 +++$+++ u1509 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ TOBACCO LAWYER +++$+++ Object to the form of the question!
L304215 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ How does one... "go... to... jail?" What does my family do? Go on welfare? If my wife has to work? Who's going to look after the kids? Put food on the table? My children need me. If I'm not teaching... there's no medical... no medical... even on co- pay, that's like... Tuition...
L304214 +++$+++ u1504 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ RICHARD SCRUGGS +++$+++ Possibly, yes. That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. That's right...
L304213 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Jail?
L304176 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ When should we do this?
L304175 +++$+++ u1504 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ RICHARD SCRUGGS +++$+++ My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
L304174 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
L304173 +++$+++ u1504 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ RICHARD SCRUGGS +++$+++ Hello.
L303863 +++$+++ u1508 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ THOMAS SANDEFUR +++$+++ I appreciate all that, Jeff. But, upon reflection... we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.
L303862 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
L303861 +++$+++ u1508 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ THOMAS SANDEFUR +++$+++ That's why we hire scientists...
L303860 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ "Research..."  You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil...
L303859 +++$+++ u1508 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ THOMAS SANDEFUR +++$+++ Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
L303858 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ You threatening my family, now, too?
L303857 +++$+++ u1508 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ THOMAS SANDEFUR +++$+++ ...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
L303856 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Is that a threat?
L303855 +++$+++ u1508 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ THOMAS SANDEFUR +++$+++ Yeah, I know you do...  You know, I came up through sales. One of the reasons I was a great salesman, was I never made a promise I couldn't keep.  I knew that if I ever broke my promise I'd suffer the consequence...
L303854 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Chapter and verse.
L303853 +++$+++ u1508 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ THOMAS SANDEFUR +++$+++ Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind. Most people consider what they're saying... social skills... Jeffrey just charges right ahead.  Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff...
L303852 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ I'd rather play than talk about it.  What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
L303851 +++$+++ u1508 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ THOMAS SANDEFUR +++$+++ And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
L303850 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Seven...
L303849 +++$+++ u1508 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ THOMAS SANDEFUR +++$+++ Jeff's a premiere golfer... What are you, a two handicap?
L306527 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ So he says now! But if not for your cool headed intervention, his tantrum might have ended this schmoe's life and ruined his own... As for the sexual indiscretion which he imagined had taken place, wasn't it in fact he who had been sleeping with the pool man?
L306526 +++$+++ u1512 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ BONNIE +++$+++ They hate each other --
L306525 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
L306524 +++$+++ u1512 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ BONNIE +++$+++ He --
L306523 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
L306522 +++$+++ u1512 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ BONNIE +++$+++ Well, I wouldn't say --
L306521 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --
L306590 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ We'd better go before we get thrown out.
L306589 +++$+++ u1513 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
L306576 +++$+++ u1513 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.
L306575 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
L306574 +++$+++ u1513 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
L306573 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
L306572 +++$+++ u1513 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ You did good, Massey!
L306571 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
L306567 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Howard!
L306566 +++$+++ u1513 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Baby. You are so HOT!
L306563 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ -- we realized we'd always been very attracted to one another.
L306562 +++$+++ u1513 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ ...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
L306561 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to...
L306558 +++$+++ u1513 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Here. Got pictures.
L306557 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
L306554 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
L306553 +++$+++ u1513 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
L306546 +++$+++ u1513 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?
L306545 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
L306594 +++$+++ u1513 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.
L306593 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I'd just like to have a word with her.
L306592 +++$+++ u1513 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ What part?
L306591 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
L306586 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ -- and we are sure...
L306585 +++$+++ u1513 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
L306584 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
L306583 +++$+++ u1513 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
L306582 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ -- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
L306581 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I just want to make sure that you both --
L306580 +++$+++ u1513 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
L306569 +++$+++ u1513 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ You know, Miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but...  I like my women with two boobs.
L306568 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What a touching story.
L306565 +++$+++ u1513 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ I had no idea until after, but --
L306564 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No!
L306560 +++$+++ u1513 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
L306559 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
L306556 +++$+++ u1513 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Yep. My divorce just came through. Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a better deal! My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. But, I don't know. Guess I'm just a softie. After all Amanda and me were together for -- what -- you'd know better than me, Marylin. She was your best friend.
L306555 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?

L306550 +++$+++ u1513 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop.

L307092 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I'm sorry. That was unkind and -- but, we changed our minds.  Did you really mean what you said on the phone. It wasn't because you found out about Rex?
L307091 +++$+++ u1515 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You're calling me a pestilence? That's a hoot!
L307078 +++$+++ u1515 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Who's the pigeon?
L307077 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Triple!
