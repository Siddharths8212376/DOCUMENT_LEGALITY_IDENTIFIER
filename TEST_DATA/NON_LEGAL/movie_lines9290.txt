L413005 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ How am I supposed to get away?

L412886 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.
L412885 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ You killed him.
L412884 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Tell me why he's dead.

L412864 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Me?
L412863 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ What would you do in my place?
L412843 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Then I have time for a drink.
L412842 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ You get another chance in ten minutes.
L412805 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ You...
L412804 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
L412803 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ What about the gun?
L412802 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ The gun...
L412801 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Are you 'fucking with me!?
L412767 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ I'm the guy who's going to kill your daughter if you don't get moving.

L412716 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Unless you do what you're told. Go do it!
L412715 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ At one thirty my little girl is dead.

L412680 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ What's your point?
L412679 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ You're out of your mind.
L412676 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ She is presently at the Bonaventure Hotel. That's right near here.
L412675 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Yes, I'm listening.
L412674 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?
L412673 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Good.
L412672 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Yes, yes, I understand.
L412668 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ You wouldn't...
L412667 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay attention and your daughter won't be hurt.
L412654 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our friends.
L412653 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Daddy?
L412644 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Don't worry. She's good with kids.
L412643 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
L412639 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I'd like to know what...
L412638 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Come with us, sir.
L412635 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Yes.
L412634 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
L412633 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...
L412629 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ What?
L412628 +++$+++ u2275 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ Could I see some identification, sir?
L412947 +++$+++ u2273 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ KRISTA +++$+++ I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor.
L412946 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ We have to hurry.
L412943 +++$+++ u2273 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ KRISTA +++$+++ I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
L412942 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
L412933 +++$+++ u2273 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ KRISTA +++$+++ I think you're right.
L412932 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I think you better put that away.
L412930 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Okay...
L412929 +++$+++ u2273 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ KRISTA +++$+++ Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
L412928 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ But...
L412927 +++$+++ u2273 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ KRISTA +++$+++ I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will.
L412926 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Are you sure?
L412922 +++$+++ u2273 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ KRISTA +++$+++ He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute.
L412921 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.
L412917 +++$+++ u2273 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ KRISTA +++$+++ It's a little hard to trust you under the circumstances.
L412916 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
L412915 +++$+++ u2273 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ KRISTA +++$+++ I don't know.
L412912 +++$+++ u2273 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ KRISTA +++$+++ I don't see how they could be in on it. They're the best. They're hand- picked.
L412911 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ No! You can't! They're in on it.
L412910 +++$+++ u2273 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ KRISTA +++$+++ All right, let's just...let's get security in on this.
L412904 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
L412903 +++$+++ u2273 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ KRISTA +++$+++ Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
L412902 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ You don't understand. I'm going to trust you. And you have to trust me.
L412901 +++$+++ u2273 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ KRISTA +++$+++ Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant.
L412900 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ My wife always said I had a problem trusting people.
L412794 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ No, that's,..that's fine
L412793 +++$+++ u2273 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ KRISTA +++$+++ Is that something precious?
L413083 +++$+++ u2274 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ No, kisses to...
L413082 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ No. Kisses to you.
L413081 +++$+++ u2274 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ No...kisses to you.
L413080 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ All right. Kisses to you.
L413079 +++$+++ u2274 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ I promise.
L413078 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Will you promise me that?
L413076 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ He's doing it for you. No matter what anybody tells you, no matter who they are, he's doing it for you, because he loves you.
L413075 +++$+++ u2274 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ All right.
L413074 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right?
L413073 +++$+++ u2274 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ To be a hero?
L413072 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do.
L413071 +++$+++ u2274 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ Can we go now?
L413070 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I know you do, honey.
L413069 +++$+++ u2274 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ I'm tired. I want to.go now.
L413068 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Yes, sweetie, it's me.
L412713 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Over and out.
L412712 +++$+++ u2274 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ He has to say "over and out". Daddy, you have to say "over and out".
L412709 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Yes. Yes, I can hear you.
L412708 +++$+++ u2274 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
L412707 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Lynn!
L412625 +++$+++ u2274 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ Right.
L412624 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?
L412622 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Let' s do it.
L412621 +++$+++ u2274 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ Nods.

L412609 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ How did you see us kiss?
L412608 +++$+++ u2274 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ No way.
L412607 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
L412605 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ You never saw your Mom and me kiss like that?
L412604 +++$+++ u2274 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ On TV.
L412603 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?
L412589 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ We made it.
L412588 +++$+++ u2274 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
L412587 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me?
L413324 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Thanks for the tip.
L413323 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Thanks for the shine.
L413211 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.
L413210 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ What are you going to do!?
L413208 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ What are you going to do now?
L413207 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I don't know.
L413206 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Well?
L413161 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment.
L413160 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ What am I supposed to say to her?
L413157 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ What!?
L413156 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ You're going to go see her.
L413155 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Yeah.
L413154 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ You said there was only one person you knew wasn't in on this thing.
L413152 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Thank you.
L413151 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Irene is going to help.
L413150 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Hi.
L413149 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Meet Irene.
L413122 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Don't think I won't.
L413121 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Keep the change.
L413118 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L413117 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
L413116 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
L413115 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
L413114 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ So when she wanted a divorce...I was...I didn't know what I'd done wrong. I didn't see it. I didn't see it....
L413113 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Yeah, all right, listen...
L413112 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do.
L413111 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
L413110 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Then why'd you drag me into it?
L413109 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
L413108 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Oh, Jesus ...
L413107 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
L413106 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Who?
L413105 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
L413104 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation?
L413103 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Kill the Governor.
L413102 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ What are you supposed to do?
L413101 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
L413100 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
L413099 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them.
L413097 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Then don't let him be seeing you talking to me. I don't want him twisting my arm off.
L413096 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ That's right.
L413095 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
L413094 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ What?
L413093 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Cover your mouth.
L413092 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
L413091 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Mister, what are you dragging me into?
L413040 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?
L413039 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Please...
L413038 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
L413037 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Please. Something is going to happen...
L413036 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Oh, man...
L413035 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about.
L413034 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ I remember. The big tipper.
L413033 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ You remember me?
L412840 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
L412839 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
L412837 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Keep it.
L412836 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ It's a twenty.
L412835 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Keep it.
L412834 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ You got anything smaller?
L412831 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ Is within himself.
L412830 +++$+++ u2272 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
L412829 +++$+++ u2271 +++$+++ m146 +++$+++ GENE +++$+++ I said I have to do something.
