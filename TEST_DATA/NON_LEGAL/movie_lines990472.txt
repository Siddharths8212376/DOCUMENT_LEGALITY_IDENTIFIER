L633354 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You can't do that yourself?
L633353 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
L633352 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You want something?
L633351 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
L633350 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You want something, old man?
L633349 +++$+++ u8682 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BLIND MAN +++$+++ Hey!  You there!
L634037 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ This means something to you?  Jenny means something to me.
L634036 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
L634035 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
L634034 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Give it to me!
L634033 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Now, what's this?
L634028 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ My honor, that's what I'm fighting over. Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
L634027 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
L634026 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm stompin' your ass.
L633927 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
L633926 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
L633922 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?
L633921 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
L633920 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Oh, shit!
L633919 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Mister!
L633686 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
L633685 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I wasn't hitting on your girl!
L633684 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Stand up.
L633683 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Christ, I don't believe this!
L633682 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
L633681 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
L633680 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ 'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
L633679 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
L633677 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
L633676 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Mister, I'm calling you out.
L633675 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
L633674 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ You expect me to believe that?
L633673 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
L633670 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Make time?  Is everybody in this town on drugs?
L633669 +++$+++ u8693 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
L633668 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I wasn't doing anything.
L634146 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Two-hundred dollars...I'll do it!  I'll kill her!
L634145 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Two-hundred dollars?
L634144 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior.  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
L634143 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
L634137 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Don't Jake me boy! It's a big house. You probably didn't even make it out to the desert this afternoon...
L634136 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Come on, Jake --
L634135 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What are you talking about!
L634134 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?
L634128 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money.
L634127 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
L634126 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
L634125 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
L634124 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ It's the truth, Jake.
L634123 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Shhh! Liar.
L634122 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You came to take my wife from me?
L634121 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I came for Grace.
L634119 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ ...And he thought he'd clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper...and then maybe borrow $200 or $20,000, or $200,000...
L634118 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
L634117 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
L634116 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ It's not what you think, Jake.
L634115 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I guess this is what they call "ironee"? Hunh?
L634114 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I like Darrell.  He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out.
L634113 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!
L633881 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No!
L633880 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Next time you'll do just fine.
L633801 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.
L633800 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ ...I don't know.  Tell her you had to see her.  Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. Sweet talk the woman.  A young buck like you must be good at that.  Then ... maybe shift the conversation.  Get her thinking about that jeep of hers.  She loves that thing.  Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll want to take you for a ride.
L633799 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ And tell her what?
L633798 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I <u>know you</u>...  This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
L633797 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront?
L633796 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Be quiet, boy.  I got to figure this thing. I'm thinking. It can't be done at the house. It should be...
L633795 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
L633794 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.
L633793 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ How do you want it?
L633792 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
L633791 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead...  Well, looks like we got ourselves a contract.
L633790 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.
L633789 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
L633788 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ We're not talking about buying a car Jake. We're talking about killing your wife. It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
L633787 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ That's a bit much.
L633786 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I need thirteen.
L633785 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
L633784 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ How much could you get?
L633782 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little "games" she plays. Like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me. The bitch. She loved to play. She wants me to hit her and when I hit her she likes it. She tortures me. But she's family. She's my little girl. My baby. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. No. Not me. But you? You got the killing in you, boy...How much you want?
L633781 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You love her, but you hate her?
L633780 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
L633779 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you...  You're a jealous man Jake. If you can't have Grace to yourself...well, you're not the sharing kind.
L633778 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ And what does that make you?
L633777 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
L633776 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What makes you say that?
L633775 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You meant it.
L633774 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
L633773 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
L633772 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead.
L633771 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
L633770 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You're talking like a madman.
L633769 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'm not rambling.
L633768 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
L633767 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
L633766 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I did?
L633765 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
L633764 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I do.
L633763 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
L633762 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ About what you said this morning.
L633761 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Sweet Grace?  What about her?
L633760 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ About things.  About your wife.
L633759 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Talk?  About what?
L633758 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I was hoping we could talk.
L633757 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What can I do for you, lad?
L633562 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ This is a joke, right?  You just want to rattle me.  Right?
L633561 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ How do you know if you've never tried?
L633560 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
L633558 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Would you kill her?
L633557 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Would I what?
L633556 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Would you?
L633554 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I can tell you got a temper on you.
L633553 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Like you don't know.
L633552 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ "You can't shoot 'em!" I like that.  I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going under you.
L633551 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
L633550 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit.  A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh? Women.
L633549 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy that.  Beside, how can I blame you?  That Grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she?  Eh?
L633548 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Hey!
L633547 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Ah, I can smell it on you.
L633546 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Wait a second--
L633545 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
L633544 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
L633543 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
L633542 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
L633541 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Live there?
L633540 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ California...
L633539 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Darrell's a moron.
L633538 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
L633537 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ An overheated car.
L633536 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ "Bobby Cooper." What brings you to Superior, Coop?
L633535 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Bobby Cooper.
L633534 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I'm a solid man.
L633533 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ That's a solid name.
L633532 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
L633531 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah, I know.  More careful.
L633530 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You've got to be--
L633529 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Accident.
L633528 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Say, what happened to your hand?
L633527 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah...
L633526 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that. It's a funny thing, women.
L633524 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know.
L633523 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What the fuck do you want?
L633519 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ It ain't broke.
L633518 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You broke my nose!
L633517 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You can't just walk in here and walk out, you sonufabitch! I'm gonna tear you a new asshole!
L633513 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Grace, tell him.
L633512 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ A lot that means.
L633511 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
L633510 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
L633509 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
L633508 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
L633507 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I'm her husband.
L633506 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Who the hell are you?
L633505 +++$+++ u8688 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Who the hell is this!?
L634032 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Get away from me!
L634031 +++$+++ u8689 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
L633929 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Will you shut up!

L633925 +++$+++ u8689 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ What's your name anyway?
L633924 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What the hell are you talking about?
L633923 +++$+++ u8689 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
L633918 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?

L633914 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
