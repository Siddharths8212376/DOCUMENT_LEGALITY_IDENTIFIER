L452190 +++$+++ u7166 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LITTLE OLD LADY +++$+++ I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.

L452755 +++$+++ u7162 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ DE BRIS +++$+++ Sing a song!  Just sing a song!
L452754 +++$+++ u7167 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LSD +++$+++ Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up?
L452753 +++$+++ u7162 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ DE BRIS +++$+++ Oh, sing.  Sing!
L452752 +++$+++ u7167 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LSD +++$+++ Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.
L452751 +++$+++ u7162 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ DE BRIS +++$+++ What do you do best?
L452750 +++$+++ u7167 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LSD +++$+++ Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
L452749 +++$+++ u7162 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ DE BRIS +++$+++ I mean in show business.
L452748 +++$+++ u7167 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LSD +++$+++ Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
L452747 +++$+++ u7162 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ DE BRIS +++$+++ What have you done, LSD?
L452746 +++$+++ u7167 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LSD +++$+++ Lorenzo Saint DuBois.  But everybody calls me LSD.
L452911 +++$+++ u7163 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Send for Goebbels.
L452910 +++$+++ u7167 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LSD +++$+++ Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?
L452905 +++$+++ u7163 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ We can't... we keep our money there!
L452904 +++$+++ u7167 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LSD +++$+++ Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
L452903 +++$+++ u7163 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Who can we attack?  They're all too big.
L452902 +++$+++ u7167 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LSD +++$+++ No good, baby, no good.  You heard my orders.  Nobody retreats. Attack!  Attack!
L452901 +++$+++ u7163 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ We are falling back on all fronts. Our soldiers are retreating.
L452918 +++$+++ u7167 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LSD +++$+++ Groovy!
L452917 +++$+++ u7164 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ GOEBBELS +++$+++ We won.
L452916 +++$+++ u7167 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LSD +++$+++ Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out?
L452915 +++$+++ u7164 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ GOEBBELS +++$+++ I told them we invaded England.
L452914 +++$+++ u7167 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LSD +++$+++ What did you tell the people?
L452913 +++$+++ u7164 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ GOEBBELS +++$+++ Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
L452912 +++$+++ u7167 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LSD +++$+++ He's the only cat left that still grooves me.
L454272 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ All right!  Might save me a lot of leg-work if I could just talk to your mother.  But I'd need a warrant for that, won't I?
L454271 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
L454270 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
L454269 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss.
L454268 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ No. I told you, she's confined...
L454267 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ Your mother met her?  Can I talk to your mother?
L454266 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But...  She didn't fool my mother.
L454265 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
L454264 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
L454263 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
L454262 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Now, look...!
L454261 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ If she paid you well?
L454260 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Of course not.
L454259 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
L454258 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ She's... ill. Confined to her room. It's practically living alone.
L454257 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ My mother.
L454256 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ Someone is sitting in that window.
L454255 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I live there. Alone.
L454254 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ Anyone at home?
L454253 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.
L454251 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Look, if you won't believe me, go ahead. You can help me make beds if you like.  Come on.
L454250 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
L454249 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Not at all!
L454248 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ She isn't still here, is she?
L454247 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
L454246 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
L454245 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
L454244 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ And when she left, she never came back.
L454243 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Cash.
L454242 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ Cash or check? For the cabin...
L454241 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What?
L454240 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ How did she pay you?
L454239 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
L454238 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
L454237 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What do you mean?
L454236 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ Back where?
L454235 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.
L454234 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ How do you know she didn't make a call?
L454233 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ No! Of all...
L454232 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
L454231 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ No.
L454230 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
L454229 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ No.
L454228 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ Or arrived with her.
L454227 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ No.
L454226 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ No one met her?
L454225 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ The following morning. Sunday.
L454224 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ Of which morning?
L454223 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Very early. Dawn.
L454222 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ How early?
L454221 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
L454220 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ Tell me all about her.
L454219 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess.
L454218 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I didn't lie to you. I just have trouble keeping track of... time.
L454217 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ Don't know where she got "Marie," but "Samuels" figures. Her boy friend's name is Sam.  Was she in disguise? Or do you want to check the picture again?
L454214 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ You thought no one has stopped here in weeks. Now, try to remember if this girl...
L454213 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What?
L454212 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?
L454210 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I don't even bother with guests registering any more... I mean, little by little, you drop the formalities.  I shouldn't even bother to change the linen. I guess habits die hard. Which reminds me...
L454209 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
L454208 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ No. At least I don't recall.
L454207 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ Look at the picture. Please.
L454206 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
L454205 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
L454204 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
L454203 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
L454202 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Oh.
L454201 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ I'm not the police.
L454200 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
L454199 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
L454198 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
L454197 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ No.
L454196 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You out to buy a motel?
L454195 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ No trouble. Today's linen day. I change all the beds once a week, whether they've been used or not... dampness. I hate the smell of dampness.  It's such a dank smell.
L454194 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
L454193 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
L454192 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
L454191 +++$+++ u7177 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
L454167 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't believe it.  Do you?
L454166 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
L454165 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...
L454154 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What are you talking about?  What is this?
L454153 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ Must've needed it.
L454152 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Why?
L454151 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ Your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars.
L454150 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! I can take so much and then...
L454149 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ Money.
L454148 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What's your interest?
L454145 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ Milt Arbogast, Private Investigator.  Where is she, Miss Crane?
L454144 +++$+++ u7180 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Who are you, friend?
L454143 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ Let's all talk about Mary.
L454164 +++$+++ u7173 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...
L454163 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
L454162 +++$+++ u7173 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Not even a hunch. Just hope.
L454161 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?
L454159 +++$+++ u7173 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Sam, if she's here...
L454158 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ Casharoonie!
L454157 +++$+++ u7173 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
L454156 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ Someone has seen her. Someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars.  She is your girl friend, isn't she?
L454147 +++$+++ u7169 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ ARBOGAST +++$+++ Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.
L454146 +++$+++ u7173 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ I don't know.
L453978 +++$+++ u7170 +++$+++ m482 +++$+++ CAR DEALER +++$+++ Okay. If you'll come along...
