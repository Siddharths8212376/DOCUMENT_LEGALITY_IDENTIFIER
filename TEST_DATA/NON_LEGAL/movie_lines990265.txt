L483678 +++$+++ u7439 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ YEAH!
L483673 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Yeah, you gotta go 'YEAH', strength.  Poor little man.
L483672 +++$+++ u7439 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Yeah.
L484426 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Just knowing a person like that exists, knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'I still can't help loving you'. That's gotta be a good thing, right?  That's gotta be a good thing.
L484425 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Just her name.
L484424 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.
L484423 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
L484422 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I know this part, keep reading.
L484421 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ "You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."
L484419 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I'm incarcerated, Lloyd!  I don't deserve to lose my daughter over this.  I don't deserve to have you as my go-between.  And I can't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion in mediocrity the way she flirts around you.
L484418 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir.  Are you alright sir?  Are you okay?
L484417 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.
L484416 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
L484415 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Very talented.
L484414 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I know
L484413 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ She's very successful.
L484412 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I know.
L484411 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride.  You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.
L484410 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Am I going?  Am I going to England?  I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right?  What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy?  There's no way.
L484409 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Are you?
L484408 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
L484407 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
L484406 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ She wouldn't get out of the car.  I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car.  But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's gonna, um...
L484312 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I just wanted to say that I've thought about everything, and I've decided something.  I'm going to give you another chance.  Maybe no one's listening, or maybe your father's listening.  Mr Court, if you're listening to this, hello, how are you?
L484311 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
L484310 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Hi, Lloyd.  This is my eighth and final call...
L484043 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.
L484042 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No, really.
L484041 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I'm totally and completely serious.
L484040 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Seriously, Lloyd.
L484039 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
L484038 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yeah Lloyd.  What are your plans for the future?
L484034 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well, we pay for the [?].  That guy didn't want to part with it, a little matter of nine thousand dollars.
L484033 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ How do you pay for one of those?
L484032 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Thanks Lloyd.
L483798 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yeah.  Honey?
L483797 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ How ya doing?  Is she around?
L483796 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Fine Lloyd.
L483795 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Hello.  Heard about that graduation present.  Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back.  I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink.  Kickboxing.  You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  I can see by your face, no.  My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
L483794 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Hello Lloyd.
L483793 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Hi.  Lloyd Dobler, sir.  Pleasure to meet you.
L483731 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Jim Court... no, this is her father.  I'll take...
L483730 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
L483729 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
L483728 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ She's really pretty great, isn't she?
L483727 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What?
L483726 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
L483725 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Okay, I'll give here the message.
L483724 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.
L483723 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.
L483722 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall.
L483721 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ The truck?
L483720 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ No.
L483719 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ The guy with the Datsun?
L483718 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ No.
L483717 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Is this the guy with the Mustang?
L483716 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Uh... okay... um...
L483715 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
L483714 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Hello.  May I please speak with Diane please?
L483713 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Jim Court?
L484297 +++$+++ u7441 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Dude, I can't do it!
L484296 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Diane Court.
L484280 +++$+++ u7441 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Your car?
L484279 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ My car.
L483890 +++$+++ u7441 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Dude, why do you think I keep her tapes?  They're going to be valuable some day.
L483889 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Stop freaking with her head man.  Just stop playing with her mind, you know?  She's a human being.  She's a person.  She's very talented, you know.
L483888 +++$+++ u7441 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ So what's up?
L483887 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.
L483867 +++$+++ u7445 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MISS EVANS +++$+++ Hang tough, Lloyd.
L483866 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.
L483865 +++$+++ u7445 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MISS EVANS +++$+++ Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you.
L483862 +++$+++ u7445 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MISS EVANS +++$+++ We'll just make an appointment for you at Seattle Junior College.
L483861 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings.  I mean, there's no possible way.
L483860 +++$+++ u7445 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MISS EVANS +++$+++ Don't make this like a counsel, Lloyd. I got statistics I can show you, I got graphs I can show you.  That's all the stuff I can show you, it all says the same thing.  You have to decide on a career.
L483856 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ What?
L483855 +++$+++ u7445 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MISS EVANS +++$+++ Lloyd.
L483854 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ No way.
L483853 +++$+++ u7445 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MISS EVANS +++$+++ You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
L483852 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ How ya doin' Miss Evans?
L483851 +++$+++ u7445 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MISS EVANS +++$+++ Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.
L483938 +++$+++ u7444 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I don't really know where we are.
L483937 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ How you doin', brother?
L483936 +++$+++ u7444 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Ooop, excuse me.
L483840 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Alright.  Key?
L483839 +++$+++ u7444 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ This is great, this gives me hope.  Thanks.
L483838 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I'm Lloyd Dobler.
L483837 +++$+++ u7444 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Yeah, but how come it worked?  I mean like, what are you?
L483836 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I called her up.
L483835 +++$+++ u7444 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
L483834 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Yeah.
L483833 +++$+++ u7444 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?
L483832 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ What?
L483831 +++$+++ u7444 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Mike Cameron, how you doing?
L483830 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Hey.
L483829 +++$+++ u7444 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Oh boy.
L483931 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.
L483930 +++$+++ u7449 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ VALHERE +++$+++ Certainly.
L483911 +++$+++ u7449 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ VALHERE +++$+++ Diane, everybody loves that you showed up.
L483910 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
L483909 +++$+++ u7449 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ VALHERE +++$+++ I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
L483908 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I don't know.
L483907 +++$+++ u7449 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ VALHERE +++$+++ You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up.  Why am I yelling?
L483815 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I was just going to kind of move around.
L483814 +++$+++ u7449 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ VALHERE +++$+++ Thanks a lot Lloyd.
L483813 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I was gonna...
L483812 +++$+++ u7449 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ VALHERE +++$+++ A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
L483811 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Oh, I was just going to...
L483810 +++$+++ u7449 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ VALHERE +++$+++ Wow, man.  Well.  Listen man, I need you to be the keymaster.
L483809 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You know Diane Court?
L483808 +++$+++ u7449 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ VALHERE +++$+++ It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?
L484274 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
L484273 +++$+++ u7443 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Later for you, Luke.
L483920 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Yeah, alright.
L483919 +++$+++ u7443 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ We're full on bonded.
L483918 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
L483917 +++$+++ u7443 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I love you man.
L483916 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
L483915 +++$+++ u7443 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Give me my firebird keys!
L483828 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I love you too.
L483827 +++$+++ u7443 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I love you man
L483821 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Alright!
L483820 +++$+++ u7443 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ We finally graduated, big dude guy!
L486268 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
L486267 +++$+++ u7450 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ BRINNLITZ GUY 2 +++$+++ Now you're back.
L486266 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
L486265 +++$+++ u7450 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ BRINNLITZ GUY 2 +++$+++ Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
L486264 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
L486263 +++$+++ u7450 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ BRINNLITZ GUY 2 +++$+++ Oskar - my friend Lena.
L485991 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
L485990 +++$+++ u7451 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
L485989 +++$+++ u7451 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ Klaus Tauber.
L485988 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
L485987 +++$+++ u7451 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ Sir, the list is correct.
L485986 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ What's your name?
L485985 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ I'm talking to a clerk.
L485984 +++$+++ u7451 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.
L485983 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ Well, let's find him.
L485982 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ He is.
L485981 +++$+++ u7451 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
L485980 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ He's essential.  Without him, everything comes to a grinding halt.  If that happens -
L485882 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ It's up to you.
L485881 +++$+++ u7452 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ EMILIE +++$+++ Should I stay?
L485880 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ It's a beautiful city.
L485879 +++$+++ u7452 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ EMILIE +++$+++ Should I stay?
L485878 +++$+++ u7452 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ EMILIE +++$+++ I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
L485877 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ What?
L485875 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ War.
L485874 +++$+++ u7452 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ EMILIE +++$+++ Luck.
L485872 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ A charade?  How could it be a charade?
L485871 +++$+++ u7452 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ EMILIE +++$+++ It's not a charade, all this?
L485863 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ You would, though.  That's what I'm saying.
L485862 +++$+++ u7452 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ EMILIE +++$+++ I don't have to like her just because you do.  It doesn't work that way.
L485861 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ What -
L485860 +++$+++ u7452 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ EMILIE +++$+++ Oskar, please -
L485859 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ You know what, you'd like her.
L486337 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ Breslau?  I can't go to Breslau.  Not now.
L486336 +++$+++ u7453 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ GESTAPO +++$+++ In Breslau.
L486335 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ All right, okay, let's talk.
L486334 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave.
L486333 +++$+++ u7453 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ GESTAPO +++$+++ There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
L486332 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ I'm sorry to hear that.
L486331 +++$+++ u7453 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ GESTAPO +++$+++ Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
L486477 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.
L486476 +++$+++ u7454 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ GOETH +++$+++ Where are the guards?
L486286 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  What's a person worth to you.
L486285 +++$+++ u7454 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ GOETH +++$+++ Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.
L486284 +++$+++ u7454 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ GOETH +++$+++ You did, but you didn't.
L486283 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ I just told you.
L486282 +++$+++ u7454 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ GOETH +++$+++ If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?
L486280 +++$+++ u7454 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ GOETH +++$+++ Yeah, sure.
L486279 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them.  It's good for you - you'll be compensated.  It's good for the Army.  You know what I'm going to make?  Artillery shells.  Tank shells. They need that.  Everybody's happy.
L486278 +++$+++ u7454 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ GOETH +++$+++ You're not telling me something.
L486277 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ Look -
L486276 +++$+++ u7454 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ GOETH +++$+++ Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense.
L486275 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ It's good business.
L486274 +++$+++ u7454 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ GOETH +++$+++ What are you, Moses?  What is this? Where's the money in this?  What's the scam?
L486273 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ These people, my people, I want my people.
L486272 +++$+++ u7454 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ GOETH +++$+++ You want these people.
L486255 +++$+++ u7454 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ GOETH +++$+++ I don't know.  Soon.
L486254 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ When?
L486253 +++$+++ u7454 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ GOETH +++$+++ They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
L486252 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ You took my workers.
L486214 +++$+++ u7454 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ GOETH +++$+++ I got a shipment of Hungarians coming in, I got to make room for them.  It's always something.
L486213 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ What's going on?
L486212 +++$+++ u7454 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ GOETH +++$+++ I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought.  Have a drink.
L486096 +++$+++ u7454 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ GOETH +++$+++ I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
L486095 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
L486094 +++$+++ u7454 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ GOETH +++$+++ He's important to my business.
L486093 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ You held back Stern.  You held back the one man most important to my business.
L486091 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ I pay you too much.
L486090 +++$+++ u7454 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ GOETH +++$+++ It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
L486064 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ Well, you've been through it.  You know. You could make things easier for me.
L486063 +++$+++ u7454 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ GOETH +++$+++ Do you have any idea what's involved? The paperwork alone?  Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy.  Then the engineers show up.  They stand around and they argue about drainage - I'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, I've been through it, I know.
L486061 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ True.
L486060 +++$+++ u7454 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ GOETH +++$+++ That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
L486059 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ Yeah, what's that?
L486058 +++$+++ u7454 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ GOETH +++$+++ Scherner told me something else about you.
L486057 +++$+++ u7454 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ GOETH +++$+++ Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do?  You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done.  Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example.  But that's good business.
L486056 +++$+++ u7460 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ SCHINDLER +++$+++ It's bad business.
L486055 +++$+++ u7454 +++$+++ m504 +++$+++ GOETH +++$+++ We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
