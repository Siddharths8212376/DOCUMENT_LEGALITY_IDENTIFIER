L464458 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I gave them me.  Said some nice things about me, Rudy. I appreciate it. But don't worry. I do love her. And she loves me. You had that right all along.
L464457 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ You gave them me.
L464456 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
L464455 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Hm. Well. They'd have killed you if you weren't me, Rudy. We knew you'd start convincing 'em soon enough.
L464454 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
L464453 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
L464450 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
L464449 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Do what?
L464448 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ How'd you know I'd do it.
L464447 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up...  Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man.
L464446 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Always wanted to rob that casino, Rudy. Way back when I worked there. What better way than to get some guys to rob it for me.
L464445 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ And you set me up.
L464444 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
L464443 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ She set them up. All of them.
L464442 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
L463632 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ NICK!!!
L463631 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ ...for Christmas...

L463625 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Tell her... I'll be there ...
L463624 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ No, man! No, no, no!
L463623 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Ash... Ashley...
L463622 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ GUARD!!!
L463621 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
L463620 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
L463619 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Jesus, Rudy --
L463618 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ GUARD!!!
L463617 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Alamo...
L463616 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ GUARD! GUARD!
L463612 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Standing right here, man!
L463611 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Don't move, Rudy!
L463610 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
L463609 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Rudy, don't move --
L463598 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Good for you. Protein.
L463597 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Just a roach, Zook.
L463593 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Hotwiring cars, Rudy, does not qualify as a small business. Chop shop consultant; doesn't work on a resume.
L463592 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I don't know, I've seen the business world.
L463591 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
L463590 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ What, working security?
L463589 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work.
L463575 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Aw, Rudy.
L463574 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
L463573 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Don't look like he missed the sunlight.
L463570 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Five years, Nicky. Five years.  I just want to go home.
L463569 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Thought you hate your old man.
L463568 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Just taste that Christmas turkey.
L463567 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Thought you hated Sidnaw.
L463566 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
L463564 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Shoulda written, Rudy...
L463563 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
L463562 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
L463561 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Oh.
L463560 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
L463559 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ She's using a new perfume.
L463558 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Me and her got a connection.  Read this part. Read the part about stuffing her stocking.
L463557 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ What if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. You just don't do it for her.
L463555 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick.
L463554 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
L463551 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy.
L463550 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I'm just talking.
L463549 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Why you gotta. We were gonna give you a ride someplace, man. Now I just don't know.
L463548 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I'm just saying.
L463547 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Why you gotta say a thing like that.
L463545 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.
L463544 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
L463543 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Yeah.
L463542 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
L463541 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Yeah.
L463540 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting.
L463539 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ And some pecan pie.
L463538 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ And a slice of pecan pie, right?
L463537 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
L463536 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What?
L463535 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Hot chocolate.
L463534 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Fuckin' Christmas, man. Fuckin, Christmas on the outs.
L463533 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Not yet.
L463532 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Three days, man.
L463531 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Ain't there yet.
L463530 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
L463529 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
L463528 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Hell you haven't.
L463527 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Haven't thought about it.
L463526 +++$+++ u2600 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do?
L464336 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ THEY'LL OPEN ONE!
L464335 +++$+++ u2601 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ OLD TIMER +++$+++ There is no other table --
L464334 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
L464333 +++$+++ u2601 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ OLD TIMER +++$+++ I'm ninety-two years old --
L464332 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
L464331 +++$+++ u2601 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ OLD TIMER +++$+++ What? No...
L464330 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Switch seats with me.
L464319 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ You're hitting for MY cards!
L464318 +++$+++ u2601 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ OLD TIMER +++$+++ But... I had a five...
L464317 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ POP! That was My card!
L464306 +++$+++ u2601 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ OLD TIMER +++$+++ Well...sorry...
L464305 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ That was my king!
L464304 +++$+++ u2601 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ OLD TIMER +++$+++ I... sorry, Mister...
L464303 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ That was my card, pop! My card! You hit for my card!
L464183 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I got an idea on that one. Once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. There's a security camera room that videotapes everything. You've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes.
L464182 +++$+++ u2602 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ PUG +++$+++ Without having them hit the alarms.
L463935 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ They changed the layout.
L463934 +++$+++ u2602 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ PUG +++$+++ Map is kinda dirty, Monster...
L463929 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Since when? What the hell is this room?
L463928 +++$+++ u2602 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ PUG +++$+++ That's what it looks like!
L463921 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Who the hell made this map.
L463920 +++$+++ u2602 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ PUG +++$+++ Start talkin
L463817 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I'M NOT NICK!
L463816 +++$+++ u2602 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ PUG +++$+++ Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.
L465827 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ Now I'm not gonna bullshit you. I don't really care about what you know or don't know. I'm gonna torture you for awhile regardless. Not to get information, but because torturing a cop amuses me. There's nothing you can say, I've heard it all before. There's nothing you can do. Except pray for a quick death, which you ain't gonna get.
L465826 +++$+++ u2608 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ Yes.
L465825 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?
L465824 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?
L465823 +++$+++ u2608 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
L465822 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ Thanks, don't mind if I do.
L465821 +++$+++ u2608 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
L465820 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ Now where were we?
L465819 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ Alone at last.
L465761 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You don't hafta lift shit. You don't really work there. But as far as the records are concerned, you do. I call up Matthews, the foreman, tell him he's got a new guy. You're on the schedule. You got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week. And ya know dock workers don't do too bad. So you can move into a halfway decent place without Scagnetti thinkin "what the fuck." And if Scagnetti ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day. That day we sent you to Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit you needed to unload there. You're at the Taft airstrip pickin' up a bunch of shit and bringing it back. Part of your job is goin' different places - and we got places all over the place.
L465760 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ I don't wanna lift crates.
L465757 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ I wanna. But I gotta show this asshole I got an honest-to-goodness job before he'll let me move out on my own. I can't work for you guys and be worried about gettin' back before ten o'clock curfew.
L465756 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You're coming back to work for us, right?
L465755 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.
L465754 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.
L465753 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ Seymour Scagnetti.
L465749 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
L465748 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
L465747 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
L465746 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
L465745 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
L465744 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ You fuckin' wish.
L465737 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ No. That your head's been up your ass. I walk through the door and Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank god. Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up." And I say "Well, Joe, I coulda told you that." "I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin' toilet! "  I'm not tellin' tales out of school. You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself.
L465736 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ That I should've picked you up?
L465735 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
L465734 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time.
L465733 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ Fine, now.
L465732 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ How ya doin', Toothpick?
L466024 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!
L466023 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make.
L466018 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ How do you know all this?
L466017 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ The motherfucker killed Vic.
L465995 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
L465994 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.
L465949 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Was he all pissed off?
L465948 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.
L465935 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ No. She was from Ladora Heights.
L465934 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Where was she from, Compton?
L465933 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
L465932 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Elois?
L465931 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Let me tell you guys a story. In one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named Elois.
L465797 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ A snake charmer, what the fuck d'you think. I'll call a doctor, take care of him, fix 'm right up. No, where's Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue?
L465796 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Who?
L465795 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I'll call somebody.
L465794 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ You ain't dying, he is.
L465793 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.
L465778 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
L465777 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!
L466004 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ That's okay, Eddie, I do.
L466003 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.
L465768 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Daddy, I got an idea. Now just hear it out. I know you don't like to use any of the boys on these jobs, but technically, Vic ain't one of the boys. He's been gone for four years. He ain't on no one's list. Ya know he can handle himself, ya know you can trust him.
L465767 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
L465766 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Nuts. We got a big meeting in Vegas coming up. And we're kinda just gettin ready for that right now.
L465763 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
L465762 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
L465759 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.
L465758 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ We can work this out, can't we?
L465752 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Really? Who's your P.O.?
L465751 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
L465743 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Guy got me on the ground, tried to fuck me.
L465742 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What?
L465741 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Daddy, did ya see that?
L465997 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?
L465996 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.
L465942 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Well, whoever she was, Elois looked like her. So one night I walk into the club, and no Elois. Now the bartender was a wetback, he was a friend of mine, his name was Carlos. So I asked him "Hey, Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?" Well apparently Lady E was married to this real piece of dog shit. I mean a real animal. And apparently he would so things to her.
L465941 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
L465940 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
L465939 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Pam Grier.
L465938 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
L465937 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."
L465936 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills."
L465926 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.
L465925 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.
L465818 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ There is no fuckin' set up!  Look, this is the news. Blondie, you stay here and take care of them two. White and Pink come with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front, he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you.
L465817 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
L465816 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What does it matter who stays with the cop? We ain't lettin' him go. Not after he's seen everybody. You should've never took him outta your trunk in the first place.
L465805 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Well, let's go get it. We also gotta get rid of all those cars. It looks like Sam's hot car lot outside.  You stay here and babysit Orange and the cop.  You two take a car each, I'll follow ya. You ditch it, I'll pick you up, then we'll pick up the stones. And while I'm following you, I'll arrange for some sort of a doctor for our friend.
L465804 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
L465803 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
L465802 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
L465801 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I take it this is the bastard you told me about.  Why the hell are you beating on him?
L465799 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
L465798 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue.
L465788 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.
L465787 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ I don't know, but somebody did.
L465786 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
L465785 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
L465784 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
L465783 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
L465782 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Bullshit.
