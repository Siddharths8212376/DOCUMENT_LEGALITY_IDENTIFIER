L31818 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm a werewolf.
L31758 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Good. I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room.
L31757 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Now I'm embarrassed.
L31756 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
L31755 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
L31754 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
L31753 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Not just a patient -- me.
L31752 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
L31751 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Will you think about it?
L31750 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
L31749 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
L31748 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What?
L31747 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Will you come with me?
L31746 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
L31745 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
L31744 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ That's easy enough.
L31743 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
L31742 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
L31741 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm sorry I woke you up.
L31740 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Hello. You all right?
L31736 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...
L31735 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yes, go on.
L31734 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
L31733 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What? Oh, yes, please.
L31732 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Shall I read to you?
L31731 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ My best friend. My very best friend.
L31730 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
L31729 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Now what do you want to talk about?
L31728 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I know.
L31727 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm twenty-seven.
L31726 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Twenty-eight.
L31725 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ How old are you?
L31724 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ That's not really a very proper question.
L31723 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ How old are you?
L31722 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ It's okay. I want to talk to you.
L31721 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
L31720 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I dream of death mostly.
L31719 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What do you dream about?
L31718 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
L31717 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Do you like it?
L31716 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ 'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
L31715 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I was. What are you reading?
L31714 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I thought you were asleep.
L31713 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You're a very beautiful girl.
L31688 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Will you give me a break?
L31687 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Let's try a little harder, shall we?
L31686 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Right.
L31685 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
L31684 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
L31683 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Call me David.
L31682 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
L31681 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Aw come on, Alex!
L31680 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Call me Alex.
L31679 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Aw come on, Miss Price!
L31678 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Sorry.
L31677 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
L31676 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
L31675 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ How is that?
L31674 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
L31673 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Please, really. I'm not hungry.
L31672 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I'm afraid you have to eat something.
L31671 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm not very hungry, thank you.
L31670 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You haven't eaten your lunch.
L31669 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yes?
L31668 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Mr. Kessler?
L31589 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ A wolf.
L31588 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What?
L31587 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ It was a wolf.
L31586 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L31585 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ It wasn't a lunatic.
L31935 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I thought not.
L31934 +++$+++ u270 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BENJAMIN +++$+++ No.
L31933 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
L31932 +++$+++ u270 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BENJAMIN +++$+++ No!
L31931 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No what?
L31930 +++$+++ u270 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BENJAMIN +++$+++ No.
L31929 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ How are we feeling tonight?
L31660 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Right.
L31659 +++$+++ u270 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BENJAMIN +++$+++ No.
L31658 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
L31657 +++$+++ u270 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BENJAMIN +++$+++ No.
L31656 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Feeling better?
L31655 +++$+++ u270 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BENJAMIN +++$+++ No.
L31654 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
L31653 +++$+++ u270 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BENJAMIN +++$+++ No.
L31652 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No what?
L31651 +++$+++ u270 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BENJAMIN +++$+++ No.
L31650 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Hello, Benjamin.
L31539 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.
L31538 +++$+++ u278 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ MISS GALLAGHER +++$+++ I looked.
L31537 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Why on earth do you say that?
L31536 +++$+++ u278 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ MISS GALLAGHER +++$+++ I think he's a Jew.
L31535 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Chart says he's from New York.
L31534 +++$+++ u278 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ MISS GALLAGHER +++$+++ He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
L31533 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
L31532 +++$+++ u278 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ MISS GALLAGHER +++$+++ He all right?
L31649 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
L31648 +++$+++ u279 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ MRS. HOBBS +++$+++ Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
L31647 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Has he been refusing food?
L31646 +++$+++ u279 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ MRS. HOBBS +++$+++ Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
L31645 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
L31644 +++$+++ u279 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ MRS. HOBBS +++$+++ Miss Price.
L32104 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ That's what I want you to do, you moron!
L32103 +++$+++ u271 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BOBBIE +++$+++ You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
L32102 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Who is this girl?
L32099 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!
L32098 +++$+++ u271 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BOBBIE +++$+++ Now see here young man.
L32097 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
L32096 +++$+++ u271 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BOBBIE +++$+++ There's no call for that kind of language.
L32095 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
L32094 +++$+++ u271 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BOBBIE +++$+++ All right, you two, move along.
L32089 +++$+++ u271 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BOBBIE +++$+++ You did, did you?
L32088 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Officer, I killed those people last night.
L32171 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Why are you doing this to me?
L32170 +++$+++ u272 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BRINGSLY +++$+++ No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
L32169 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.
L32161 +++$+++ u272 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BRINGSLY +++$+++ You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
L32160 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
L32159 +++$+++ u272 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BRINGSLY +++$+++ This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
L32158 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
L31475 +++$+++ u283 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ You could have told them!
L31474 +++$+++ u273 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ CHESS PLAYER +++$+++ No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
L31429 +++$+++ u283 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ That's very funny, that is.
L31428 +++$+++ u273 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ CHESS PLAYER +++$+++ Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.
L31421 +++$+++ u273 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ CHESS PLAYER +++$+++ No. You've had your chance.
L31420 +++$+++ u283 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Oh, come on, tell us.
L31419 +++$+++ u273 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ CHESS PLAYER +++$+++ All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
L31418 +++$+++ u283 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
L31417 +++$+++ u273 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ CHESS PLAYER +++$+++ You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
L31416 +++$+++ u283 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ No, but we're about to.
L31415 +++$+++ u273 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ CHESS PLAYER +++$+++ Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
L31642 +++$+++ u278 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ MISS GALLAGHER +++$+++ Bambi?
L31641 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
L31640 +++$+++ u278 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ MISS GALLAGHER +++$+++ Some, everyone does.
L31639 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Do you have bad dreams, too?
L31638 +++$+++ u278 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ MISS GALLAGHER +++$+++ An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
L31637 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What are you going to see?
L31636 +++$+++ u278 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ MISS GALLAGHER +++$+++ Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
L31635 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Alex?
L31634 +++$+++ u278 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ MISS GALLAGHER +++$+++ It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
L31633 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What time is it?
L31632 +++$+++ u278 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ MISS GALLAGHER +++$+++ Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.
L31630 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I was having a nightmare.
L31629 +++$+++ u278 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ MISS GALLAGHER +++$+++ Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
L31712 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
L31711 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.
L31709 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Believe me. The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's. And if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud, a fake.
L31708 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
L31707 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
L31706 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
L31705 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ I really don't know.
L31704 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
L31703 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
L31702 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Did you see Jack?
L31701 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
L31700 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
L31699 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Yes.
L31698 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
L31697 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
L31696 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
L31695 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ You've never had bad dreams before?
L31628 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.
L31627 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
L31626 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
L31625 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ So they said.
L31624 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ There were witnesses?
L31584 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
L31583 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Lunatic?
L31582 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
L31581 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Two weeks?
L31580 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
L31579 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ How long have I been here?
L31573 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
L31572 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
L31564 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.
L31563 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
L31562 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
L31561 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
L31560 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ You're in a hospital in London.
L31559 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Where am I?
L31558 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.
L32177 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
L32176 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I could hang myself.
L32173 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ How shall I do it?
L32172 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Because this must be stopped.
L32156 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway. We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.
L32155 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Hello.
L32154 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
L32153 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I want you to meet some people.
L32152 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
L32151 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What about the zoo?
L32150 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
L32149 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Thank you.
L32148 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You look awful.
L32147 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ If I was still alive, I probably would.
L32146 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
L32145 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You don't have to say anything.
L32144 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What can I say, Jack?
L32143 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Hi, David.
L32142 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Hi, Jack.
