L147099 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.
L147098 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.
L147022 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Everyone get some sleep.    We're leaving in the morning.
L147021 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
L147020 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ That moron.
L147000 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I think he's already figured that out.
L146999 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
L146698 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!
L146697 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Besides, we don't know the city and--
L147648 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
L147647 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Did you have to use that much explosive?
L147513 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ You better.
L147512 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ I will.
L147511 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
L147510 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Does it really matter what I say?
L147509 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ You haven't answered my question.
L147508 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
L147507 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
L147506 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
L147505 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Can I trust you, Sami?
L147504 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ What?
L147480 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Some bread and...
L147479 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ What'd you get?
L147478 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Anybody hungry?
L147477 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
L147476 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
L147461 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.
L147460 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Hello?
L147435 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.
L147434 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.
L147407 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ No?
L147406 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ It's not your fault, Daniel.
L147257 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Has to be.
L147256 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Hadley --
L147237 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
L147236 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ All right, knock it off.
L147228 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.
L147227 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
L147109 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ We have to find Sophie.
L147108 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
L147107 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
L147088 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ No.   Chicks dig me.
L147087 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
L147086 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.
L147014 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
L147013 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?
L146973 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ That's Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.
L146972 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ It's not?
L146953 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ I'll be Elvis and you--
L146952 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Good idea.
L146951 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.
L146812 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
L146811 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
L146723 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
L146722 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ This is Zero.
L147559 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ There's just one more thing I need you to do.
L147558 +++$+++ u4662 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ LAMAR +++$+++ Okay, we're square now, right?
L147325 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I'll tell you when it's time.
L147324 +++$+++ u4662 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ LAMAR +++$+++ What?
L147323 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do.
L147273 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Fine.     Ten o'clock.
L147272 +++$+++ u4662 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ LAMAR +++$+++ We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
L147271 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ We had a deal.
L147270 +++$+++ u4662 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ LAMAR +++$+++ Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
L147269 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ -- Did you set it up?
L147268 +++$+++ u4662 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ LAMAR +++$+++ Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was just watching the news and--
L147267 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ It's me.
L147266 +++$+++ u4662 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ LAMAR +++$+++ Yeah?
L147204 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Fine.
L147203 +++$+++ u4662 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ LAMAR +++$+++ A thousand dollars?
L147202 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ How much?
L147201 +++$+++ u4662 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ LAMAR +++$+++ And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee.
L147200 +++$+++ u4662 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ LAMAR +++$+++ I ain't no rat.  You got money, right?
L147199 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Why haven't you turned us in?
L147198 +++$+++ u4662 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ LAMAR +++$+++ Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
L147197 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I'm from Belgium.
L147196 +++$+++ u4662 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ LAMAR +++$+++ I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
L147195 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I've got a way with people.
L147194 +++$+++ u4662 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ LAMAR +++$+++ I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
L147193 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Don't bullshit me.
L147192 +++$+++ u4662 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ LAMAR +++$+++ Man, I can get anything.
L147191 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Guns.   Can you get them?
L147190 +++$+++ u4662 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ LAMAR +++$+++ What do you want now?
L147189 +++$+++ u4658 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I'll be right back. He gets out of the car and walks over to him.
L147114 +++$+++ u4659 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Hard to say.
L147113 +++$+++ u4665 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAPHAEL +++$+++ Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
L147041 +++$+++ u4665 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAPHAEL +++$+++ I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?
L147040 +++$+++ u4659 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
L147039 +++$+++ u4665 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAPHAEL +++$+++ Hector, don't interrupt me.
L147038 +++$+++ u4659 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ -- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
L146905 +++$+++ u4665 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAPHAEL +++$+++ -- Don't think. Okay?        You're not good at it.
L146904 +++$+++ u4659 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ I just thought that--
L146903 +++$+++ u4665 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAPHAEL +++$+++ Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
L146902 +++$+++ u4659 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Maybe you should call the police.
L147593 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Great fuckin' song.
L147592 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ Good song though.
L147591 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.
L147492 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry.
L147491 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.
L147062 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ Okay boss.
L147061 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Just find them!
L147060 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
L147059 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
L147058 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ Okay boss.   Where are they?
L147057 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
L147056 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
L147055 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
L147054 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ Boy, you must be pissed.
L147053 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Everything.
L147052 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ Everything?
L147051 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Everything.
L147050 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ What'd they take?
L147049 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Yeah, French guys from France.
L147048 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ French guys?    You mean like from France?
L147047 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ They were all French guys.
L146866 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
L146865 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ Hey boss, it's not a science.
L146804 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ That's right. I said don't do it. Did you listen to me? No. You wanted the money. So, I lent you twenty large. Now it's been three weeks and you ain't paid a dime. What do you think that makes me look like on the street? I don't do something to you and everyone will think they can skate.
L146803 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ You said don't do it, boss.
L146802 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that?  What'd I say to him?
L147433 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ Go look.
L147432 +++$+++ u4669 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ UNIFORMED COP +++$+++ I don't know.     I didn't look.
L147431 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ What room number?
L147430 +++$+++ u4669 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ UNIFORMED COP +++$+++ The Holiday Hotel.
L147429 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ What hotel?
L147428 +++$+++ u4669 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ UNIFORMED COP +++$+++ A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
L147427 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
L147426 +++$+++ u4669 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ UNIFORMED COP +++$+++ No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
L147425 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
L147424 +++$+++ u4669 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ UNIFORMED COP +++$+++ Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
L147423 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ And the other car?
L147422 +++$+++ u4669 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ UNIFORMED COP +++$+++ Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
L147421 +++$+++ u4660 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JOEY "TWO TONS" +++$+++ What'd you guys find?
L147006 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ Go where?   The police are outside.
L147005 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ I was told to take what we have and go.
L147004 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ What do we do?
L146967 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ There must be half a million dollars here though.
L146966 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
L146965 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ There has to be.
L146919 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Oh yeah.
L146918 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
L146917 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ The map said to go left.
L147019 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ No.    145 Ridgeroad Way.
L147018 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
L147017 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Yes.
L147016 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
L147015 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ No, I didn't.
L146814 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ You can use my car.
L146813 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ What about transportation?
L146810 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem.
L146809 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom.
L146785 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ Oh, then we will have the house wine.
L146784 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ They don't have a wine list.
L147280 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.
L147279 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.
L147262 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?
L147261 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ We've got to get out of here.
L147260 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I?  I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
L147259 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
L147258 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?
L147101 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.
L147100 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?
L147097 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
L147096 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
L147009 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ C'mon, get real, will you. You think he's just going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about honor. He's coming after us, so we might as well take the money.
L147008 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ I don't know.     Maybe if we did just leave --
L146791 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ Okay.    I will have a beer.
L146790 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ This kind.
L146789 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
L146788 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ They don't serve wine here.
L146721 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Hey, I was told to come here by Marcel. You guys don't want me, I'll be more than happy to leave.
L146720 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ I see.   A master criminal.
L146719 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
L146718 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ What is it you do, Sami?

L147398 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.
L147397 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I knew I should have driven.
L147369 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ This is the only American car you've ever driven.
L147368 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.
L147367 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ I've never driven a Cadillac before.

L147326 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I am not comfortable with this.   I'm not a good liar.
L147079 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.
L147078 +++$+++ u4661 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ JULIEN +++$+++ Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.

L147413 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ No.   How much?
L146679 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
L146678 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
L146677 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ What the hell is he talking about?
L146676 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
L146675 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
L146674 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.
