L54118 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ So?
L54117 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ You know, there is one thing I can't figure out. All along they've been bugging me about those files and when I told them I'd burned all that stuff, they went nuts - they told the Consul guy they were medical records?
L54116 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ I could try and get a Western lawyer.
L54115 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Now you're using that word.
L54114 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ WE gotta think of something.
L54113 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Well, the trial's in two weeks, but I think they've already sentenced me. They just need to check if Siberia can slot me in.
L54112 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ You're kidding.
L54111 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.
L54110 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ What happened?
L54109 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
L54108 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
L54107 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Damn!
L54106 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ No, but I ran into Jahn, seems him and his friends are in big trouble with the University, they might even be expelled.
L54105 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ They're good guys..... Have you seen Holly?
L54104 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Honza says they'll print an open letter to President Havel in next weeks edition even if they have to threaten a walk-out.
L54103 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ He got that one right.
L54102 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ I stopped by your office. Henry was steaming, he says he's going to throw you out of the window and that you never worked at the Bugler.
L54101 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ They ain't the only ones.
L54100 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.
L54099 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Huh?
L54098 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ So I hear.
L54097 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Your too good for this town, Buddy.
L54096 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ That bad?
L54095 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ I don't want to ruin your day.
L54094 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Tell me some bad news?
L54093 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Chris! Tell me some good news.
L54023 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ He's lying! I am.
L54022 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ It's me you want, I'm responsible for all this.
L54002 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Hey Jahn.....You got a name for this thing?
L54001 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Does Jahn's thing have a name?
L54000 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ The performance is free what more do you want....I've set that old phone up as a donation box and I'll get Jahn to write out a sign....Okay, let's get going.
L53999 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ You capitalist pig!
L53998 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Shit no, it'll be twice cost.
L53995 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Good, and then type up a notice on your computer for tonight's thing, photocopy it and put it up in all the faculty buildings and a couple of the pubs. It'll start at eight o'clock and the bar will be open from seven. Holly and I'll go and get some beer and wine.  Can you bankroll the bar for tonight?
L53994 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it.
L53993 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
L53992 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ What?
L53991 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Chris, can you do me a favour?
L53972 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Nothing, it's just that's when things usually start to go wrong.
L53971 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
L53970 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Don't tell me you really are in love?
L53969 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Well, I take it you're going to drag her down to your minimal existence and adjust her mindset.
L53968 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ What are you on about?
L53967 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ A fine specimen for conversion.
L53966 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ She's cool.
L53965 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
L53964 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ It just happened.
L53963 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?
L53962 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Holly!
L53961 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ You Romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes - anyone I know?
L53960 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
L53959 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ What happened to Katka?
L53958 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No, the boyfriend.
L53957 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ And a tram hit you?
L53956 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I fell in love.
L53955 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ My God! What happened?
L53842 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ I can't, I've got to split. I have to take a class at two o'clock.
L53841 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Thanks. Come on Chris, give me a hand.
L53822 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ What?
L53821 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No, We aren't going to do it.
L53820 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
L53819 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Get me a couple of beers and a salami.
L53794 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ You're all bloody useless.
L53793 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ No, not yet.
L53792 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Have you cleared all the rubble up?
L53787 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Forget it Doug, it's no good.
L53786 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I see, you've got your hands too far up your collective arse to pull it out long enough except to drink my bloody wine.
L53771 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Both, see you later.
L53770 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Red or white?
L53769 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No, it could take me hours. You know what it's like trying to find things in this town, not to mention disposable stuff - I wouldn't think they've ever heard of them.
L53768 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Why don't we go together?
L53767 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups.
L53766 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Not on the opening night, wouldn't look right.
L53765 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ No beer?
L53764 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Here, let's both put in two hundred crowns. That should get nine or ten bottles of wine.
L53763 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No, I figure once they see the place and we get'em a little drunk, they'll all want to help. We should have that floor done in a day or so.
L53762 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
L53761 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ We'd better get some booze in for tonight.
L53760 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.
L53759 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit?
L53758 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Well, I think I_ve got a handle on the Czech pysche and I reckon this kind of joint will make _em reminisce about the sixties. Plus we should get a few stray expat_s looking for Kafka.
L53757 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Do you think anyone will really come here?
L53743 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ When your ready Son!
L53742 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Like a hand?
L53741 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Who put a bee up your butt?
L53740 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No, not if you've got better things to do.
L53739 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Am I late?
L53738 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Afternoon!
L53728 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ We don't speak Czech!
L53727 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ So why didn't we?
L53726 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway.
L53725 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Why don't we just take the whole damn building, brick by brick Doug.
L53724 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
L53723 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Let's split.
L53721 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Stealing's stealing, we might as well get what we need. This'll do for the floor and the walkway too.
L53720 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
L53719 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ We're going to need it all.
L53718 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ It looks new, they might miss one or two.
L53717 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Perfect!
L53714 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ They'll never get us.
L53713 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
L53712 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
L53711 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Close!
L53710 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No, for the Asylum.
L53709 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Like helping a sick kid?
L53708 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
L53707 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Nope.
L53706 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Have you ever stolen anything?
L53705 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Destroy the evidence huh.
L53704 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I had a better idea, we'll burn them. There's a drum across the road; I was just waiting for the workers to go home.
L53703 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ I thought you were gonna throw these?
L53698 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ We got a party tomorrow night. Can't have the place smelling like shit.
L53697 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Moved on to plumbing huh?
L53679 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ You'd be better off with tables and chairs.
L53678 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
L53677 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Yeah, her name's Kavlova, why?
L53675 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Yeah, I'll take some.
L53674 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Need any disks?
L53647 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Is it gone four-thirty?
L53646 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Look I gotta get going, shouldn't you have met Katka?
L53645 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Don't worry if the old lady's there I'll brick it back up.
L53644 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
L53643 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
L53642 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
L53641 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Well, it's definitely there - We've just got to get to it.
L53640 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Just think though, it would make a hell of a cafe, that way we keep the auditorium clear.
L53639 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
L53638 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
L53637 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ And suppose a little old lady lives there?
L53636 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
L53635 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Don't we have enough already?
L53634 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I'd love to get in there.
L53632 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I don't know. This wall isn't like the rest though, it's not all that old either.
L53631 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ But how did the wall get here?
L53630 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ It must be on the other side of this.
L53629 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No, it's welded up!....Let's take a look from the inside.
L53628 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Can you do the lock on it?
L53627 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I don't know but that used to be a window and I think that was a door.
L53621 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Just save me a little patch and I'll do it later.
L53620 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Yeah, I'm beginning to see that.
L53619 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Perfect, but I can't use it right now, I've got to get these locks done; it's a matter of priorities.
L53616 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Yes, but it suddenly clicked, this is going to be a crazy place and, since the Commies are used to seeking asylum, we can use that in the marketing.
L53615 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ I've been saying that since we met.
L53614 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
L53613 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
L53612 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No....The Asylum!
L53611 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
L53610 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
L53609 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ I'm an idiot?
L53606 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Tough break.
L53605 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Yeah, that was Honza's idea, I had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear.
L53604 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ 'cause you stink of booze.
L53603 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No, why?
L53600 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Good, I love swinging a shovel.
L53599 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ I'll try not to, I'll leave that to you. Anyway, there's still plenty more of it.
L53598 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Well, don't get carried away.
L53597 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
L53596 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?
L53538 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ You're nuts man, Katka's right!
L53537 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Yep, except a name for this place.
L53536 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Thought of everything haven't you.
L53535 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Tell them we're working for the University.
L53534 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?
L53533 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
L53532 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
L53531 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I'm making history Chris, nothings going to stop me. There could be a knighthood for us in this, once President Havel hears.
L53530 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ A locksmith too? Why d'you ever bother with writing?
L53529 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.
L53528 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ I thought that was part of the charm!
L53527 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
L53526 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
L53525 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Not bad hey, I think I'll add Sparkie to my resume.....Good shovel!
L53522 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ You sure got a handle on that word "we".
L53521 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Well, we might as well start filling it in now. As long as you leave enough room around that end of the pipe - so I can get to it, we're set. Use them wooden boards to stop it all spilling into the space - We'll neaten it up later.
L53520 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ So?
L53519 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Somehow, I'm going to have to band-aid that thing since we can't really replace it and then put a walkway over it.
L53518 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Sure....As for the crap, I've got an idea.
L53517 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ And put it on expenses?
L53516 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
L53515 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Just two things. What do I use to shift the stuff and where in hell am I gonna put it all?
L53514 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Don't worry, I'll give you a hand as soon as I can.
L53513 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ I feel like a mole in this joint, so I guess I might as well come out lookin' like one!
L53512 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Too right....Now the other thing we've got to do is start clearing up the rubble. Can you make a start on that?
L53511 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ That makes you an expert I guess.
L53510 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No, he was talking about girls, I think.
L53509 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ He was an electrician?
L53508 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No, but like my dad said, "There's only so many ways you can wire a plug".
L53503 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Yeah, that could be job number two. I think it's a sewer.
L53502 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ That stinks!
L53461 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Great. Let's say nine o'clock here tomorrow. Catch you later partner.
L53460 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ No, I got nothing till Tuesday.
L53456 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ You got my word on it.
L53455 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
L53454 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
L53453 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
L53452 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Chris, what if I were to cut you in as partner in this project - together we could make it swing, all it needs is a good clean out and the power on, then we're in business.
L53451 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ No thanks, I think we ought to get going though.
L53450 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ You were right Jahn, it's a great space..... Hey, Chris. Do you want to come and look?
L53440 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ We could make a run for it?
L53439 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Okay, it's in here somewhere. Let's keep it quiet.
