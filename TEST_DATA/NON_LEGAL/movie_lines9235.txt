L357463 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Was this your idea?
L357460 +++$+++ u1900 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ Oh, you mean my pigeons.
L357459 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ You know, each time I see you, I hear that music. What is it?
L357458 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ hope you'll forgive me for—
L357457 +++$+++ u1900 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ My name's Sondra.
L357456 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Oh, please. I hope you're not going to run away this time.
L357654 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Yes.  Barney!
L357653 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You'll wait till you rot!
L357652 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
L357651 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
L357650 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
L357649 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
L357648 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Go? Where?
L357647 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ How about you? Do you want to go?
L357231 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ We didn't get much information out of him, did we Bob?
L357230 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ That's what I mean - mysterious. Mr. Conway, I don't like that man. He's too vague.
L357205 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ The first thing we want to do is to cable the Foreign Office. All of England is waiting to hear about my brother. There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready to take him back.
L357204 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse us, we're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home.
L357147 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ English!
L357146 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Why, he's speaking English.
L357130 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.
L357129 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ What is it?
L357082 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.
L357081 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What do you want him to do?
L357026 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ It's Fenner.
L357025 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
L357024 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
L357023 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?
L356938 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ How could I know that a war was going to break out right over my head!  Right over my head. Oh, my word! I tell you, those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
L356937 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It would serve you right if you were left behind.
L357539 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You'll tell me some of the things I want to know, won't you?  You'll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what they're going to do with us!
L357538 +++$+++ u1899 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ Thank you.
L357537 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ All right, I'll be there.
L357536 +++$+++ u1899 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you.  Please . . .
L357535 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Perhaps.
L357534 +++$+++ u1899 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
L357533 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
L357532 +++$+++ u1899 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
L357278 +++$+++ u1899 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ Please don't go.
L357277 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ EXCUSE ME–
L381603 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Lose your name and identity, work endless hours an behalf people who don't know you exist, and abandon any hope that you might one day feel even the slightest bit sure of your place in the universe.
L381602 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ And if I say yes?
L381601 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ It's easy.  You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after.
L381598 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Oh, you'll still, be guarding him.
L381597 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Once I thought the biggest thing I'll ever do was guard the president.
L381591 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ I gotta be honest about something.
L381590 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ No. just peace on Earth.
L381589 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ And Goodwill Toward Man?
L381588 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
L381576 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ You got smeared.
L381575 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ I guess I lost:
L381574 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
L381573 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ What the hell...
L381572 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ ...touch that.
L381567 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ It's not even a fucking door.
L381566 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
L381565 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.
L381564 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?
L381558 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth?
L381557 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
L381556 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Cowan--
L381555 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Wait.  Uh-- sir.  Please.  Anyway.  Hook-head-guy.  I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--
L381554 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Cowan--
L381553 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Sir, before you boot me, I just want to explain.  I mean, okay, you got a goat-guy with a hook for a head...
L381549 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Obvious?  Why don't you and I have a little talk about the obvious... outside.
L381548 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
L381547 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ The hell were you thinking?
L381546 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
L381545 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ You shot an eight year old girl.
L381544 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about your choice of targets.
L381543 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Hesitated, sir.
L381542 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ The hell happened?
L381643 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ No. But You'll get used to it.    Welcome to the Men in Black.
L381642 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ It'll make sense later?
L381641 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ His physics are a little different than ours.  Don't worry
L381640 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ So... wait.  You just asked... but he goes so fast, he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it.
L381634 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Hang on. -- And this is the good part; when you're fully ordained, he'll come when you call him, too.  Dave.
L381633 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
L381632 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Hell of an assistant, isn't he?  Damn guy moves so fast, he actually gets there before you even ask for him.
L381630 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Yes, air? -- OOOMPH.
L381629 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Everybody, listen up: we've had a tremendous amount of movement lately. Be aware.  Be safe.  Have a good day.  Oh, uh... Cowan?
L381606 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L381605 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ From now on, you'll respond only to the name "Jay." You'll dress in appropriate attire specially sanctioned by the INS Special Services. You're not to stand out in any way.  Understand?
L381600 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ What happens if I say no?
L381599 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Only the damn guy won't know it.
L381594 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Mrs. Edelson?
L381593 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ No-- it makes sense.  Cause I gotta tell ya, when I was in third grade they told me I was crazy cause I swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something.
L381592 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ You think we're nuts.
L381538 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ We're the government, Cowan.
L381537 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Sir.  I thought those records were sealed.
L381536 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
L381535 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
L381521 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ I... I don't know, air.  This guy. Mr. "Best of the best of the best... " I don't know.  It's just still find it a little...  humorous.  I'm sorry.  Sir.
L381520 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ What's so funny, cadet Cowan?
L381513 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ They don't.  Now, son.  If you get the job, you're going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways.  Here's a little piece of advice:    Don't use this so much.
L381512 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ They don't?
L381511 +++$+++ u1913 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ ZED +++$+++ Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
L381510 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ ... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
L381505 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.
L381504 +++$+++ u1911 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ You do?
L381503 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ All the time, sir.
L381502 +++$+++ u1911 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
L381501 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Actually, sir--
L381500 +++$+++ u1911 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
L381499 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Then where did it-- ? Sir.  Forgive me, but it makes no sense. worked my ass off to grad--
L381498 +++$+++ u1911 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ Well this didn't.
L381497 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Bull... loney- Sir.  I'm sorry.  Sir, I'm sorry. Sir.  I just, I find it hard to believe that it didn't come from you.  I mean, everything here comes from you.
L381496 +++$+++ u1911 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ Actually, it didn't come from me.
L381495 +++$+++ u1901 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ COWAN +++$+++ Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
L381494 +++$+++ u1911 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ Sorry, Cowan, I found out literally just before the ceremony.' Apparently you're to report for further review.
L382055 +++$+++ u1902 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ DEE +++$+++ Kay...
L382054 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.
L382020 +++$+++ u1902 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ DEE +++$+++ Home?  You gotta be kidding me.    Black?
L382019 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
L382018 +++$+++ u1902 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ DEE +++$+++ 'Hell, I may as well do something useful.
L381475 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Yup.  Sure is.
L381474 +++$+++ u1902 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ DEE +++$+++ Helluva night, isn't it?
L381464 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Don't worry about it.
L381463 +++$+++ u1902 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ DEE +++$+++ Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
L381462 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Grab the coffee, will ya?  I told Zed I'd give him a buzz.
L381461 +++$+++ u1902 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ DEE +++$+++ Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
L381460 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I wasn't scared...
L381457 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Don't worry about it.  It's been a long night.  Speaking of which-- you owe me a cup of coffee, remember?
L381456 +++$+++ u1902 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ DEE +++$+++ Kay, listen, I dunno what got into--
L381439 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Don't worry about it.  Four-Eyes'll run a track on him.  We'll get that son of a... whatever the hell he's the son of.
L381438 +++$+++ u1902 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ DEE +++$+++ Kay, I'm sorry...
L381437 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Little more burn on the perimeter-they weren't roasting smores here. Dig out this hole a little.  Cmon, I know it's late, but the sooner we get it right, the sooner we'll all be home.
L381433 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ What?  I thought you just--
L381432 +++$+++ u1902 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ DEE +++$+++ Oh. Shit. it's in the car--
L381431 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Mikey.  Hold it, Mikey-- I want you to talk to me.  Mikey.  I'm telling you.. don't make me... Mikey   Gimme the 140.
L381406 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Three, huh?  Really? Cause a cup of coffee says we're talking about... number... four?  Huh?  No?
L381405 +++$+++ u1902 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ DEE +++$+++ I'd go with number three.
L381404 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Which do you have your money on, Dee?
L381455 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ You heard me.  You two, especially.
L381454 +++$+++ u1903 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ INS LEADER +++$+++ What?
L381453 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Underground gas vein.  Next time, be more careful when you shoot off your guns.
L381447 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Actually that's a very good question.  The answer-- if You'll Just look at this Part-- is here.
L381446 +++$+++ u1903 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ INS LEADER +++$+++ Why?  What are you gonna do?
L381445 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it.  This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain.  More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.   I said I need you to look right here.
L381415 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ DON'T "SIR" ME-- YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH.

L382275 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
L382274 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs out with dead people.

L382146 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...
L382136 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I'd double it and add 20.
L382135 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Would you call this a code 100?
L382120 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ All of it?
L382119 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ It's marble.
L382114 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?
L382113 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ We saw it in the office.  It went from this big...    to big...   in a day.
L382112 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ For how long?
L382111 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Maybe they didn't get here.  Maybe they've been here.
L382103 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Since as long as we've been keeping records...
L382102 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Since how long?
L382045 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing.    That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury.  Did it leave when everything else left?
L382044 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ What are you doing?
L382040 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ That's my point.  For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.  He said our enemy in already here.  Well maybe it is.  Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.
L382039 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
L382038 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
L382037 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
L382036 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Kay.  All I'm saying--
L382035 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Great.  Fine.  Listen, why don't we call the pentagon, maybe they'll take you back with the new age well wishers.  I'll stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs.
L382034 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
L382033 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ How does that help me?
L382032 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?
L382031 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ He's here to help!?
L382028 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Hang on.  There's gotta be something on this guy.    Did you contact the Alliance?  Do they have anything?
L382027 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Kay--
L382016 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ You know something?  I actually never think of that.  I gotta get some coffee.
L382015 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ What if he's telling the truth?
L382014 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Oh, yeah?  Fill us in, why don't you.
L382000 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I dunno, man.  Maybe we should.
L381999 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ "Perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs..."
L381945 +++$+++ u1904 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ The Pentagon.
L381944 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?
L381926 +++$+++ u1906 +++$+++ m125 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ We're rising.
