L194163 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Well, anyway... Sorry.
L194162 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
L194161 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
L194160 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Why wouldn't you think that about me?
L194159 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ See, I wouldn't think that about you.
L194158 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
L194157 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
L194156 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
L194155 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I'm not nuts.
L194154 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
L194153 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I don't know what that means.
L194152 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Huckleberry Hound?
L194151 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I don't know any jokes about your name.
L194150 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
L194149 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I'm Joel.
L194148 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ My name's Clementine, by the way.
L194147 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Yeah, I got it.
L194146 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
L194145 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
L194144 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Oh, I doubt that's the case.
L194143 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
L194142 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ You sure? That doesn't sound --
L194141 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
L194140 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I'm sure you would.
L194139 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
L194138 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
L194137 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
L194136 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I don't really know how --
L194135 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
L194134 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I can't remember.
L194133 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
L194132 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
L194131 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
L194130 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I like it.
L194129 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
L194128 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
L194127 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
L194126 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I don't have one.
L194125 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
L194124 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ -- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
L194123 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
L194122 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Really? Because --
L194121 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
L194120 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right?
L194119 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
L194118 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Rockville Center.
L194117 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
L194116 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ It's okay, really.
L194115 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
L194114 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --
L194113 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Oh. So...
L194112 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
L194111 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
L194110 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
L194109 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
L194108 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Well, I didn't want to assume.
L194107 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Really?
L194106 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so...
L194105 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
L194104 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Why what?
L194103 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Why?
L194102 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L195096 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Jesus.
L195095 +++$+++ u860 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE'S VOICE +++$+++ Your dried cum.
L195094 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I don't know. Panties and --
L195093 +++$+++ u860 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE'S VOICE +++$+++ Guess what I'm wearing.
L195092 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ You must have been crazy.
L195091 +++$+++ u860 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE'S VOICE +++$+++ God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
L195090 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
L195089 +++$+++ u860 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE'S VOICE +++$+++ Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
L195088 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Hi, it's Joel.
L195058 +++$+++ u860 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE'S VOICE +++$+++ Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
L195057 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Look, I have to go. I have to think.
L195056 +++$+++ u860 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE'S VOICE +++$+++ I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
L195055 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ It's true.
L195052 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
L195051 +++$+++ u860 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE'S VOICE +++$+++ Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
L195050 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
L195049 +++$+++ u860 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE'S VOICE +++$+++ I probably got the same thing as you.
L195048 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Did you send this? Is it a joke?
L195047 +++$+++ u860 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE'S VOICE +++$+++ Yeah?
L195024 +++$+++ u860 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE'S VOICE +++$+++ Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
L195023 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I guess so.
L195022 +++$+++ u860 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE'S VOICE +++$+++ Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
L195021 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Oddly enough, I do.
L195020 +++$+++ u860 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE'S VOICE +++$+++ Hmmm. Do you miss me?
L195019 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I just walked in.
L195018 +++$+++ u860 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE'S VOICE +++$+++ What took you so long?
L195012 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
L195011 +++$+++ u865 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ NAOMI'S VOICE +++$+++ That's me.
L195008 +++$+++ u865 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ NAOMI'S VOICE +++$+++ Long day thinking.
L195007 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I just got in.
L195006 +++$+++ u865 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ NAOMI'S VOICE +++$+++ Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
L195005 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I know. I had to take the day to think.
L195004 +++$+++ u865 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ NAOMI'S VOICE +++$+++ Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
L195003 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ How's it going?
L195002 +++$+++ u865 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ NAOMI'S VOICE +++$+++ Hi.
L195001 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
L194940 +++$+++ u871 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ VOICE-OVER +++$+++ I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
L194939 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
L194926 +++$+++ u871 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ VOICE-OVER +++$+++ I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
L194925 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Clementine.
L194893 +++$+++ u871 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ VOICE-OVER +++$+++ Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
L194892 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ So you're still on the Zoloft?
L194861 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ But I went back to my food. The next thing I remember, I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye.
L194860 +++$+++ u871 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ VOICE-OVER +++$+++ I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
L194859 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
L194841 +++$+++ u871 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ VOICE-OVER +++$+++ This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.
L194840 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Okay. I wish you could come.
L194779 +++$+++ u871 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ VOICE-OVER +++$+++ On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.
L194778 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Naomi.
L194691 +++$+++ u871 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ VOICE-OVER +++$+++ I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.
L194690 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.
L194583 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
L194582 +++$+++ u871 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ VOICE-OVER +++$+++ She's so sexy.
L194522 +++$+++ u871 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ VOICE-OVER +++$+++ Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
L194521 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ How's the chicken?
L194432 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ And what are you like? A wino?
L194431 +++$+++ u871 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ VOICE-OVER +++$+++ Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...
L194382 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Any messages, Carmen?
L194381 +++$+++ u871 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ VOICE-OVER +++$+++ I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
L194380 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ So then she just stops calling.
L194337 +++$+++ u871 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ VOICE-OVER +++$+++ Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!
L194336 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!
L194322 +++$+++ u871 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ VOICE-OVER +++$+++ That's your look for me.
L194321 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Clementine.
L194320 +++$+++ u871 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ VOICE-OVER +++$+++ Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...
L194319 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...
L194318 +++$+++ u871 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ VOICE-OVER +++$+++ Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
L194317 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I should maybe talk to you.
L194315 +++$+++ u871 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ VOICE-OVER +++$+++ It's too late.
L194314 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ It's them.
L194310 +++$+++ u871 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ VOICE-OVER +++$+++ The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.
L194309 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Pink.  There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718?  I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.
L194308 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Fuck you, Clementine.
L194307 +++$+++ u871 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ VOICE-OVER +++$+++ Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
L194306 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I might be making a mistake.
L194304 +++$+++ u871 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ VOICE-OVER +++$+++ I'm like a joke to them.
L194303 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
L194302 +++$+++ u871 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ VOICE-OVER +++$+++ There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.
L194301 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ It was snowing.
L194569 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ Yes, but... I'm just something you're imagining. What can I do? I'm in your head, too.
L194568 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
L194567 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ What? What do you mean?
L194566 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ You have to stop this!
L194565 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
L194372 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way...
L194371 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
L194370 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Well... I did.
L194369 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
L194346 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.
L194345 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
L194344 +++$+++ u863 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MIERZWIAK +++$+++ We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
L195017 +++$+++ u864 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ NAOMI +++$+++ 'Night.
L195016 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ We'll speak soon.
L195015 +++$+++ u864 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ NAOMI +++$+++ So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
L195014 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I had a good time last night. I really did.
L195013 +++$+++ u864 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ NAOMI +++$+++ Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.
L194994 +++$+++ u864 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ NAOMI +++$+++ I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
L194993 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ So you think the dissertation will get published?
L194992 +++$+++ u864 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ NAOMI +++$+++ I'm glad you called.
L194991 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
L194990 +++$+++ u864 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ NAOMI +++$+++ A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
L194989 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Oh! Great. That's great!
L194988 +++$+++ u864 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ NAOMI +++$+++ Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
L194987 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I miss you.
L194986 +++$+++ u864 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ NAOMI +++$+++ Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
L194985 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
L194984 +++$+++ u864 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ NAOMI +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L194983 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
L194982 +++$+++ u864 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ NAOMI +++$+++ So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
L194845 +++$+++ u864 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ NAOMI +++$+++ Yeah.
L194844 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I hope you get your work done.
L194843 +++$+++ u864 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ NAOMI +++$+++ Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!
L194839 +++$+++ u864 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ NAOMI +++$+++ I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
L194838 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ So you don't mind?
L194836 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ In a minute.
L194835 +++$+++ u864 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ NAOMI +++$+++ Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.

L194833 +++$+++ u864 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ NAOMI +++$+++ Hi, Rob and Carrie.
L194832 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
L194831 +++$+++ u864 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ NAOMI +++$+++ How was it?
L194830 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Hi.
L194829 +++$+++ u864 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ NAOMI +++$+++ Hi.
L194798 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ It's not somebody else.
L194797 +++$+++ u864 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ NAOMI +++$+++ The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
L194796 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ No. I just need some space, maybe.
L194795 +++$+++ u864 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ NAOMI +++$+++ Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
L194794 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
L194793 +++$+++ u864 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ NAOMI +++$+++ Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
L194792 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
L194791 +++$+++ u864 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ NAOMI +++$+++ What?
L194790 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
L194789 +++$+++ u864 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ NAOMI +++$+++ So what's going on, Joel?
L194785 +++$+++ u864 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ NAOMI +++$+++ Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
L194784 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
L194783 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ You take it. I don't know.
L194782 +++$+++ u864 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ NAOMI +++$+++ Yours?
L194514 +++$+++ u862 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
L194513 +++$+++ u867 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Definitely!
