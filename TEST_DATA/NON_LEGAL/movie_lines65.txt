L63398 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ I feel a song a comin' on.
L63396 +++$+++ u451 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLEEP 'N EAT +++$+++ Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper.
L63395 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather.
L63394 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Years ago I married a widow who had a grown-up daughter.  My daddy visited us often, fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her. Thusly he became my son-in-law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father's wife. Soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son, which of course was my father's brother in-law and my uncle, for he was the brother of my step-mother.  My father's wife also became the mother of a son.  He was of course my brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter.  Accordingly, my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother's mother. 
L63393 +++$+++ u451 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLEEP 'N EAT +++$+++ Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
L63392 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ I don't know who I am.
L63391 +++$+++ u451 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLEEP 'N EAT +++$+++ How be dat?
L63390 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
L63389 +++$+++ u451 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLEEP 'N EAT +++$+++ Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
L63388 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
L63387 +++$+++ u451 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLEEP 'N EAT +++$+++ Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
L63386 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
L63385 +++$+++ u451 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLEEP 'N EAT +++$+++ You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
L63384 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ I slept too near where I fell out.
L63383 +++$+++ u451 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLEEP 'N EAT +++$+++ You slept too near where you got in?
L63382 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ I fell out of my bed last night.

L63204 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Y'know my lady Lucindy?
L63088 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Go to your windows and yell out, scream with all the life you can muster up inside your assaulted, bruised and battered bodies.  I'M SICK AND TIRED OF NIGGERS AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE!
L63087 +++$+++ u451 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLEEP 'N EAT +++$+++ You tellin' the truth.
L63086 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.
L63084 +++$+++ u451 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLEEP 'N EAT +++$+++ Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.
L63083 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
L63082 +++$+++ u451 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLEEP 'N EAT +++$+++ Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
L63081 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
L63080 +++$+++ u451 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLEEP 'N EAT +++$+++ Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
L63079 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ To come back to our roots.
L63078 +++$+++ u451 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLEEP 'N EAT +++$+++ ...the big apple, New York, New York.
L63077 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
L63075 +++$+++ u451 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLEEP 'N EAT +++$+++ And this is my very best friend Mantan.
L63074 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
L63533 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ I wuz leaving anyway, for good.
L63532 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ You can go now.
L63531 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ I know I won't be your puppet.
L63530 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Why don't you answer?
L63529 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Don't try to change to the subject.
L63528 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
L63527 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass.
L63526 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I.
L63525 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Aw, c'mon.
L63524 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.
L63523 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
L63522 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Say what, Manray?
L63521 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Oh, you gonna make me say it.
L63520 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Just ask me what you want to know.
L63519 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Stop playing me Sloan.
L63518 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ And what?
L63517 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ And?
L63516 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
L63515 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ You leave something out?
L63514 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
L63513 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ How did you get this gig?
L63441 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ You look beautiful like that.
L63440 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ What?
L63439 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Y'know what?
L63438 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.
L63436 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ My people love me.
L63435 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ You're sure this is a good idea.
L63434 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ For what?  He left.  Not me.
L63433 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Why don't you call him?
L63380 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ We can look out for ourselves.
L63379 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
L63378 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.
L63377 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Bert Williams and the rest, they had to black up.  They had no choice.  They were considered 3/5ths of a human being.  Did you know that's written in the Constitution of the United States?
L63376 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
L63375 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Maybe you need to start.
L63374 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Never read a book in my whole life.
L63373 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ You don't read, do you?
L63372 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ No, before my time.
L63371 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
L63370 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Gots no intention of ending up broke.
L63369 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
L63368 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Just a little something' somethin'.
L63367 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Oh you do, huh?
L63366 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
L63365 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny.
L63105 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Are you trying to rap to me?
L63104 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ What else?
L63103 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
L63102 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ The good stuff.
L63101 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ What do you want to know?
L63100 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ So what's up with you?
L62904 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Enough.
L62903 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ A lot?
L62883 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
L62882 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
L64606 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
L64605 +++$+++ u454 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ ARMED GENTLEMAN +++$+++ Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
L64604 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ That is none of your business.
L64603 +++$+++ u454 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ ARMED GENTLEMAN +++$+++ Where are you bound for?
L64602 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Good morning.
L64601 +++$+++ u454 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ ARMED GENTLEMAN +++$+++ Good day to you, young sir.
L64575 +++$+++ u463 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the pistols.  God bless you, my boy; and when I count three, fire.
L64574 +++$+++ u455 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN BEST +++$+++ Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
L64573 +++$+++ u463 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?
L64530 +++$+++ u463 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You know the use of arms very well, Best, and no one can doubt your courage; but Michael and I will see you home for all that.
L64529 +++$+++ u455 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN BEST +++$+++ I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
L64528 +++$+++ u463 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Both of us ride home with Best here.
L64524 +++$+++ u463 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.
L64523 +++$+++ u455 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN BEST +++$+++ And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --
L64501 +++$+++ u455 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN BEST +++$+++ I never was more in earnest.
L64500 +++$+++ u466 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
L64499 +++$+++ u455 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN BEST +++$+++ It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
L64498 +++$+++ u466 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
L64497 +++$+++ u455 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN BEST +++$+++ I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
L64496 +++$+++ u466 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?
L64828 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn.  You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival.  We must force that box.  You are a clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago.
L64827 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ And his baggage?
L64826 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
L64823 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
L64822 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ Has he sent the challenge yet?
L64808 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
L64807 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ What are the Chevalier's intentions?
L64769 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ I had thought you more expert.  You must find out if the Chevalier cheats.  He sees the English and Austrian envoys continually, and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house.  Find out what they talk of, for how much each plays, especially if any of them play on parole.  If you are able to, read his private letters, though about those which go to the post, you need not trouble yourself -- we look at them there.  But never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes, and by what channel or messenger.  He sleeps with the keys of his dispatch-box with a string around his neck -- twenty frederics, if you get an impression of the keys.
L64768 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Only a very little, as soldiers do.
L64767 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?
L64764 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.
L64763 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ What is the service, sir?
L64762 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
L64761 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.
L64760 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ How do you do, sir?
L64759 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
L64742 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Neither!
L64741 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
L64740 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Sir, I'm a British officer.
L64739 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ I have acted as I think fit.
L64738 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.
L64737 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
L64736 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Where's the beauty you promised me?
L64733 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ The people are great farmers, as well as inn-keepers.
L64732 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
L64731 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.
L64730 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe?
L64729 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
L64728 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?
L64726 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...
L64725 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ O'Grady.
L64724 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ What is your uncle's name?
L64723 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him.
L64692 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ He has paid off your uncle's mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach- and-six.  That coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family.  Faith, the business was well done.  Your cousins, Michael and Harry, never let him out of their sight, though he was for deserting to England, until the marriage was completed, and the happy couple off on their road to Dublin.  Are you in want of cash, my boy?  You may draw upon me, for I got a couple of hundred out of Master Best for my share and, while they last, you shall never want.
L64691 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ The coward!
L64690 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
L64689 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
L64688 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
L64687 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
L64686 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
L64685 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Is Miss Dugan well?
L64684 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.
L64683 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ We must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married to "Brown Bess."
L64682 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
L64681 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
L64680 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.
L64572 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.
L64571 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.
L64563 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ It must have been some other gate.
L64562 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
L64561 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
L64560 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I'll match any man with the sword.
L64559 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
L64558 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.
L64557 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
L64556 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
L64555 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
