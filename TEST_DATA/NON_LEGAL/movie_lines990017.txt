L292000 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ We'll never know for sure.
L291785 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Good night.
L291784 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ Well there's no time like the present.  Good night.
L291782 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ Perhaps I'll see you in church.
L291781 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Thank you.
L291780 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home.
L291779 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.
L291778 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.
L291768 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul.  She would hear things, see things...
L291767 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What was she afraid of?
L291745 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ How can I help you?
L291744 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ My name is Father Seamus.  I'm from Holy Rood church.
L291743 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ And you...are?
L291742 +++$+++ u5931 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ You must be the new tenants.
L291990 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ I don't know!  Trust what I'm saying, we have to open this wall!
L291989 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Well what is it!
L291988 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ There's something through that wall!
L291987 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What?
L291986 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ There's something in there.
L291946 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Not at all, if it can help.
L291945 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ Do you mind if I borrow it?
L291942 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Runic?
L291941 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
L291940 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ It was nailed to the cellar wall.
L291939 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ Where did you find this?
L291937 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Not really.  Oh, wait a minute.
L291936 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?
L291929 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ Not someone.  Something. I've never felt a presence that strong before.
L291928 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
L291927 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ Looks like we have some animal hairs in here.  Maybe some kind of a rodent.
L291901 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ Well, we could bring in special equipment, monitors, sound devices, things like that.
L291900 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ And what would you do?
L291899 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant.
L291897 +++$+++ u5933 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Oh.
L291896 +++$+++ u5932 +++$+++ m392 +++$+++ SHEA +++$+++ No.  But I'm a clairvoyant.  I can sometimes talk to unhappy spirits inhabiting a certain place.
L292308 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ No.  Not on station time.  My story.  My time.
L292307 +++$+++ u5934 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Not on station time.
L292303 +++$+++ u5934 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ And I believe what you say.  But this is TV.  No pictures, no story.
L292302 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I know what I saw.
L292301 +++$+++ u5934 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Right.  Like last night's doozie.
L292300 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way.  Not tight skirts.  Tight stories.
L292299 +++$+++ u5934 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ C'mon, Joey.  I'm just trying to help you hit a home run here.
L292296 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Jesus Christ ...
L292295 +++$+++ u5934 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ What, you think I'm kidding?  I guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys upstairs get hot.  Bingo, you're an anchor-woman.
L292293 +++$+++ u5934 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ I mean hardly any thigh.  I'm telling you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you're made.
L292292 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ What do you mean?
L292643 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Doc?  ...  Doc ... Hello?
L292642 +++$+++ u5935 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
L292641 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Hello?
L292270 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ That is the story of my life.
L292269 +++$+++ u5935 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.
L292268 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.
L292267 +++$+++ u5935 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
L292266 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.
L292261 +++$+++ u5935 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ Yeah, well like you said - it's a mystery.  But that's all it is. Mystery.  Not malice.  What, you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ?
L292260 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I know.  I know.  But it's just so ... neat, isn't it?  The first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me.
L292639 +++$+++ u5936 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ ELLIOTT +++$+++ The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
L292638 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Wha .... ?
L292637 +++$+++ u5936 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ ELLIOTT +++$+++ Your apartment.
L292636 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ So where is it?
L292635 +++$+++ u5936 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ ELLIOTT +++$+++ This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
L292634 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Then tell me what to do.
L292633 +++$+++ u5936 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ ELLIOTT +++$+++ Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another.  You're stronger than you think.
L292632 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I don't know ...
L292631 +++$+++ u5936 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ ELLIOTT +++$+++ I like you, Joey.  You ask all the right questions.  There is something we can do but it will require great courage.
L292630 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ What can we do?
L292629 +++$+++ u5936 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ ELLIOTT +++$+++ He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
L292628 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ What will he do?  What does he want?
L292627 +++$+++ u5936 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ ELLIOTT +++$+++ Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box had to be opened to let me out.  The truly innocent were safe.  That's no longer true.  The shell of the beast has been fleshed.  What I was is out there, Joey.  In your world.  Unbound. Unstoppable.
L292626 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Kirsty Cotton.  Yes.  But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back?
L292624 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ And why are you back?  Why are we here?
L292623 +++$+++ u5936 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ ELLIOTT +++$+++ Something bad.
L292622 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ And what did you discover?
L292621 +++$+++ u5936 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ ELLIOTT +++$+++ The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
L292620 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ And what is ... this frozen moment?
L292619 +++$+++ u5936 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ ELLIOTT +++$+++ The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.
L292617 +++$+++ u5936 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ ELLIOTT +++$+++ Hell is precisely what is going on, Joey.  And we have to stop it.  I because of a special obligation, you because you're the only person who can help. And because you know what is right, and just, and true.  Will you walk with me a while?
L292616 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
L292615 +++$+++ u5936 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ ELLIOTT +++$+++ Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?
L292613 +++$+++ u5936 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ ELLIOTT +++$+++ Correct.  The fields of France.  And many dead flowers ... Oh.  Forgive me. My name was Spenser.  Elliott Spenser. Captain.
L292612 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right?
L292611 +++$+++ u5936 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ ELLIOTT +++$+++ You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no, you're not dreaming.  Do you know where we are?
L292610 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming this?
L292448 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Help me pick 'em up, Terri.  I think the lady just made a sale.
L292447 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Joey ... ?
L292444 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
L292443 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ What am I looking for?
L292420 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Here!  Here!  Pull over!
L292419 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
L292418 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.
L292417 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Oh, Terri ...
L292416 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Buying some drugs, alright?
L292415 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Terri?
L292414 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ What on earth were you doing down here?
L292413 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
L292412 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?
L292411 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
L292410 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Sure.  Why?
L292409 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Would you know this store again?
L292408 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
L292407 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ That you found.  What do you mean you found it?
L292406 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
L292405 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
L292404 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
L292403 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
L292402 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ But I don't know what's going on.
L292398 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ No.  He knows it won't.  It was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him doesn't yet.
L292397 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
L292396 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Every day.
L292395 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ And he still sits there?
L292394 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
L292393 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Who's that?
L292392 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ ... but it is good.  You know, over to the left, you can ...
L292389 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I don't think so.  But it's a fascinating subject.  Did you ...
L292388 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like all these people discovering who they used to be.  You know, like reincarnation?  It was really good.  You ever read that?
L292387 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
L292386 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
L292385 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
L292384 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ How have you ... ?
L292383 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Jeez, I've never owned anything.  I haven't even had a room of my own since I was fifteen years old.
L292382 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
L292381 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?
L292380 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ No!  No, that's OK.  I like to.  I love boiling water.  It's a specialty of mine.  Why don't you go watch cartoons?
L292379 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ I'll do it!
L292378 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I'll boil some water.
L292377 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Ha!  I don't know yet.  First time. Kitchen virgin, that's me.
L292376 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always this ... exploratory?
L292375 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ I figured I'd make breakfast.
L292364 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ That's what I'm trying to tell you! ...
L292363 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
L292362 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
L292361 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
L292360 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
L292359 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Taken what?
L292358 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue.
L292357 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Did you know him?
L292356 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ...
L292355 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
L292354 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.
L292352 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
L292351 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.
L292350 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You think you're going to live forever?
L292349 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I'm trying to quit.
L292348 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
L292344 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I know what you're saying but ... Never? You've never had a dream?  No, you know, you do.  You must.  What you mean is you don't remember them.
L292343 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
L292342 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ What?
L292341 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ That's great.
L292340 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out.
L292339 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?
L292338 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.
L292337 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Sorry.
L292336 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Why are you so interested?
L292335 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ What is it?
L292334 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ ... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is.
L292333 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Oh yeah ...
L292332 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
L292331 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ What?

L292441 +++$+++ u5939 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ MAMA +++$+++ Right at the back there.  Middle shelves.  Coupla folders.  Nice stuff. I'd do you a good price.
L292440 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I don't know.  Maybe.

L292436 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ What else came with it?  Anything still here?
L292435 +++$+++ u5939 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ MAMA +++$+++ It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
L292434 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
L292433 +++$+++ u5939 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ MAMA +++$+++ Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
L292428 +++$+++ u5939 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ MAMA +++$+++ I took back everything bought on a whim, I'd have no business.  I ...
L292427 +++$+++ u5937 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ No.  We want ...

L292491 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
L292490 +++$+++ u5941 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ You shit.  Who do you think you are?
L292489 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
L292488 +++$+++ u5941 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ But you gave me a rose ...
