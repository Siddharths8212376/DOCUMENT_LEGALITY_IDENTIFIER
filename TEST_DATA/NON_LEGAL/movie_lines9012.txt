L117911 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
L117910 +++$+++ u654 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ PROFESSOR CARTER +++$+++ Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.
L117834 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Hey, I got no choice.
L117833 +++$+++ u654 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ PROFESSOR CARTER +++$+++ Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
L117832 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
L117884 +++$+++ u647 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ HEIDI +++$+++ Maybe because they never do.  So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?
L117883 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ It didn't feel like a dream.
L117875 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.
L117874 +++$+++ u647 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ HEIDI +++$+++ Come on, go on...
L117871 +++$+++ u647 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ HEIDI +++$+++ Deal. Now read me something.
L117870 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
L117867 +++$+++ u647 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ HEIDI +++$+++ Wow... read something.
L117866 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
L117865 +++$+++ u647 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ HEIDI +++$+++ Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
L117863 +++$+++ u647 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ HEIDI +++$+++ You're kidding. He's so... big.
L117862 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Thumper had a busy afternoon.
L117861 +++$+++ u647 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ HEIDI +++$+++ Smells like sex in here.
L117857 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.
L117856 +++$+++ u647 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ HEIDI +++$+++ So what's the point?
L118312 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh.
L118311 +++$+++ u651 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Destroy it?
L118310 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
L118309 +++$+++ u651 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ What?
L118308 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
L118307 +++$+++ u651 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
L118305 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
L118304 +++$+++ u651 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Are you sure you even packed it?
L118262 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
L118261 +++$+++ u651 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Uh, we should be getting to class now.
L118174 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Y... yes. I guess I did.
L118173 +++$+++ u651 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ You knew the whole time, didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!
L117891 +++$+++ u651 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
L117890 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
L117889 +++$+++ u651 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I couldn't cut the rope.
L117736 +++$+++ u651 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Gee, thanks friend.
L117735 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ That should buy you ten minutes at least.
L117650 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
L117649 +++$+++ u651 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Can... can... Can I have this?
L118296 +++$+++ u656 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ I think I'll go check out the chapel.
L118295 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
L118288 +++$+++ u656 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
L118287 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Lung cancer?
L118260 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.
L118259 +++$+++ u656 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance.
L118153 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
L118152 +++$+++ u656 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Listen to me good, Evan...
L118089 +++$+++ u656 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
L118088 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
L118087 +++$+++ u656 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
L118086 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ What the hell are you doing?
L118083 +++$+++ u656 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself.
L118082 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Leave us alone you sick fuck!
L117823 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ What's wrong with you?!
L117822 +++$+++ u656 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Look what you made me do!
L117741 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ What happened?? Where are we?!
L117740 +++$+++ u656 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
L117720 +++$+++ u656 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.
L117719 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
L117647 +++$+++ u656 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
L117646 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Hey, what'd you do that for?
L118191 +++$+++ u657 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ Sorry. Never heard of her.
L118190 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
L118189 +++$+++ u657 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ Meant no offense.
L118188 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ I come from a big family.
L118187 +++$+++ u657 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
L118186 +++$+++ u646 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Huh?
L118185 +++$+++ u657 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ Just get out, didja?
L118085 +++$+++ u656 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
L118084 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Shut up, Tommy!
L117906 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Oh my God oh my God...
L117905 +++$+++ u656 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Lenny? Come on!
L117775 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L117774 +++$+++ u656 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?
L117729 +++$+++ u656 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Just blow something up? Are you nuts? There's an art to mass destruction. Would you just paint the Mona Lisa? No. Besides, we're here already.
L117728 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
L117727 +++$+++ u656 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
L117685 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
L117684 +++$+++ u656 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ I thought I was the bad guy!
L117683 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
L117682 +++$+++ u656 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
L117681 +++$+++ u650 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ KAYLEIGH +++$+++ Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
L117900 +++$+++ u656 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
L117899 +++$+++ u651 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
L117733 +++$+++ u651 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
L117732 +++$+++ u656 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
L117731 +++$+++ u651 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
L117730 +++$+++ u656 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Here you go, buddy.
L117643 +++$+++ u656 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ You're such a retard!
L117642 +++$+++ u651 +++$+++ m41 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
L119167 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ -- He's just a lucky guy.
L119166 +++$+++ u658 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ANNINA +++$+++ Monsieur Rick, I --
L119142 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems. Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
L119141 +++$+++ u658 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ANNINA +++$+++ Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
L119140 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Go back to Bulgaria.
L119139 +++$+++ u658 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ANNINA +++$+++ Oh, yes, please.
L119138 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ You want my advice?
L119137 +++$+++ u658 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ANNINA +++$+++ And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
L119136 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Nobody ever loved me that much.
L119134 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ He always has.
L119133 +++$+++ u658 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ANNINA +++$+++ -- Will he keep his word?
L119132 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ And you want to know --
L119131 +++$+++ u658 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ANNINA +++$+++ Yes, Monsieur.
L119130 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ And he is still willing to give you a visa?
L119129 +++$+++ u658 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ANNINA +++$+++ Oh, yes.
L119128 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Does he know that?
L119127 +++$+++ u658 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ANNINA +++$+++ He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
L119126 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Yes, I'll bet.
L119125 +++$+++ u658 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ANNINA +++$+++ Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
L119124 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ So you decided to go to America.
L119123 +++$+++ u658 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ANNINA +++$+++ Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
L119122 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ How long have you been married?
L119121 +++$+++ u658 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ANNINA +++$+++ At the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visa. Well of course, he's losing.
L119120 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I thought so. Where's your husband?
L119119 +++$+++ u658 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ANNINA +++$+++ He did. Captain Renault did.
L119118 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ -- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
L119117 +++$+++ u658 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ANNINA +++$+++ No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
L119116 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
L119115 +++$+++ u658 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ANNINA +++$+++ Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
L119114 +++$+++ u658 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ANNINA +++$+++ No.
L119113 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
L119112 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?
L119111 +++$+++ u658 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ANNINA +++$+++ My husband is with me, too.
L119110 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I should have known.
L119109 +++$+++ u658 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ANNINA +++$+++ I came with Captain Renault.
L119108 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ How did you get in here? You're under age.
L119107 +++$+++ u658 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ANNINA +++$+++ Could I speak to you for just a moment, please?
L119106 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Yes?
L119105 +++$+++ u658 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ANNINA +++$+++ Monsieur Rick?
L118725 +++$+++ u659 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ BERGER +++$+++ But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would come...
L118724 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ I see.
L118722 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.
L118721 +++$+++ u659 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ BERGER +++$+++ We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
L118720 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
L118719 +++$+++ u659 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ BERGER +++$+++ I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.
L118718 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ A champagne cocktail, please.
L118717 +++$+++ u659 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ BERGER +++$+++ Yes, Monsieur.
L118716 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
L118674 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ I'm sorry. It is.
L118673 +++$+++ u659 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ BERGER +++$+++ Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
L118670 +++$+++ u659 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ BERGER +++$+++ Berger, Norwegian, and at your service, sir.
L118669 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ What is your name?
L118668 +++$+++ u659 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ BERGER +++$+++ Good.
L118666 +++$+++ u659 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ BERGER +++$+++ -- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
L118665 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Thank you, but I hardly think --
L118664 +++$+++ u659 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ BERGER +++$+++ You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
L118663 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Well?
L118662 +++$+++ u659 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ BERGER +++$+++ Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.
L119329 +++$+++ u660 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L119328 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I want you to take Miss Lund home.
L119327 +++$+++ u660 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Yes, I come, I will do it.
L119326 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ -- Tonight he forgot.
L119325 +++$+++ u660 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ But Sacha always puts out that light --
L119324 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
L119323 +++$+++ u660 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Yes, I come.
L119322 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Come up here a minute.
L119321 +++$+++ u660 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
L119269 +++$+++ u660 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
L119268 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Goodnight.
L119267 +++$+++ u660 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ I won't.
L119266 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ -- Don't tell me where you're going.
L119265 +++$+++ u660 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
L119264 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?
L119263 +++$+++ u660 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Oh, thank you, Herr Rick. Sacha will be happy to hear it. I owe him money.
L119262 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
L119261 +++$+++ u660 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
L119260 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ How long can I afford to stay closed?
L119259 +++$+++ u660 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
L119170 +++$+++ u660 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Monsieur Rick!
L119169 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ No thanks, Carl.
L119168 +++$+++ u660 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?
L118537 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ That's all right.
L118536 +++$+++ u661 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
L118535 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Here you are.
L118523 +++$+++ u661 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ I'm awfully sorry.
L118522 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ -- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
L118521 +++$+++ u661 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
L118520 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Well, I'll get it from the safe.
L118519 +++$+++ u661 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.
L119051 +++$+++ u662 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ EUROPEAN +++$+++ It has been a pleasure to meet you.
L119050 +++$+++ u670 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ TOURIST +++$+++ Er, goodbye, sir.
L119048 +++$+++ u662 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ EUROPEAN +++$+++ I have to warn you, sir. I beseech you...
L119047 +++$+++ u670 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ TOURIST +++$+++ Er, my check, please.
L119046 +++$+++ u662 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ EUROPEAN +++$+++ I'd better be going.
L119045 +++$+++ u670 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ TOURIST +++$+++ Er, good luck, yes.
L119044 +++$+++ u662 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ EUROPEAN +++$+++ Here's to you, sir.
L119387 +++$+++ u663 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ FERRARI +++$+++ I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
L119386 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.

L119384 +++$+++ u663 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ FERRARI +++$+++ Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
L119383 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
L119382 +++$+++ u663 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ FERRARI +++$+++ Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
L119381 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.

L118982 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
L118981 +++$+++ u663 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ FERRARI +++$+++ Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
