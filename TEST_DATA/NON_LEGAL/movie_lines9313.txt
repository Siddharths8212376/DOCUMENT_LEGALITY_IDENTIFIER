L426521 +++$+++ u2400 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PENNY +++$+++ I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.
L426520 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ You said it was in the rolltop desk!

L426515 +++$+++ u2400 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PENNY +++$+++ That's not my ring.
L426514 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ And you were right about that ring. Any other weddin' band would not do. But this-here was foreordained, honey; fate was a-smilin' on me, and ya have to have confidence -
L426513 +++$+++ u2400 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PENNY +++$+++ That's good, honey.
L426512 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ ...Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.

L426459 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
L426458 +++$+++ u2400 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PENNY +++$+++ We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
L426457 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
L426456 +++$+++ u2400 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PENNY +++$+++ I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
L426455 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Where's your ring, honey?
L426454 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
L426453 +++$+++ u2400 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PENNY +++$+++ McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
L426262 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ ...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!
L426261 +++$+++ u2400 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PENNY +++$+++ I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
L426260 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
L426259 +++$+++ u2400 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PENNY +++$+++ No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
L426258 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Now Penny, stop that!
L426257 +++$+++ u2400 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PENNY +++$+++ That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train.
L426504 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...
L426503 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
L426502 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
L426501 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ We prayed to God and he pitied us!
L426405 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ No, this is gonna work! I just gotta get close enough to talk to her. Takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named Waldrip.  I'm goddamn bona fide. I've got the answers!
L426404 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ This is crazy. No one's ever gonna believe we're a real band.
L426394 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Wait a minute - who elected you leader a this outfit? Since we been followin' your lead we got nothin' but trouble! I gotten this close to bein' strung up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -
L426393 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Well, it's a invitation-only affair; we'll have to sneak in through the service entrance-
L426351 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
L426350 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Pete... I do apologize.
L426344 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ ...With my added time for the escape, I don't get out now 'til 1987... I'll be eighty-four years old.
L426343 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
L426342 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ ...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence...
L426341 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife wrote me she was gettin' married! I gotta stop it!
L426340 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ But...
L426337 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ But... but...
L426336 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Fact of the matter - there never was!
L426334 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Well, but Pete...
L426333 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
L426332 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...
L426329 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Aw, that's all right.
L426328 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ It's awful white of ya to take it like that, Everett. I feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' at my guts.
L426320 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.
L426319 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty.
L426318 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
L426317 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ It was a moment a weakness!
L426029 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ ...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken - see, we've been away for several years, uh...
L426028 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ ...Nah, that ain't right... I'm thinkin' of...
L426026 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Isn't it, uh...
L426025 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
L426019 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope.
L426018 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!
L426007 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Well that hardly sounds like you...
L426006 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still don't, really.
L426003 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ What about you, Delmar? What're you gonna do with your share a that dough?
L426002 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ An' all my meals for free...
L425996 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Million point two.
L425995 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ A million dollars.
L425943 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
L425942 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
L425938 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.
L425937 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ The preacher said it absolved us.
L425930 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Pete, don't be ignorant-
L425929 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Well, I'll be a sonofabitch. Delmar's been saved!
L425917 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Pete, it's a fool looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart. What the hell's that singing?
L425916 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ That don't make no sense!
L425915 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ So I borrowed it till I did know!
L425914 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ You didn't know that at the time!
L425913 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Who was fixing to betray us!
L425909 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ It was in his bureau.
L425908 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.
L425907 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
L425906 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
L425901 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ We got but four days to get to that treasure! After that, it'll be at the bottom of a lake!
L425900 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Don't I know it.
L425899 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!
L425876 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak with one voice here - CAREFUL WITH THAT FIRE NOW, BOYS!
L425875 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ YOU LOUSY YELLA-BELLIED LOW-DOWN SKUNKS-
L425863 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ The hell you say! Wash is kin!
L425862 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty!
L425810 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
L425809 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
L425808 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
L425807 +++$+++ u2401 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?
L425894 +++$+++ u2394 +++$+++ m153 +++$+++ EVERETT +++$+++ Well, ain't this place a geographical oddity-two weeks from everywhere! Forget it! Just the dozen hairnets!
