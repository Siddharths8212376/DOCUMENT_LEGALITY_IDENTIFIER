Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me?  That's not love, Jerry.  It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way.  Can you?
L142206 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ It's Geronimo.  Love. It lets you see things.  It gives you insight. I've loved you since the first time I saw you.

L142195 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
L142194 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.

L142190 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I don't know what to say.  I love you.

L142171 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
L142170 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.

L142168 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
L142167 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Elaborate on 'they,' okay?
L142166 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Henry Finch.  That they monitor everything.  That it was only a matter of time.  And now four people are dead.

L142094 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You run with your back to the picture.  Like you were trying to get away.  Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.

L142082 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ So what's the question?
L142081 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
L142080 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
L142079 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ It was that painting.  The one on the wall.

L142077 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
L142076 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You gave me an hour; now give me a day.
L142071 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Just a guy trying to put out a fire.

L142054 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I've never read it.  I just -- Every time I see one I buy it.  I don't know why exactly... Wanna hear my favorite part?

L142045 +++$+++ u4592 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Pretty scary, huh?
