L433515 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ His idea?  Gimme a break.  Fuckin' guy's got a vacant lot for a head.  Was you and me figured the whole thing out.
L433514 +++$+++ u6975 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
L433513 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.
L433509 +++$+++ u6975 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car.
L433508 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat.  Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.
L433489 +++$+++ u6975 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ The green-and-whites saw us.  One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there?  Ties it to the break and turns around...
L433488 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Do we need him?
L433480 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd like to know who she is.
L433479 +++$+++ u6975 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?
L433478 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ She's coming with us.
L433477 +++$+++ u6975 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?
L433474 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Okay, honey, come on out of there.
L433473 +++$+++ u6975 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
L433472 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Where in the hell are we?
L433393 +++$+++ u6975 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Why don't we talk about it later?
L433392 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I bet that's all the hacks they send out.  Otherwise nobody's left to mind the store.
L433351 +++$+++ u6975 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ The Wall Street guy?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't recognize him without his rug.
L433350 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ It's Richard Ripley.
L433926 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ And you let them come up.  You don't try to make the bust yourself.  You understand?
L433925 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Call and tell you.
L433924 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do?
L433923 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ You can go wait out in the car, you want to.
L433922 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
L433921 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby, watch the elevator.
L433916 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ The manager's door is metal.
L433915 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ Yeah, why?
L433914 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You're gonna use a ram?
L433913 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man.
L433911 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ They're in 7D.
L433910 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ You get the key?
L433901 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ Good.  Now forget about the ex-wife and get over to the Adams Hotel.
L433900 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ That's all I wanted to know.
L433899 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
L433898 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
L433897 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ What?  Is that what you're calling me about?
L433896 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?
L433895 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ Now.  What is it you wanted to tell me?
L433894 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Sure, Daniel.
L433893 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
L433892 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ All right, but...
L433891 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away...
L433890 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
L433889 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
L433888 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I'm at Adele Delisi's.
L433887 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
L433886 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Daniel.  Listen --
L433885 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you.
L433884 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Shut up.
L433665 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ Sounds to me like he liked having you around.  I'll see you, Karen.  Mr. Sisco.
L433664 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You'll have to ask him.
L433663 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ We'll talk another time, Karen.  All right?  I'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you any more.
L433662 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You have to know what you're talking about.
L433661 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ I have to qualify, is that it?
L433660 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?
L433659 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
L433658 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
L433657 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
L433656 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Is that what you would've done?
L433655 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ The time came, you shot him.  But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand.  You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down.  But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?
L433654 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ And what happened to Carl?
L433653 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.
L433652 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
L433651 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?
L433650 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ It was an unusual experience.
L433649 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
L433648 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Oh... different things, prison, movies.
L433647 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ What'd you talk about?
L433646 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ In the trunk, yeah?
L433645 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ You talked to him?
L433644 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
L433643 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.
L433636 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Coming to the Okeechobee exit...
L433635 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this?
L433634 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
L433633 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
L433632 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
L433628 +++$+++ u6976 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ BURDON +++$+++ Daniel Burdon, FBI.
L433627 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Hello, Daniel.
L433879 +++$+++ u6977 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ CHINO +++$+++ Excuse me, Adele?
L433878 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.
L433873 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You don't, huh?
L433872 +++$+++ u6977 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ CHINO +++$+++ Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
L433871 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You can live or die, it's up to you.
L433870 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ If you move, if you look at her again, you're dead.
L433869 +++$+++ u6977 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ CHINO +++$+++ I could walk out of here.
L433868 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What do you want to bet?
L433867 +++$+++ u6977 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ CHINO +++$+++ You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
L433866 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Put it down or I'll shoot.
L433865 +++$+++ u6977 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ CHINO +++$+++ Oh.  Then this must be Adele...
L433864 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.
L433863 +++$+++ u6977 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ CHINO +++$+++ Wait.  You not Adele?
L433862 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Leave it where it is.
L433293 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I appreciate the offer.  And it's tempting.
L433292 +++$+++ u6977 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ CHINO +++$+++ You see what they doing, those posts out there?  Putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the one that's there.  We wait until Super Bowl Sunday, they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days.  So we going soon as it's dark.  You want -- I mean it -- you can still come.
L433290 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out.
L433289 +++$+++ u6977 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ CHINO +++$+++ You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley.  I like you.
L433288 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ You were out running this morning, sticking to your routine, anybody happened to notice.  But you only did a couple of miles instead of your usual five.  Saving yourself for the main event.  Then I see you inside eating ten pounds of macaroni. Carbohydrates for endurance.
L433287 +++$+++ u6977 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ CHINO +++$+++ Why you think is today?
L433286 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
L433285 +++$+++ u6977 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ CHINO +++$+++ I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
L433284 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ You excited?
L434578 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Wait, I know him --okay?
L434577 +++$+++ u6979 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ Karen, I told you not to--
L434561 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Oh-kay...
L434560 +++$+++ u6979 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
L434559 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Hello?
L434098 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
L434097 +++$+++ u6979 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
L434096 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I'll need a last known address.
L434095 +++$+++ u6979 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.
L434094 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
L434093 +++$+++ u6979 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ Who was the friend?
L434092 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.
L434091 +++$+++ u6979 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
L434090 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
L434089 +++$+++ u6979 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
L434088 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ No, I didn't know that.
L434087 +++$+++ u6979 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
L434086 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
L434085 +++$+++ u6979 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together.  You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?
L434083 +++$+++ u6979 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals.
L434082 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
L434081 +++$+++ u6979 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
L434080 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What is it with crack and transsexuals?
L434079 +++$+++ u6979 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
L434078 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Who?
L434077 +++$+++ u6979 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
L434076 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Quite a mess.
L434075 +++$+++ u6979 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ Freezing.  But I'm getting warmer.
L434074 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ How are you, Raymond?
L434073 +++$+++ u6979 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ Ironic, isn't it?
L434558 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ You're right.  So why take a chance--
L434557 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
L434556 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ A little.
L434555 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Nervous?
L434554 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Not until recently.
L434553 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?
L434516 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Someone down here?
L434515 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Good luck, Richard.
L434420 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I've seen 'em used on TV.
L434419 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ You know how to use one a these?
L434418 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Hey.  You learn from doing.
L434417 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
L434416 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor.
L434414 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Shit, yeah.  White Boy even got busted for it.  White Boy, tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary that time.
L434413 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ So you've done this before, huh?
L434412 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it.
L434411 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ That what they're wearing these days to break and enter?
L434400 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I wasn't asking permission.
L434399 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind.
L434398 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
L434397 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it.
L434395 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I thought everything.
L434394 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know?
L434393 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn is...
L434392 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ The fuck you talking about?
L434391 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ We're leaving.
L434390 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push him off.
L434385 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Your homie, Glenn.  Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back.
L434384 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Who's sitting here?
L434065 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any business in here.  To me this is holy ground, man.  You understand?  I got to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.
L434064 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
L434063 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Let's go outside and talk.
L434062 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you.
L434059 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Glenn didn't tell you?
L434058 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
