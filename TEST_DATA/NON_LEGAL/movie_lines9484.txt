L630513 +++$+++ u3378 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ Anything else?
L630512 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Agent Chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. He had me drive the van with the body back here. Which we did. It was 105 miles.
L631251 +++$+++ u3393 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE +++$+++ You are here and there is no place to go...
L631250 +++$+++ u3378 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ Where am I? And how can I leave?
L631249 +++$+++ u3393 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE +++$+++ The later events have never been kept a secret.
L631248 +++$+++ u3378 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ That would indicate that it's the future.
L631247 +++$+++ u3393 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE +++$+++ Someone else has it now.
L631246 +++$+++ u3378 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ Where is the ring?
L630392 +++$+++ u3384 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No.  Ask Irene over there.
L630391 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Did she ever mention any friends?
L630390 +++$+++ u3384 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No.
L630389 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Ever see her with someone else?
L630388 +++$+++ u3384 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No.
L630387 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Any friends?
L630386 +++$+++ u3384 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
L630385 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
L630384 +++$+++ u3384 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ He didn't suffer.
L630383 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Sorry to hear it.
L630382 +++$+++ u3384 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ He's dead -- good and dead.
L630381 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Where's Hap?
L630380 +++$+++ u3384 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Had the FBI here once before. Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place.
L630426 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Thanks.
L630425 +++$+++ u3383 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking.  I just thought I ought to tell you.
L630424 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ What do you mean?
L630423 +++$+++ u3383 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ You know, I never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, Teresa's arm went completely dead.
L630411 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Thanks.
L630410 +++$+++ u3383 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
L630409 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ He's with me.  Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?
L630406 +++$+++ u3383 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ No, I do not. I never took cocaine or any other drugs. I don't take drugs.
L630405 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Do you take cocaine, Irene?
L630404 +++$+++ u3383 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ No.
L630403 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
L630402 +++$+++ u3383 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
L630401 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ What happened to her?
L630400 +++$+++ u3383 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.
L630399 +++$+++ u3383 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ She only worked here a month. Nice girl. Never seemed to get here on time though. Ask me she had a little problem with --
L630398 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks. Jack said you knew her. How well?
L630397 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Say no more.
L630396 +++$+++ u3383 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
L630395 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ How come Jack let's you work here?
L630394 +++$+++ u3383 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ Take a good look around. There's nobody in this place -- you're meetin' the reason why. What'll it be?
L630501 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ We do notice things, don't we, Agent Desmond? Are you going back to the trailer park for the Blue rose?
L630500 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
L630499 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
L630498 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Faulty wiring.
L630497 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
L630490 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ I don't take it, Sam. I give it.
L630489 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ When he says, "Discussion", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?
L630480 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Yes, he is like a clown.
L630479 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
L630478 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
L630457 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond?  There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.
L630456 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.
L630455 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ She's wearing a ring.
L630454 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Take a look at this.
L630452 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ I'll get my kit.
L630451 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ You better dust this place, Sam.
L630450 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ She must have known someone.
L630449 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ She lived alone.
L630432 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
L630431 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
L630430 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Are you speaking to me in a code?
L630429 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ I think we should see the sun rise at the Canyon Trailer Park.
L630428 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ I think that's a good idea.
L630427 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.
L630422 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ It's not late, it's early. Really early.
L630421 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ It's late, Sam.
L630420 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Agent Desmond, it's...
L630378 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Yes, it's been several hours since we've eaten. I didn't realize that so much time had past, did you, Agent Desmond?
L630377 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
L630376 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep?
L630375 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ It is a piece of paper with the letter "T" imprinted on it. Take a look.
L630374 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ What is it?
L630373 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.
L630372 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Accidental?
L630370 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Oh.
L630369 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ There appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand.
L630366 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Cole said she was 17.
L630365 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Crushed skull. Probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. Subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.
L630364 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Sure, but let's finish up with this first.
L630363 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Maybe, later we could take a look.
L630362 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ I don't know, Sam.
L630361 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Yes, it is good.  What do you think is in these other drawers?
L630360 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ That's good.
L630359 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
L630358 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ That's what I heard.
L630357 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
L630334 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ It must be a high priority situation.
L630333 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
L630332 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ I see. He does talk loud.
L630331 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ He talks loud. And he loves his code.
L630330 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
L630329 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
L630328 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ What did Gordon's tie mean?
L630327 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
L630326 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ A blue rose.
L630325 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
L630324 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
L630323 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
L630322 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
L630321 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
L630320 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Oh, the uncle is missing.
L630314 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Her face had a sour look... that means we're going to have trouble with the local authorities. They are not going to be receptive to the FBI.
L630313 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ What do you mean?
L630312 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Lil was wearing a sour face.
L630311 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ I'll explain it to you. Do you remember Lil's dance?
L630310 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ How do you figure?
L630309 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ We're heading into a difficult situation.
L630308 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Shorthand. Really?
L630307 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Sort of shorthand.
L630306 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Code, I've heard a lot about this.
L630305 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
L630304 +++$+++ u3398 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ That was really something.  That dancing girl.  What did it mean?
L630984 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Cause I like it.
L630983 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Why do you do it, Laura?
L630982 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
L630981 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ But I love you, Laura.
L630980 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
L630979 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
L630978 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I can't help you there.
L630977 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
L630976 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ WE got it back, that's all.
L630975 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ How did the car get back here?
L630974 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ What can I tell you?
L630973 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.
L630972 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ No.
L630971 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ You're not mad at me?
L630970 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
L630969 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Laura, I am your friend.
L630968 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ No, you should forget about last night.
L630967 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should remember?
L630950 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Not you, Donna, not you.
L630949 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ I won't wear your stuff.  I promise.
L630948 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Jacques, help me get her home. NOW!
L630947 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
L630946 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.
L630910 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
L630909 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.
L630907 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Nothing.
L630906 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ What are you doing?
L630890 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Gotta go, Donna. I'll call you tomorrow.
L630889 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ If I had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I'd be dead.
L630888 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Dancing.
L630887 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You mean Fred and Ginger?
L630886 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Where are the Cookies?
L630885 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
L630884 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
L630883 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Come on, Laura. I'm your best friend.
L630882 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
L630881 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Where are you going?
L630807 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ No, you're the muffin.
L630806 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Goodbye, Muffin.
L630789 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Donna, you are a muffin.
L630788 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ You want a muffin?
L630787 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ If I can smoke it.
L630786 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
L630785 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
L630784 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
L630783 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ No, I want to smoke.
L630782 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Do you want to talk?
L630781 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You know, even when I think about your face I get happier.
L630780 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
L630779 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
L630778 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
L630777 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
L630776 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ What is it Laura? What's wrong?
L630775 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Of course...
L630774 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Donna, are you my best friend?
L630773 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Laura?
L630672 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.
L630671 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Sure. What do you want me to call you?
L630670 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Call me.
L630669 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Okay, I suppose I should go home.
L630668 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Maybe I better start our homework.
L630667 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever.
L630666 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
L630664 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ James is very sweet and very gorgeous.
L630663 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
L630662 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Yes, James is very sweet. Why don't you get out your violin, Donna?
L630661 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Because Bobby is a loser, you said so yourself. He's a goon.  James is the one.  He loves you with that "lasting love"... "true love".
L630660 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Well, why not?
L630659 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Oh god, Laura.
L630658 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Maybe.
L630657 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
L630656 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
L630655 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Are you going to see James tonight?
L630628 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
L630627 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.
L630626 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
L630625 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
L630624 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I don't know what to do.
L630623 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
L630622 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
L630621 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
L630620 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ He probably wanted to drive over.
L630619 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ The usual, 9:15.
L630618 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ When?
L630617 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ James called me last night looking for you.
L630616 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Thanks.
L630615 +++$+++ u3380 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
