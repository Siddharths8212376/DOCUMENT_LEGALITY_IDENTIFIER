L44858 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
L44857 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Skywire.
L44856 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
L44855 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Low enough to relay internet traffic.
L44854 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room.  It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up.
L44851 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
L44850 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You know a lot about art, I guess.
L44847 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Oh. No thanks.
L44846 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Would you like a Coke or something?
L44845 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Cool!
L44808 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You would? Wow. When would we come?  'Think he hung up.
L44807 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
L44806 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ ...Hello?
L45546 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Just do it.
L45545 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Gary?
L45544 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ 'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.
L45543 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ What?
L45542 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Wait... He knows.
L45541 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Longitude 109 --
L45540 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Let's go.
L45539 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Ready for number three?
L45529 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
L45528 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Okay, #2.
L45518 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Just do what I'm asking!
L45517 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Gary, don't worry, we --
L45516 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate.
L45071 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
L45070 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Hasn't affected his work, though.
L45069 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ There may be a little less trust after your outburst.
L45068 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ What'd the girl say?
L44964 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Maybe we should all get on it.
L44963 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ 'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
L44962 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ This is good. Who did it?
L45619 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Cool.
L45618 +++$+++ u350 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?
L45614 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Got out of my other commitment.
L45613 +++$+++ u350 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ ...You wanna work -- here?
L45612 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ We'll come up with the next big thing.
L45611 +++$+++ u350 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
L45092 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Those really weird, short lines.
L45091 +++$+++ u350 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
L45090 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
L45089 +++$+++ u350 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
L45088 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Just thought his work should go on.
L45087 +++$+++ u350 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
L45086 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
L44817 +++$+++ u350 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ I mean, it's your life.
L44816 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You do?
L44815 +++$+++ u350 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ I think you should go.
L44811 +++$+++ u350 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.
L44810 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.
L45567 +++$+++ u352 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LEN +++$+++ I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
L45566 +++$+++ u358 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ SHROT +++$+++ Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
L45462 +++$+++ u352 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LEN +++$+++ Where we going?
L45461 +++$+++ u358 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ SHROT +++$+++ Come with me.
L45459 +++$+++ u358 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ SHROT +++$+++ I'm calling Gary.
L45458 +++$+++ u352 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LEN +++$+++ You calling Phil and Randy?
L45427 +++$+++ u358 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ SHROT +++$+++ They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.
L45426 +++$+++ u352 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LEN +++$+++ Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here, anyway?
L45360 +++$+++ u358 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ SHROT +++$+++ Let's get him in here.
L45359 +++$+++ u352 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LEN +++$+++ Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.
L45341 +++$+++ u358 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ SHROT +++$+++ Any irregularity in the pattern.
L45340 +++$+++ u352 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LEN +++$+++ What're we looking for?
L45339 +++$+++ u358 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ SHROT +++$+++ Keep looking.
L45338 +++$+++ u352 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LEN +++$+++ Every entry was authorized.
L45280 +++$+++ u358 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ SHROT +++$+++ Not yet. 'Love to bust my ass cause I'm not in frigging Mensa.  I swear to God, it's that kid Milo, I told 'em so in the first place, but they didn't even wanna hear about it.  Let's run a printout on card entries.
L45279 +++$+++ u352 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LEN +++$+++ Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
L45278 +++$+++ u358 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ SHROT +++$+++ Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?
L45549 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Wait a second. He knows I know.
L45548 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Latitude 47 degrees.
L45538 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ He's been altering the coordinates since we logged on. He's a step ahead. Let's jump to #12.
L45537 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ What?
L45536 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ ...He knows.
L45527 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Let's try #2.
L45526 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Maybe it's the satellite.
L45490 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ But you said the other --
L45489 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Bring it to the other location.
L45488 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ It's three years old, it --
L45487 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop?
L45486 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
L45485 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Meet me at the other location.
L45433 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
L45432 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Please don't go.
L45431 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
L45430 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Why?!
L45429 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
L45428 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Does he know you know?
L45384 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ You'll come up with something.
L45383 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ That's lame, isn't it?
L45382 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
L45381 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
L45380 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.
L45370 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
L45369 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Oh.
L45368 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
L45367 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
L45366 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ He doesn't know about the Day Care.
L45365 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
L45364 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
L45363 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Thank God.
L45362 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ The dishes are juiced up, too.
L45361 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.
L45333 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Gary.
L45332 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
L45331 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ "A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"
L45330 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ What'd he say?
L45329 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I told Teddy about you.
L45328 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ 'Cause their apartments might be bugged?
L45327 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ 'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?
L45326 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
L45325 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Why were you snooping in my office?
L45324 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally?
L45323 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Why were you so careless?
L45321 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
L45320 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I don't know --
L45319 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ You mean -- break in?
L45318 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
L45317 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Before they kill somebody else, too.
L45316 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
L45315 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
L45314 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
L45313 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ But they'd still get the idea, right?
L45312 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
L45311 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ A what?
L45310 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.
L45309 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this --  mega-network for Skywire. Let's use it.
L45308 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ What?
L45307 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ How close are you?
L45303 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!
L45302 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Time?
L45301 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Say there's just one "mole" working there, like Barton at the DOJ. How do we know he's not the guy we've contacted? Or she? Or the guy she works for?
L45300 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
L45299 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
L45298 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ What about "60 Minutes."
L45297 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire.
L45284 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Certainly not at my happy home.
L45283 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
L45282 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
L45281 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.
L45277 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
L45276 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Do we post it on the Net?
L45271 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.
L45270 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Who can we trust?
L45269 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.
L45268 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ What about the FBI?
L45262 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ No, no. Never.
L45261 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.
L45260 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Hmm?
L45259 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ ...Milo?
L45256 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."
L45255 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ He's out of prison?
L45254 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ They'd frame him.
L45253 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
L45251 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Oh yeah?
L45250 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.
L45246 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make "sense." I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much.
L45245 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ But why would they --?
L45244 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.
L45242 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ The Day Care?
L45241 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
L45240 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Why would you do a thing like --
L45239 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I snuck into #21.
L45049 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ She saved my life.
L45048 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ That's great. I -- didn't know.
L45040 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Then and now.  But not right now.
L45039 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?
L45038 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Long story. Not that interesting.
L45037 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Why's that?
L45036 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
L45035 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You're compulsive.
L45034 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
L45033 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
L45032 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
L45031 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ "There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
L45030 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
L45029 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ No. Please.
L45028 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Did you wanna be alone?
L44993 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --
L44992 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Cool!
L44991 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Show me.
L44990 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
L44989 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ What've you got there?
L44987 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
L44986 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Did I say something?
L44985 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Didn't mean to pry. I just have this theory. Some of us who got to good at this? We were -- escaping something.
L44984 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ ...Something like that. Yeah.
L44983 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
L44982 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
L44981 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ ...Were you?
L44980 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
L44979 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
L44978 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ You're famous around here.

L45065 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ What does that mean?
L45064 +++$+++ u359 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
