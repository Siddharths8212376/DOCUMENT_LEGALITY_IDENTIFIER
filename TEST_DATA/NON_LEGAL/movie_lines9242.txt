L360418 +++$+++ u1951 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
L360417 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
L360416 +++$+++ u1951 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
L360415 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah. Sure.
L360414 +++$+++ u1951 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You vouch for him?
L360413 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
L360412 +++$+++ u1951 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
L360411 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ He'll work it off.
L360410 +++$+++ u1951 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
L360409 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You told him you liked him.
L360408 +++$+++ u1951 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
L360407 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
L360406 +++$+++ u1951 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
L360405 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Ruiz knows about this?
L360404 +++$+++ u1951 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
L360403 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah.
L360402 +++$+++ u1951 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I got a way we make everybody happy.
L360401 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah. Sorry.
L360400 +++$+++ u1951 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
L360399 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I know.
L360398 +++$+++ u1951 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.
L360397 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No.
L360396 +++$+++ u1951 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
L360395 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I don't want to drive another girl, Max. The only reason I'm --
L360394 +++$+++ u1951 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you.
L360393 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I don't understand.
L360392 +++$+++ u1951 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
L360391 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Then what are you saying?
L360390 +++$+++ u1951 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I didn't say that.
L360389 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ So, that's it. I'm out?
L360388 +++$+++ u1951 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
L360387 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What?
L360386 +++$+++ u1951 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Not driving Jess, you won't.
L360385 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'll work it off.
L360384 +++$+++ u1951 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand.
L360383 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
L360382 +++$+++ u1951 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
L360381 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ They were out of line --
L360380 +++$+++ u1951 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
L360379 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
L360378 +++$+++ u1951 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
L360377 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ That's why they call it the smart money.
L360376 +++$+++ u1951 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
L360375 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ She was fast, huh?
L360374 +++$+++ u1951 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ A million. Easy.
L360373 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Pshhh...
L360372 +++$+++ u1951 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
L360371 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ This one?
L360370 +++$+++ u1951 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
L360369 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Why?
L360368 +++$+++ u1951 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?
L360367 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Me? No. Not really.
L360366 +++$+++ u1951 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You bet the ponies?
L360365 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Sure. Yeah.
L360364 +++$+++ u1951 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You like the ponies?
L361050 +++$+++ u1953 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RUIZ +++$+++ You three are gonna meet him for dinner. Find out if and where. Now any of you motherfuckers got anything else to say?
L361049 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Where's the drop?
L361048 +++$+++ u1953 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RUIZ +++$+++ Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight.
L361041 +++$+++ u1953 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RUIZ +++$+++ Tom, the Welsh dude --
L361040 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What's the plan?
L361033 +++$+++ u1953 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RUIZ +++$+++ I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.
L361032 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ A bad heart.
L361028 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Nah, man...
L361027 +++$+++ u1953 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RUIZ +++$+++ Don't 'easy Ruiz' me. Y'all turned a Easter egg hunt into a butt-fuck-a- thon.  Bring me four eggs Benedict and a mimosa. You all want mimosas?
L361021 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Good morning.
L361020 +++$+++ u1953 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RUIZ +++$+++ Jesus Christ, where the fuck you been all night? You look like you got shit out in the gorilla house.
L360908 +++$+++ u1953 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RUIZ +++$+++ Now that Limey motherfucker's jumpy and wants to change shit around on me. Maxie's gonna shit a Nokia when he hears about... Aw, shit, I better call him before he hears.
L360907 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ We get it. We're sorry.
L360906 +++$+++ u1953 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RUIZ +++$+++ 'Dis?' 'Dis?' You're not in a position to 'dis', or 'give props', or whatever your Real World sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. You're nothing. You're wallpaper. You're not here to make fucking friends. Asking a motherfucker where he lives. And who the fuck told you 'Red Dragon'?.
L360867 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What drill?
L360866 +++$+++ u1953 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RUIZ +++$+++ That's him. Now you all know the drill, right?
L361200 +++$+++ u1949 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Yeah, he's getting there on his own.
L361199 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Taken care of?
L361198 +++$+++ u1949 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Ricky's taken care of.
L361197 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
L360824 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah.
L360823 +++$+++ u1949 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Understand me?
L360822 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah?
L360821 +++$+++ u1949 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
L360820 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
L360817 +++$+++ u1949 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ You know, white kids with trust funds acting like they're poor. Keeping it real. Know what I mean?
L360816 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ 'Trustafarians?'
L360813 +++$+++ u1949 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Depends what night.
L360812 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah.
L360811 +++$+++ u1949 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Spa?
L360744 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No. That's cool, man.
L360743 +++$+++ u1949 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I can wait around if you want.
L360742 +++$+++ u1949 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Well, this is the corner.
L360741 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No. Just the cross streets.
L360740 +++$+++ u1949 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ You don't know where you're going?
L360739 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
L360738 +++$+++ u1949 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
L360737 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
L360655 +++$+++ u1949 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Soho.
L360654 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Where is the Soho Grand?
L360636 +++$+++ u1949 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Traveling light. I like that.
L360635 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Nah.
L360634 +++$+++ u1949 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
L360633 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
L360632 +++$+++ u1949 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
L360631 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What's that?
L360628 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Bobby.
L360627 +++$+++ u1949 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Hi. I'm Jimmy.
L360626 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Hi. I, uh, think that's us.
L360732 +++$+++ u1945 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HISPANIC KID +++$+++ I be off in a minute.  Say again...?
L360731 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Listen, man, we really gotta...
L360730 +++$+++ u1945 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HISPANIC KID +++$+++ So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
L360729 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ It's important.
L360728 +++$+++ u1945 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HISPANIC KID +++$+++ I'm on the phone.
L360727 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Excuse me, we need to make a call.
L360726 +++$+++ u1945 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HISPANIC KID +++$+++ Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...
L360865 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Thanks.
L360864 +++$+++ u1943 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ DOORMAN +++$+++ Any time, bro.
L360863 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
L360862 +++$+++ u1943 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ DOORMAN +++$+++ Sorry, man, but...
L360846 +++$+++ u1943 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ DOORMAN +++$+++ He's not here.
L360845 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Can you check?
L360844 +++$+++ u1943 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ DOORMAN +++$+++ Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
L360843 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
L360842 +++$+++ u1943 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ DOORMAN +++$+++ Ruiz isn't here.
L360841 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ We're with Ruiz.
L361259 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'll be a minute.
L361258 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ No. I'll wait here.
L361257 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
L361256 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Dude, we were practically made...
L361242 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Take us right to Kennedy. Now.
L361241 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.
L361125 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Easy...
L361124 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
L361121 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You're not getting a gun.
L361120 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
L361119 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Where do you get this shit?
L361118 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Think about it: You knocked out that Jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. Maybe lost his whole line of clientele? He knows you're fucking up Jess' dancing, and I got a feeling he knows I stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. He can't kill us in LA cause that leads to too many questions. So he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that's turned into whatever? He can make us disappear out here real nice...
L361117 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed.
L361116 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
L361115 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I don't want to take any more chances.
L361114 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Three and a half hours?
L361113 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Let's just go now and wait.
L361112 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ So what do we do?
L361111 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
L361110 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
L361109 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No more, man.
L361108 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ It's gonna be fine.
L361107 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
L361106 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ I'm sorry...
L361105 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
L361104 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
L361103 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
L361102 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Calm down.
L361101 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...
L361100 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ What about it?
L361099 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
L361098 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ You did?
L361097 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
L361096 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
L361095 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What happened to the fifteen hundred?
L361094 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Eighty five.
L361093 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Eighty bucks?!?
L361092 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Eighty.
L361091 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What do you have left?
L361090 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ No.
L361089 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You're out of money?
L361088 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
L361087 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Why?
L361086 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Float me a hundred bucks.
L361085 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ It was six in the fucking morning.
L361084 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
L361083 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
L361082 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Wanna bet?
L361081 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You wouldn't even know where to get one.
L361080 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ All the more reason.
L361079 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
L361078 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ I'm pretty sure we do.
L361077 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ We don't need guns.
