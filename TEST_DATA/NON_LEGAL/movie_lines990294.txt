L502368 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Perfect for a child.
L502355 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ God, I've never seen anything like this before.  Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
L502354 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Sure is.
L502320 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Uh...huh.
L502319 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.
L502253 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Great.  Look, I'm at the hotel and I still have an awful lot to go through.  I don't think I can get home before nine or ten.
L502252 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Hi, hon.  How's it going?
L502251 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Hi, babe.
L502374 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, it's very... homely.
L502373 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.
L502351 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Oh...
L502350 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'd better collect my family first.
L502347 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Oh fine.  Well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away.
L502346 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Right there.
L502345 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Oh... Has your luggage been brought in?
L502344 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No, my son's discovered the games room.
L502343 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Good.  Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.  Is your family having a look around?
L502342 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No problem.  In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
L502341 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Good morning Jack.  I hope you haven't been waiting too long.
L502247 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, you can rest assured Mr. Ullman, that's not going to happen with me, and eg as far as my wife is concerned, I am sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it.  She's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict.
L502246 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
L502245 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Well, obviously some people can be
L502242 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, that is eh quite a story.
L502241 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ shut in together over long periods of time.
L502240 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
L502236 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Well, my predecessor in this job
L502235 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't believe they did.
L502234 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ I don't suppose they eh told you anything in Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970?
L502233 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm intrigued.
L502232 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.
L502230 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Great...
L502229 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ They'll love it.
L502228 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ How about your wife and son?  How do you think they'll take to it?
L502227 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Not for me.
L502226 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ can of itself be a problem.
L502225 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
L502224 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ five months of peace is just what I want.
L502223 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... 
L502222 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
L502221 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, that sounds fine to me.
L502220 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ ...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
L502219 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Well...
L502218 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Only in a very general way.
L502214 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Oh, it sure would be
L502213 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
L502212 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Let's see, where were we?  Yes.  I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May.
L502178 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Susie.
L502177 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind.  Thanks.
L502176 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?
L502175 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Well, that's very good time, very good.  Please sit down a minute.
L502174 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
L502173 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Have any trouble finding us?
L502169 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.
L502168 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Very nice to meet you.
L502167 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Oh, well - come on in Jack.
L502166 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm Jack Torrance.
L502165 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Yes?
L502164 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Mr. Ullman?
L502471 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Yes.
L502470 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Just like a ghost ship, huh?
L502469 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ By five o'clock tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here.
L502468 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Yes, well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
L502467 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ It's amazing how much activity is going on today.
L502450 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ How're you getting on?
L502449 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Hi.
L502448 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Hi.
L502409 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Thank you, Susie.
L502408 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Thanks.
L502388 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?
L502387 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ We can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably.
L502386 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Oh, I'll say.
L502385 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.
L502384 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors.
L502383 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ As a matter of fact we eh... brought a decorator in from Chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.
L502363 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Oh!
L502362 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
L502361 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ All the best people.
L502360 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Royalty?
L502359 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ even before anybody knew what a jet set was.  We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.
L502357 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Oh well they're really gorgeous. As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.
L502356 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.
L502353 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Oh, it's beautiful.  My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
L502352 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ This is our Colorado Lounge.
L502349 +++$+++ u7618 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WATSON +++$+++ Fine.
L502348 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Bill, would you have the Torrances' things brought in their apartment.
L502338 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Well, that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first.
L502337 +++$+++ u7618 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WATSON +++$+++ Eight thirty.
L502336 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ What time does the plane leave?
L502205 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Jack is a schoolteacher.
L502204 +++$+++ u7618 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WATSON +++$+++ Fine.
L502203 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter.  I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.
L502198 +++$+++ u7618 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WATSON +++$+++ How do you do?
L502197 +++$+++ u7617 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ ULLMAN +++$+++ Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.
L506992 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because I promised, but you two are going to bed. Go on, now, scoot.
L506991 +++$+++ u7620 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ The moon's not down yet...
L506981 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ When me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two.
L506980 +++$+++ u7620 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Sure, Uncle Al.
L506979 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ Can I tell you kids something?
L506957 +++$+++ u7620 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
L506956 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
L506940 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ Jesus.
L506939 +++$+++ u7620 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Blue. This blue.
L506938 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ Lowe's car-?
L506905 +++$+++ u7620 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Why hasn't he picked up the phone and told Constable Haller that someone is sending him poison-pen letters?
L506904 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
L506903 +++$+++ u7620 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
L506888 +++$+++ u7620 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Uncle Al-
L506887 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!
L507014 +++$+++ u7620 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ You're a real booger, you know it?
L507013 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
L507012 +++$+++ u7620 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Are you all right, Marty?
L507001 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Jane-
L507000 +++$+++ u7620 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Don't you touch me, snotbrains!
L506964 +++$+++ u7620 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Will you?
L506963 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Please, Uncle Al.
L506955 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Will you marry me, Jane?
L506954 +++$+++ u7620 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
L506953 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Jane... you don't have to do that.
L506859 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Jane, I have to talk to you.
L506858 +++$+++ u7620 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Went shopping. Why?
L506857 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Where's Mom?
L506856 +++$+++ u7620 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning.
L506692 +++$+++ u7620 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Let me help you up.
L506691 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Yes. Go away.
L506689 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Stop it!
L506688 +++$+++ u7620 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
L506687 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
L506621 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
L506620 +++$+++ u7620 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I don't want your money. You're a booger.
L506619 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
L506618 +++$+++ u7620 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ What's the money for?
L506616 +++$+++ u7620 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it.
L506615 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.
L506611 +++$+++ u7620 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Brady's a booger and so are you!
L506610 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
L506609 +++$+++ u7620 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
L506663 +++$+++ u7623 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty?
L506662 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
L506661 +++$+++ u7623 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.
L506657 +++$+++ u7623 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's-
L506656 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Rats...
L506655 +++$+++ u7623 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ Rattling. Rustling.
L506654 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ What kind of noises?
L506653 +++$+++ u7623 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ I've been hearing noises in there.
L506652 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ What?
L506651 +++$+++ u7623 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ There's something else scary.
L506650 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
L506649 +++$+++ u7623 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but...
L506645 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Well... it is his third.
L506644 +++$+++ u7623 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ For getting a divorce?
L506643 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
L506642 +++$+++ u7623 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ What's that?
L506641 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.
L506639 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.
L506638 +++$+++ u7623 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ You booger.
L506994 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  Go on, now.
L506993 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ What if I say no?
L506990 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten past one. He's not coming.
L506989 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ But Uncle Al! You said-
L506988 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.
L506983 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
L506982 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Yeah? Really?
L506962 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Will you do it?
L506961 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
L506960 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
L506959 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
L506958 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.
L506952 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
L506951 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ I saw what I saw.
L506950 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ You're not going to let it go, are you?
L506949 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
L506948 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy?
L506947 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!
L506937 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ No.
L506936 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
L506935 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ It could have been anything, Marty.
L506934 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ There! You see!
L506933 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
L506928 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ I told you!
L506927 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did.  He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.
L506926 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.
L506925 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ I told you!
L506924 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.
L506910 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you?
L506909 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
L506908 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
L506907 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ Marty, do you see your suspect?
L506906 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller.
L506900 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
L506899 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
L506898 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ You want to know what I think?
L506897 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
L506896 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.
L506895 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Well... was it a prescription?
L506894 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
L506893 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
L506892 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ What the hell does that matter?
L506891 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Was it a prescription?
L506890 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
L506889 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch!
