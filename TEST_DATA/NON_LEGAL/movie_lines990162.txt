L409888 +++$+++ u6831 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ OWNER +++$+++ Seems a little loose!
L409887 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ Okay.
L409886 +++$+++ u6831 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ OWNER +++$+++ Most folks around here got no use for nigrahs. Got to understand them, that's all. How you doin', boy?
L409885 +++$+++ u6831 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ OWNER +++$+++ Just tryin' to be helpful.
L409884 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ No, thanks.
L409883 +++$+++ u6831 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ OWNER +++$+++ Want me to hold the light for you?
L409882 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ Okay.
L409881 +++$+++ u6831 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ OWNER +++$+++ How you doin', boy?
L410021 +++$+++ u6830 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Good-bye, Duff.
L410020 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ Who is?!
L410019 +++$+++ u6830 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I know he wasn't much of a father.
L410018 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ Hell, I'm just like him.
L410017 +++$+++ u6830 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Don't be too hard on him.
L410016 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ Okay.
L410015 +++$+++ u6830 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
L410014 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ I can always chop cotton if I have to.  If you want a ride, I'll take you home.
L410013 +++$+++ u6830 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ How 'you gonna live?
L410012 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ No, they won't.
L410011 +++$+++ u6830 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ They'll run you out.
L410010 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ That's right.
L410009 +++$+++ u6830 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Going back, huh?
L410008 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
L410007 +++$+++ u6830 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Well, what're you going to do?
L410006 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ Sure.
L410005 +++$+++ u6830 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ It's just that I hate empty rooms.
L410004 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ No thanks, Lee.
L410003 +++$+++ u6830 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.
L409963 +++$+++ u6830 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
L409962 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ Come on, Pop.
L409560 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ Yeah, sure. Good luck.
L409559 +++$+++ u6830 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Come back some other time, will you?
L409548 +++$+++ u6830 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around.
L409547 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ How often is that?
L409546 +++$+++ u6830 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Whenever he's got an edge on.
L409545 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ How often does he get like that?
L409865 +++$+++ u6833 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ REVEREND DAWSON +++$+++ I'll be seeing you.
L409864 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ Oh yeah?
L409863 +++$+++ u6833 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ REVEREND DAWSON +++$+++ Maybe I could talk to Bud Ellis. He might have a job for you at his filling station.
L409860 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ Well, at least she ain't married to no white man's nigger! You been stoopin' so long, Reverend, you don't even know how to stand straight no more. You' just half a man!
L409859 +++$+++ u6833 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ REVEREND DAWSON +++$+++ You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
L409858 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
L409857 +++$+++ u6833 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ REVEREND DAWSON +++$+++ It's for your own good.
L409856 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ So I been told.
L409853 +++$+++ u6833 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ REVEREND DAWSON +++$+++ Don't you get smart with me, boy.
L409852 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ I guess I'll rob a bank.
L409851 +++$+++ u6833 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ REVEREND DAWSON +++$+++ You'll be in trouble, son.  Now just how do you intend to support your family?
L409850 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ It ain't in me.
L409849 +++$+++ u6833 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ REVEREND DAWSON +++$+++ Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
L409848 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ Don't look like there's a right way.
L409847 +++$+++ u6833 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ REVEREND DAWSON +++$+++ I know just how you feel, son. But believe me, you're going about it the wrong way.
L409441 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ Well, that figures.  Kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!
L409440 +++$+++ u6833 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ REVEREND DAWSON +++$+++ And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
L409439 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ I guess not.
L409438 +++$+++ u6833 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ REVEREND DAWSON +++$+++ I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
L409437 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ I doubt it.
L409436 +++$+++ u6833 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ REVEREND DAWSON +++$+++ I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
L409435 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.
L409434 +++$+++ u6833 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ REVEREND DAWSON +++$+++ Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
L409433 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ I guess I ain't.
L409432 +++$+++ u6833 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ REVEREND DAWSON +++$+++ Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
L409431 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.
L409430 +++$+++ u6833 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ REVEREND DAWSON +++$+++ Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.
L409429 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
L409428 +++$+++ u6833 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ REVEREND DAWSON +++$+++ Well, it looks like we'll be getting our new school.
L409427 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ Thank you.
L409426 +++$+++ u6833 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ REVEREND DAWSON +++$+++ It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
L409425 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ Guess it's never been easy.
L409424 +++$+++ u6833 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ REVEREND DAWSON +++$+++ It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.
L409414 +++$+++ u6833 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ REVEREND DAWSON +++$+++ All right, son.
L409413 +++$+++ u6822 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ DUFF +++$+++ How are you?
L409412 +++$+++ u6833 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ REVEREND DAWSON +++$+++ Hello.
L409594 +++$+++ u6825 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ FRANKIE +++$+++ I guess you'll be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
L409593 +++$+++ u6826 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ JOCKO +++$+++ You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
L409592 +++$+++ u6825 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ FRANKIE +++$+++ Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
L409591 +++$+++ u6826 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ JOCKO +++$+++ Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.
L409583 +++$+++ u6825 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ FRANKIE +++$+++ What're you gonna get out of it, huh?
L409582 +++$+++ u6826 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ JOCKO +++$+++ 'Musta knocked her up.
L409581 +++$+++ u6825 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ FRANKIE +++$+++ I'll be a monkey's kid sister! What d'you want to do a thing like that for?
L409328 +++$+++ u6826 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ JOCKO +++$+++ How you doin'?  Hi there!
L409327 +++$+++ u6825 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ FRANKIE +++$+++ Well, if it ain't Duff!
L409289 +++$+++ u6826 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ JOCKO +++$+++ Hell, they're all after the same thing.
L409288 +++$+++ u6825 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ FRANKIE +++$+++ Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
L409287 +++$+++ u6826 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ JOCKO +++$+++ Man, you won't like that back seat.
L409223 +++$+++ u6825 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ FRANKIE +++$+++ 'Oughta give up smoking, Jocko.
L409222 +++$+++ u6826 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ JOCKO +++$+++ Why don't you guys buy your own?
L409295 +++$+++ u6826 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ JOCKO +++$+++ Is that right?  Think you're gonna make it with her?
L409294 +++$+++ u6832 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
L409293 +++$+++ u6826 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ JOCKO +++$+++ Hell, I didn't know you was married.
L409292 +++$+++ u6832 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Well, I got married to one of them.
L409291 +++$+++ u6826 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ JOCKO +++$+++ What d'you know about women, Pop?
L409290 +++$+++ u6832 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.
L409423 +++$+++ u6833 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ REVEREND DAWSON +++$+++ That'll make the folks very happy.
L409422 +++$+++ u6828 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ JOHNSON +++$+++ I'll talk to the Mayor.
L409421 +++$+++ u6833 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ REVEREND DAWSON +++$+++ I know.
L409420 +++$+++ u6828 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ JOHNSON +++$+++ Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
L409419 +++$+++ u6833 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ REVEREND DAWSON +++$+++ I understand.
L409418 +++$+++ u6828 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ JOHNSON +++$+++ So you're courtin' the preacher's girl. Well, just watch your step, boy, or he'll preach you right into hell.  I'm counting on you, Reverend.
L409979 +++$+++ u6837 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Anything you say, baby.
L409978 +++$+++ u6830 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Let's go.
L409974 +++$+++ u6830 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Right here.
L409973 +++$+++ u6837 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Better now.  Where 'you at?
L409972 +++$+++ u6830 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ What's the matter now?
L409971 +++$+++ u6837 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Got a thick feelin' here.
L409970 +++$+++ u6830 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Like hell you ain't!
L409969 +++$+++ u6837 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I ain't drunk, honey.
L409968 +++$+++ u6830 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Now you stay put!
L409557 +++$+++ u6837 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Okay, boy, beat it.
L409556 +++$+++ u6830 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ He's your son.
L409542 +++$+++ u6837 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You're breaking my heart.  Got to see a man about a dog.
L409541 +++$+++ u6830 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
L409540 +++$+++ u6837 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Is she good in the hay? No point marryin' her just to find out. Is there, baby?
L409539 +++$+++ u6837 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Okay, so what's a girl supposed to do? Me not workin' and her cleanin' house for a white man. I'm tellin' you, boy, keep away from marriage. Ya gotta stay light on your feet or you won't make it.
L409538 +++$+++ u6830 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Shut up, Will.
L409537 +++$+++ u6837 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
L409536 +++$+++ u6830 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Pour your own trouble, Will.
L409527 +++$+++ u6837 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
L409526 +++$+++ u6830 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Let's stay here, Will.
L409525 +++$+++ u6837 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
L409524 +++$+++ u6830 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ No. Why?
L409523 +++$+++ u6837 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What's the matter?! You mad at me?
L409522 +++$+++ u6830 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Come on, Will.
L409520 +++$+++ u6837 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ He's my son!
L409519 +++$+++ u6830 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Hi.
L409518 +++$+++ u6837 +++$+++ m455 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Baby - want you to meet Duff.
L410072 +++$+++ u6840 +++$+++ m456 +++$+++ OMAR +++$+++ Nice and slow. You come in. Get a look around.  Then I get my wife.
L410071 +++$+++ u6838 +++$+++ m456 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Omar, your wife's here.  Ny superiors: will allow me to make the trade now.  But I gotta see that you haven't hurt the other hostages.  If you haven't, I'11 take the girl and send in your wife.
L410050 +++$+++ u6840 +++$+++ m456 +++$+++ OMAR +++$+++ Enough talking!  We been talking for eleven fucking hours, man.  My throat's fucking raw!
L410049 +++$+++ u6838 +++$+++ m456 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...
L410048 +++$+++ u6840 +++$+++ m456 +++$+++ OMAR +++$+++ I'm sorry, Danny. Time's up. I'11 do the girl, then me. I don't give a fuck.
L410040 +++$+++ u6840 +++$+++ m456 +++$+++ OMAR +++$+++ No more goddamn talking!  I want the bitch or I'm gonna do the girl!
L410039 +++$+++ u6838 +++$+++ m456 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Omar, listen to me--
L410038 +++$+++ u6840 +++$+++ m456 +++$+++ OMAR +++$+++ I want my wife.  I told you and told you. Now I'm gettin' tired of this shit--
L410037 +++$+++ u6838 +++$+++ m456 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ She's coming, Omar, she's coming--
L410036 +++$+++ u6840 +++$+++ m456 +++$+++ OMAR +++$+++ Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore.  You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife?
L410035 +++$+++ u6838 +++$+++ m456 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Omar--
L410034 +++$+++ u6840 +++$+++ m456 +++$+++ OMAR +++$+++ Sometimes, I want to blow his fucking brains out!
L410033 +++$+++ u6838 +++$+++ m456 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Your Raoul?
L410032 +++$+++ u6840 +++$+++ m456 +++$+++ OMAR +++$+++ Sometimes.  And sometimes I don't--  Shut the fuck up!
L410031 +++$+++ u6838 +++$+++ m456 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You hate Raoul?
L410030 +++$+++ u6840 +++$+++ m456 +++$+++ OMAR +++$+++ I fucking hate Raoul.  Shut the fuck up, asshole! someone.
L410068 +++$+++ u6839 +++$+++ m456 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.
L410067 +++$+++ u6838 +++$+++ m456 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ We got any shots?
L410064 +++$+++ u6839 +++$+++ m456 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Negotiator entering Kill Zone.
L410063 +++$+++ u6838 +++$+++ m456 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I will.  Inside.  There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
L410062 +++$+++ u6839 +++$+++ m456 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target.  You'll get yourself killed.  Just keep talking.
L410061 +++$+++ u6838 +++$+++ m456 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I'm still on my honeymoon.
L410060 +++$+++ u6839 +++$+++ m456 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ How long's it been?
L410059 +++$+++ u6839 +++$+++ m456 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Since you got married.  You got someone else to think about now, Danny.
L410058 +++$+++ u6838 +++$+++ m456 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Since when?
L410057 +++$+++ u6839 +++$+++ m456 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
L410054 +++$+++ u6839 +++$+++ m456 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Nathan to HBT 1.  Negotiator is requesting more time.
L410053 +++$+++ u6838 +++$+++ m456 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
L410052 +++$+++ u6839 +++$+++ m456 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Beck's just put us on standby for crisis entry.
L410762 +++$+++ u6841 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ 3JANE +++$+++ Pity. Then you'll both have to die.
L410761 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
L410760 +++$+++ u6841 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ 3JANE +++$+++ You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
L410758 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Don't play with me.
L410757 +++$+++ u6841 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ 3JANE +++$+++ He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
L410756 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Take this off.
L410754 +++$+++ u6841 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ 3JANE +++$+++ Then we would have talked, you and I.
L410753 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ No. I only needed the code from you.
L410752 +++$+++ u6841 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ 3JANE +++$+++ Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
L410621 +++$+++ u6841 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ 3JANE +++$+++ Of course.
L410620 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
L410619 +++$+++ u6841 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ 3JANE +++$+++ I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
L410618 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Let me get you another glass of wine.
L410616 +++$+++ u6841 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ 3JANE +++$+++ I'm fine.
L410615 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
L410796 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ Of course...
L410795 +++$+++ u6841 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ 3JANE +++$+++ What about her?
L410794 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
L410793 +++$+++ u6841 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ 3JANE +++$+++ You're hurt...
L410742 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.
L410741 +++$+++ u6841 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ 3JANE +++$+++ Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.

L410732 +++$+++ u6841 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ 3JANE +++$+++ She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
L410782 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
