L98689 +++$+++ u4148 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ALI +++$+++ Go away!
L98931 +++$+++ u4151 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ BEN M'HIDI +++$+++ Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.
L98930 +++$+++ u4148 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ALI +++$+++ To show them to the UN, right?
L98929 +++$+++ u4151 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ BEN M'HIDI +++$+++ That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...
L98928 +++$+++ u4148 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ALI +++$+++ Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.
L98927 +++$+++ u4151 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ BEN M'HIDI +++$+++ Why?
L98926 +++$+++ u4148 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ALI +++$+++ No, and neither were my men.
L98925 +++$+++ u4151 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ BEN M'HIDI +++$+++ But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
L98924 +++$+++ u4148 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ALI +++$+++ No ...
L98923 +++$+++ u4151 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ BEN M'HIDI +++$+++ No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
L98922 +++$+++ u4148 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ALI +++$+++ It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
L98921 +++$+++ u4151 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ BEN M'HIDI +++$+++ Yes, I think so too ... It's been organized well ... But what will the French do?
L98920 +++$+++ u4148 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ALI +++$+++ I think it'll be a success ...
L98919 +++$+++ u4151 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ BEN M'HIDI +++$+++ What do you think of the strike, Ali?
L98916 +++$+++ u4148 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ALI +++$+++ It's a question of habit ...
L98915 +++$+++ u4151 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ BEN M'HIDI +++$+++ It's good nobody is following us ...
L98914 +++$+++ u4151 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ BEN M'HIDI +++$+++ Let's try ...
L98913 +++$+++ u4148 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ALI +++$+++ Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...
L98811 +++$+++ u4160 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ SOLDIER +++$+++ I'm sorry. Tomorrow. Tonight is out of the question.
L98810 +++$+++ u4149 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ARNAUD +++$+++ Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.
L98809 +++$+++ u4160 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ SOLDIER +++$+++ It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight.
L98808 +++$+++ u4149 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ARNAUD +++$+++ But it's not even midnight yet!
L98807 +++$+++ u4160 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ SOLDIER +++$+++ It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
L98806 +++$+++ u4149 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ARNAUD +++$+++ Good evening ... Can we pass?
L98794 +++$+++ u4152 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ EMPLOYEE +++$+++ Good evening, sir.
L98793 +++$+++ u4150 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER +++$+++ All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
L98792 +++$+++ u4152 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ EMPLOYEE +++$+++ Rue de Thèbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...
L98791 +++$+++ u4150 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER +++$+++ Tell me ... Where is this rue de Thèbes?
L98790 +++$+++ u4152 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ EMPLOYEE +++$+++ Good evening, sir.
L98789 +++$+++ u4150 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER +++$+++ Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you tomorrow.
L98771 +++$+++ u4152 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ EMPLOYEE +++$+++ Intersection, between Consular Street and General Laquiere Avenue ...
L98770 +++$+++ u4150 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER +++$+++ Where were we?
L99127 +++$+++ u4153 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Why, yes, of course ... But for the moment, let's be satisfied with Algiers! In the mountains our work is always easier.
L99126 +++$+++ u4156 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ MATHIEU +++$+++ Bah, for that matter, Algeria isn't the only country in the world ...
L99123 +++$+++ u4153 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Let's hope forever.
L99122 +++$+++ u4156 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ MATHIEU +++$+++ Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.
L99121 +++$+++ u4153 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ And so the tapeworm no longer has a head. Are you satisfied, Mathieu? In Algiers everything should be over.
L98891 +++$+++ u4153 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Yes, a name for the operation.
L98890 +++$+++ u4156 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ MATHIEU +++$+++ A name?
L98889 +++$+++ u4153 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...
L99081 +++$+++ u4155 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ KADER +++$+++ She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.
L99080 +++$+++ u4156 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ MATHIEU +++$+++ What is she saying?
L99079 +++$+++ u4156 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ MATHIEU +++$+++ No. Let's just say that you've given me the satisfaction to have guessed correctly. But from the technical point of view, it isn't possible to speak of advantages. By now the game is over. The NLF has been defeated.
L99078 +++$+++ u4155 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ KADER +++$+++ That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.
L99077 +++$+++ u4156 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ MATHIEU +++$+++ Of course I am.
L99076 +++$+++ u4155 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ KADER +++$+++ You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...
L99075 +++$+++ u4156 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ MATHIEU +++$+++ For many months, I've had your photo on my desk together with a dozen or so reports on you ... And naturally, I am under the illusion that I know you somewhat. You never seemed the type, Kader, inclined to performing useless actions.
L99074 +++$+++ u4155 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ KADER +++$+++ Why?
L99055 +++$+++ u4156 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ MATHIEU +++$+++ Yes ... But let me first see you.
L99054 +++$+++ u4157 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ MOURAD +++$+++ Are you ready, colonel?
L99052 +++$+++ u4156 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ MATHIEU +++$+++ Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ...
L99051 +++$+++ u4157 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ MOURAD +++$+++ We'll lower a basket from the window ...
L99050 +++$+++ u4156 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ MATHIEU +++$+++ How can I give you this statement?
L99049 +++$+++ u4157 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ MOURAD +++$+++ Okay. But we want your promise for a fair trial in writing. Give us a written statement, Mathieu, and then we'll surrender.
L99047 +++$+++ u4157 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ MOURAD +++$+++ We don't trust you, colonel. Come forward, show yourself.
L99046 +++$+++ u4156 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ MATHIEU +++$+++ Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
L99045 +++$+++ u4157 +++$+++ m277 +++$+++ MOURAD +++$+++ Who is speaking?
L99987 +++$+++ u4161 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ BIGGS +++$+++ Thanks, Mister D.
L99986 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ You did a good job, Charlie.
L99985 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I don't know.
L99984 +++$+++ u4161 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ BIGGS +++$+++ You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
L99983 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Take some time off.
L99896 +++$+++ u4161 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ BIGGS +++$+++ She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty slick.
L99895 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
L99894 +++$+++ u4161 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ BIGGS +++$+++ What good does that do -- it's the old will?
L99893 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Here it is!  According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
L99891 +++$+++ u4161 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ BIGGS +++$+++ What would Joanne Braslow need with an estate attorney?  She wasn't even mentioned in Marsh's will.
L99890 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Joe Koehler.  I know him.  He's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive.
L99889 +++$+++ u4161 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ BIGGS +++$+++ Joanne Braslow is getting more and more interesting.  I followed her today to an attorney's office. Joseph Koehler.
L99840 +++$+++ u4161 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ BIGGS +++$+++ Right now.  Guess who's been buying Coke from him for the last five and half years?
L99839 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Charlie -- are you going to make a point soon?
L99837 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ You got something on the Coke?
L99836 +++$+++ u4161 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ BIGGS +++$+++ I'm sorry to barge in -- but I figured after that bombshell that got laid on you today you could use some good news?
L99722 +++$+++ u4161 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ BIGGS +++$+++ Because it hasn't all been erased.
L99721 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Why?
L99720 +++$+++ u4161 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ BIGGS +++$+++ It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
L99719 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
L99718 +++$+++ u4161 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ BIGGS +++$+++ I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked.  It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't.  It's been erased without any input signal coming in.
L99711 +++$+++ u4161 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ BIGGS +++$+++ No -- but I got something.
L99710 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ You got something on the coke?
L99709 +++$+++ u4161 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ BIGGS +++$+++ I've been waiting for you to get back.
L99442 +++$+++ u4161 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ BIGGS +++$+++ I'm trying.
L99441 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
L99440 +++$+++ u4161 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ BIGGS +++$+++ Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke.
L99366 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I want you to hit all the dealers in town.  Give them a list of people close to Marsh and see if any of them use.  Then I want you to check out a Doctor Alan Paley.  He lives up in Roseburg.
L99365 +++$+++ u4161 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ BIGGS +++$+++ So -- where do we start?
L99364 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ We have to find out who else would profit from Marsh's death -- and who knew enough about his personal life to know that putting cocaine in the nasal spray would be fatal.
L99363 +++$+++ u4161 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ BIGGS +++$+++ I'm sorry, man -- but I ain't ever heard of no brother dying from gettin' too much pussy.
L99362 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ It could've happened to anyone.
L99361 +++$+++ u4161 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ BIGGS +++$+++ Yeah -- I hear they had 'em a real dog and pony show going on up there - -  I'll tell you, sometimes white people are a real puzzle to me.  I mean, did this old guy really think he was gonna be able to keep up with a sweet little number like that?
L99360 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Fine, Charlie.  You familiar with the Marsh case?
L99359 +++$+++ u4161 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ BIGGS +++$+++ How you doin' Mister D?
L99194 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Did I say it was a natural death?
L99193 +++$+++ u4177 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SATTLER +++$+++ Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.
L99192 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
L99191 +++$+++ u4177 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SATTLER +++$+++ An inquiry into what?
L99190 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
L99189 +++$+++ u4177 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SATTLER +++$+++ I don't think that this is the time, or the place.
L100053 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Then you can go.
L100052 +++$+++ u4179 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ TROXELL +++$+++ Yeah.
L99247 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ How?
L99246 +++$+++ u4179 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ TROXELL +++$+++ I think I'm going to make your day.
L99186 +++$+++ u4179 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ TROXELL +++$+++ That's the best part.  She gets it all -- everything.
L99185 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ What about the will?
L99184 +++$+++ u4179 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ TROXELL +++$+++ Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
L99183 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ So she knew about his heart?
L99182 +++$+++ u4179 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ TROXELL +++$+++ He can remember at least one occasion -- and the receptionist can recall two times when she accompanied Marsh to the office.
L99181 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ What did he say about Miss Lawson?
L99180 +++$+++ u4179 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ TROXELL +++$+++ Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day.  Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?
L99515 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Thank you, Doctor McCurdy.  Your witness.
L99514 +++$+++ u4171 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ MCCURDY +++$+++ It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
L99513 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
L99512 +++$+++ u4171 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ MCCURDY +++$+++ It would be an added stress to his heart.
L99511 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ -- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
L99510 +++$+++ u4171 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ MCCURDY +++$+++ Increase his heart rate.
L99509 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
L99508 +++$+++ u4171 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ MCCURDY +++$+++ Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
L99507 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A.  Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?
L99506 +++$+++ u4171 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ MCCURDY +++$+++ Yes.
L99505 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand?
L99504 +++$+++ u4171 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ MCCURDY +++$+++ We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on the nightstand.  It was filled with water and cocaine.  Mr. Marsh had a head cold at the time of his death.  I believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine.
L99503 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Then how did it get into his body?
L99502 +++$+++ u4171 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ MCCURDY +++$+++ I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
L99501 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
L99500 +++$+++ u4171 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ MCCURDY +++$+++ We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
L99499 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ What induced it?
L99498 +++$+++ u4171 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ MCCURDY +++$+++ No.
L99497 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
L99496 +++$+++ u4171 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ MCCURDY +++$+++ Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
L99495 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
L99494 +++$+++ u4171 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ MCCURDY +++$+++ A massive cardiac arrest.
L99493 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?
L99178 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the scene?
L99177 +++$+++ u4171 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ MCCURDY +++$+++ Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.
L99174 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Any prints on the nasal spray?
L99173 +++$+++ u4171 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ MCCURDY +++$+++ We know Marsh had a head cold.   We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand.  The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time.  He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.
L99172 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ What can we prove?
L99171 +++$+++ u4171 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ MCCURDY +++$+++ Yes.
L99170 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ What are you saying, Henry?  That his girlfriend fucked him to death?
L99168 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ But there's more?
L99167 +++$+++ u4171 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ MCCURDY +++$+++ That's what my report will read.
L99166 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ The official cause?
L99165 +++$+++ u4171 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ MCCURDY +++$+++ The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
L99164 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ What'd he die of?
L99163 +++$+++ u4171 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ MCCURDY +++$+++ Marsh wasn't alone.  We found traces of sperm on the sheets.  The toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood.
L99149 +++$+++ u4171 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ MCCURDY +++$+++ Not sure.  I'll have everything you need tomorrow.
L99148 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Cause?
L99147 +++$+++ u4171 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ MCCURDY +++$+++ About three hours.
L99674 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Your witness.
L99673 +++$+++ u4167 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ ESTER +++$+++ No -- never.
L99672 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?
L99670 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Could you be more specific?
L99669 +++$+++ u4167 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ ESTER +++$+++ Sex.
L99668 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ What was the nature of the argument?
L99667 +++$+++ u4167 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ ESTER +++$+++ Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
L99666 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Did they argue the day before he died?
L99665 +++$+++ u4167 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ ESTER +++$+++ You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
L99664 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ What did they argue about?
L99663 +++$+++ u4167 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ ESTER +++$+++ Like cats and dogs.
L99662 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
L99661 +++$+++ u4167 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ ESTER +++$+++ Yes.
L99660 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's maid for nine years?
L99906 +++$+++ u4169 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ JUDGE BURNHAM +++$+++ Counsel approach the bench.
L99905 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Objection, Your Honor.
L99862 +++$+++ u4169 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ JUDGE BURNHAM +++$+++ You may call your next witness.
L99861 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ No questions.
L99773 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Did Miss Lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving?
L99772 +++$+++ u4169 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ JUDGE BURNHAM +++$+++ Objection sustained.
L99744 +++$+++ u4169 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ JUDGE BURNHAM +++$+++ Alright -- I'm going to allow his testimony.
L99743 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
L99742 +++$+++ u4169 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ JUDGE BURNHAM +++$+++ Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
L99741 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's.
L100051 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ You get his statement?
L100050 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Can I go?
L99878 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.
L99877 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.
L99805 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Your Honor, I'm trying to establish the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was.
L99804 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
L99803 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
L99802 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Objection!
L99771 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ The opinion of a scorned lover is hardly an objective view.
L99770 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months.  I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.
L99769 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Objection.  The question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness.
L99740 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.
L99739 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.
L99707 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Her.  It's an obvious move.  I'm building a case against her, remember?
L99706 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ You've been following me?
L99705 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
L99704 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ You don't know what you're talking about.
L99703 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ I'm talking to you as a friend now. Don't ruin your life, your career for her.  She'll spit you out when this is over.
L99702 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ That's ridiculous.
L99700 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Back off, John.
L99699 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ What's happening to you, Frank? You're acting like you're on trial here.  This has become personal to you.
L99698 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I didn't hear it.
L99697 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
L99696 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I've got work to do.
L99690 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Your Honor -- please!
L99689 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I'm just curious to see if Mr. Troxell reconstructed anything else.
L99688 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Objection, Your Honor.  The fact that Mrs. Crawford heard Mr. Troxell reconstruct her sentence and decided to rephrase her words in a more intelligent manner for the court doesn't mean the incident never happened.
L99680 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I was just about to make my point, Your Honor.
