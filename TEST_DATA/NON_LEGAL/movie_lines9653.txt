L120876 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...don't do it to me...
L120875 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ ...to me.
L120874 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Please...
L120873 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hey, she came to talk...
L120872 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
L120871 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
L120870 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Listen, I would -
L120869 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
L120868 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
L120867 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
L120866 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Now, what does she have to do with all this?
L120865 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah.
L120864 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ My wife?
L120863 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.
L120862 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah.
L120861 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ ...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
L120860 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ All right.
L120859 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
L120858 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ All right.
L120857 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.
L120856 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yes, you lost your control.
L120855 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I lost control?
L120854 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You lost your control.
L120853 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah.
L120852 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ What happened to me? What happened to you?
L120851 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
L120850 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
L120849 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah?
L120848 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
L120847 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.
L120846 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.
L120845 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
L120844 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ That's all taken out of context. Okay.
L120843 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?
L120842 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.
L120841 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Fine.
L120840 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
L120839 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ All right, fine.
L120838 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'll be honest with you.
L120837 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Just say so.
L120836 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I don't wanna come along with you.
L120835 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You should say so.
L120834 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ No, I don't wanna come -
L120833 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
L120832 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license.  And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?
L120831 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.
L120830 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
L120829 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you?  All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.
L120828 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes.  You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI.
L120827 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You think he got the point?
L120810 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Hey.
L120809 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hey, Ace.
L120796 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.
L120795 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...very difficult to get in.
L120794 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...
L120793 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No, no it's okay.
L120787 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Listen...
L120786 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Hello.
L120461 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?
L120460 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ - no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy.
L120412 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hey, Rich.
L120411 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them.
L120327 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.
L120326 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
L120325 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ In so many words, yes.
L120324 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ In other words, I'm fucked.
L120323 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
L120322 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
L120321 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Nope, there's no way.
L120320 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
L120318 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.
L120317 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ ' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  Do you believe this shit?
L120316 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
L120315 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it.
L120255 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ All right.
L120254 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
L120253 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.
L120252 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you.
L120251 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
L120250 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.
L120249 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Why, somebody's complaining?
L120248 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already.
L120244 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Between...
L120243 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right?  So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him.
L120224 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You're still eight pounds over.  What's the reason for this?
L120223 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons.
L120219 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Thanks, pal.
L120218 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Okay.
L120217 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ All right, Ace?
L120216 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'm sorry about this. Really.
L120215 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.
L120200 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What? Ho-  Hey, come here.
L120199 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
L120198 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Then he called me a faggot.
L120197 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What?
L120196 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
L120195 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely...
L120194 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No.
L120193 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?
L120167 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.
L120166 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
L120165 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
L120164 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.
L120158 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Four aces, Doc.
L120157 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
L120149 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy.
L120148 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ ...the next thing I did, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.
L120143 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers.
L120142 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas.
L120066 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her -
L120065 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.'
L119946 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?  Yeah, right, I'm sure.
L119945 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message.
L119944 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
L119943 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Ohh!
L119908 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
L119907 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
L119903 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
L119902 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
L119901 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
L119900 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
L119899 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You mean, I have your permission?
L119898 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ No, of course not.
L119897 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
L119896 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it.
L119889 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Honey, come here.
L119888 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?
L119887 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Ginger.
L119886 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah.
L119885 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Somethin', huh?
L119884 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Okay, Sammy.
L119875 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Hey.
L119874 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ ...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
L119848 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I mean, he took care of himself only too well. And that's why every badge back home wanted to nail him.
L119847 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
L119846 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
L119677 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Listen...
L119676 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ While I was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', Nicky just hit him. No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead.
L119675 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta- take it easy.
L119674 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What's that? You hear? You hear a little girl, Frankie? You hear a little girl, Ace? Is that a little fuckin' girl?!  What happened to the fuckin' tough guy?  Told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! Huh?!
L119661 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ If he don't know, nobody knows. Told you it was eight.
L119660 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Eight.
L119659 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It was eight.  Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game.
L119651 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ How did Nicky collect?
L119650 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ They payin'?
L119649 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us.
L119605 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ If his girlfriend was knocked up.
L119604 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'll take Columbia for twenty.
L119598 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.
L119597 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
L119596 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
L119595 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
L119583 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.
L119582 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ ...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it.
L119519 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. Except you gotta do it right. I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time? Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes. You could be there all fuckin' night.
L119518 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.
L119513 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Matter of fact...
L119512 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.
L120674 +++$+++ u4373 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WEBB +++$+++ You bet.
L120673 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ No problem.  Sorry.
L120672 +++$+++ u4373 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WEBB +++$+++ Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time.
L120671 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Okay, thanks.  Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry.
L120670 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
L120669 +++$+++ u4373 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WEBB +++$+++ Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
L120668 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
L120667 +++$+++ u4373 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WEBB +++$+++ You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.  But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.
L120666 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.
L120665 +++$+++ u4373 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WEBB +++$+++ Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
L120664 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
L120663 +++$+++ u4373 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WEBB +++$+++ Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.
L120662 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here.
L120661 +++$+++ u4373 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WEBB +++$+++ Uh, I come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. See, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town. He's got lots of friends here. Now, his family and their money go back many, many years. Now, friends vote... family and money votes. That's important to me... and you. And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines...  and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired.
L120657 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ No, that's quite all right.
L120656 +++$+++ u4373 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WEBB +++$+++ Hey, house is doin' well.  Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.
L120655 +++$+++ u4373 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WEBB +++$+++ Oh, thank you, sir.
L120654 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
L120653 +++$+++ u4373 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WEBB +++$+++ Hey, it is my pleasure.
L120652 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ How do you do?
L120651 +++$+++ u4373 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WEBB +++$+++ Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.
L119632 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Seven o'clock.
L119631 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Seven o'clock?
L119630 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'll come by.
L119629 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Okay. You come by the house?
L119628 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
L119627 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
L119626 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Well, that's why they paid so well.
L119625 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it?
L121526 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -
L121525 +++$+++ u4353 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Hello.
L121120 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
L121119 +++$+++ u4353 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
L121118 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
L121117 +++$+++ u4353 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis.
L119891 +++$+++ u4353 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Good to meet you.
L119890 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine.
L119863 +++$+++ u4353 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ All right, we're clear.
L119862 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause it turns out Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.
L119861 +++$+++ u4353 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful.
L119860 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it.
L119857 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ And they were usually right.
