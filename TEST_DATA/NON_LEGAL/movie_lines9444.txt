L588340 +++$+++ u3156 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ OLD TIM +++$+++ Thanks.
L588339 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Please, sit.
L588338 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Sure.  Come on in.  I was just packing.
L588337 +++$+++ u3156 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ OLD TIM +++$+++ Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
L587638 +++$+++ u3158 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ I'll have to think about this.  I have to get back... I should go...
L587637 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Will you help me, Sandy?
L587634 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy.  But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help.
L587633 +++$+++ u3158 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ You mean, he was... let go, too?
L587632 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
L587631 +++$+++ u3158 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
L587630 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
L587629 +++$+++ u3158 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ That you got let go.
L587628 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ What exactly did you hear?
L587627 +++$+++ u3158 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ What happened?
L587574 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ You bet, honey.
L587573 +++$+++ u3158 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Pete, there's time before the picture starts, you want to get some popcorn?
L587731 +++$+++ u3160 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ STANTON +++$+++ Don't mention it.  Whoever-you-are.
L587730 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
L587729 +++$+++ u3160 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ STANTON +++$+++ Said as much myself, Doc.  Can't place him, though.  To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker.  Well, morning's half-over.  I'm off.
L587700 +++$+++ u3160 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ STANTON +++$+++ Got any money?
L587699 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Yes.  Very.
L587698 +++$+++ u3160 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ STANTON +++$+++ You hungry, son?
L587696 +++$+++ u3160 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ STANTON +++$+++ Mabel over there at the diner lost her husband Max.  Okinawa, I believe.
L587695 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ The war...
L587694 +++$+++ u3160 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ STANTON +++$+++ Ernie Cole here just got himself elected mayor.  Lost both his boys in the war.  Kenny at Anzio and Willie at Normandy.
L587693 +++$+++ u3160 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ STANTON +++$+++ 'Course they all know me.  And I know all them.  Town's got my name, don't it?
L587692 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ They all know you?
L587690 +++$+++ u3160 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ STANTON +++$+++ You look familiar, fella.  What's your name?
L587689 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I suppose.  Thanks.
L587688 +++$+++ u3160 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ STANTON +++$+++ Actually, my grandpap.  But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it?  Here.
L587687 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Ancestors?
L588286 +++$+++ u3159 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ All right.  All right.  We'll see.
L588285 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ No.  Absolutely not.
L588284 +++$+++ u3159 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way.  Sir, are you a communist?
L588282 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ No.  No, not Miss Sinclair.  I'm talking about Adele Lardner.
L588281 +++$+++ u3159 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Would that be Miss Sinclair?
L588280 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ My girlfriend.  If she still is...
L588279 +++$+++ u3159 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Who?
L588278 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I already have.
L588277 +++$+++ u3159 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Now that you remember who you are, were you planning on telling anyone your true identity?
L589057 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably lost his way in the dark.
L589056 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Look.
L589055 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Is anyone there?
L589052 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Then go.
L589051 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Yes.
L589050 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
L589049 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
L589048 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That's up to you.
L589047 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Do you think I should go?
L589045 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ It seems so pointless.  I think I'll go to sleep. This has been a busy day.  My luggage.
L589044 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
L589043 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.  I said I would.
L589039 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
L589038 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ And the second?
L589037 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
L589036 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I did.
L589035 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
L589034 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I'm sorry. Forgive me.
L589033 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You get straight to the point, don't you?
L589032 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
L589031 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
L589030 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I see.
L589029 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
L589028 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
L589027 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ She already has a daughter.
L589026 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
L589025 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
L589024 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
L589023 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
L589022 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I don't understand.
L589021 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Afraid I'd give Mitch.
L589020 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Afraid you'd take Mitch?
L589019 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Because she was afraid.
L589018 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Then why did she object to you?
L589017 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.
L589016 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Then what was it?
L589015 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
L589014 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ And what had you done?
L589013 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
L589012 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
L589011 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ A trifle.
L589010 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
L589009 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Different?
L589008 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
L589007 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ When was this?
L589006 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
L589005 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L589004 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
L589003 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
L589002 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
L589001 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I suspected as much.
L589000 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I guess you knew that, anyway.
L588998 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago.
L588997 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ How'd you happen to come here?
L588996 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ San Francisco.
L588995 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Where are you from originally, Annie?
L588994 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
L588993 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I despise it.
L588992 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ How do you like our little hamlet?
L588991 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I think so.
L588990 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Or would you rather I changed the subject?
L588987 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
L588986 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Thank you.
L588985 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ All right. 
L588984 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ No, thank you.  Won't you call me Melanie?
L588983 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels. Do you want a sweater or something? A quilt?
L588982 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ If you have some, I'd...
L588981 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Would you like some brandy?
L588980 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
L588979 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
L588978 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Yes.
L588977 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Miss Daniels? Is that you?
L588847 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yes, I know. Did something unexpected crop up?
L588846 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
L588845 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.
L588844 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
L588843 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
L588842 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
L588841 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
L588840 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yes?
L588839 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I was wondering...
L588838 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Yes, I did.
L588837 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, hi!  Did you find her all right?
L588736 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Thank you.
L588735 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
L588734 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Lovebirds.
L588733 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Do I?  No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.  Or maybe a closed one.  Pretty. What are they?
L588731 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I guess that's where everyone meets him.
L588730 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Yes.
L588729 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
L588728 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Yes.
L588727 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Did you drive up from San Francisco?
L588724 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Actually, it's none of my business.
L588723 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
L588722 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You're leaving after you see Cathy?
L588721 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ No. Just a few hours.
L588720 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
L588719 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ It's a lovely garden.
L588718 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
L588717 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ No, not really.
L588716 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Are you a friend of Mitch's?
L588714 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Which is why the mail in this town never gets delivered to the right place.  Did you want to see Cathy about something?
L588713 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
L588712 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
L588711 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
L588710 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Cathy?
L588709 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
L588708 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yes?
L588707 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to bother you, but...
L588706 +++$+++ u3162 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yes?
L588705 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Miss Hayworth?
L589639 +++$+++ u3168 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Take them.
L589638 +++$+++ u3163 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ They haven't harmed anyone.
L589570 +++$+++ u3168 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ They're birds!
L589569 +++$+++ u3163 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ Mom, they're in a cage!
L589568 +++$+++ u3168 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ No!
L589567 +++$+++ u3163 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?
L589555 +++$+++ u3168 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ If your father were here...
L589554 +++$+++ u3163 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ Mother!
L589130 +++$+++ u3163 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ Just listen to them!
L589129 +++$+++ u3168 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Yes, I did.
L588880 +++$+++ u3163 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ Mom, please, I know all the democracy jazz. They're still hoods.  He's got a client now who shot his wife in the head six times. Six times, can you imagine it?  I mean, even twice would be overdoing it, don't you think?
L588879 +++$+++ u3168 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
L588878 +++$+++ u3163 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
L588877 +++$+++ u3168 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Cathy!
L588876 +++$+++ u3163 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
L588871 +++$+++ u3168 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a different brand.  You don't think they're getting sick, do you, Mitch?
L588870 +++$+++ u3163 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
L588869 +++$+++ u3168 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ He got a call from Dan Fawcett a little while ago. His chickens won't eat, either.
L588900 +++$+++ u3163 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ If you do decide to come, don't say I told you about it. It's supposed to be a surprise party.
L588899 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
L588898 +++$+++ u3163 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.
L588897 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I don't know yet.
L588896 +++$+++ u3163 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ Don't you like Bodega Bay?
L588895 +++$+++ u3171 +++$+++ m208 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Darling, of course I do!
