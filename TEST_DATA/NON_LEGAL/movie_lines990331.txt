L528020 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Hold on.
L528018 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Are you trying, damn it?  Just --
L528017 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Missed.
L528016 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
L528015 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Push her, c'mon.
L528014 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Hold on.
L528013 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I can't reach her.
L528007 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ How far away's the sub?
L528006 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
L528005 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ How much time you figure to get to the surface?
L528004 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Shut up and open the door.
L528003 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ We're never gonna make it.
L528002 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Help me lift her.
L528001 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Fine.
L527996 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I could hit her a little harder. More toward the cranium.
L527995 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I don't think so.
L527994 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Did I kill her?
L527823 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Stop what?  What are you -- ?
L527822 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's the squid!  Stop it!
L527821 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You know what it is, Harry.
L527820 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What is it?
L527771 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag?
L527770 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ That's right.
L527769 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ The three of us.
L527768 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this.
L527754 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Don't have to.  Watch.  It'll do it for you.
L527753 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ How do we decode it?
L527752 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
L527751 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Wisconsin?
L527750 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Wisconsin's your answer.
L527686 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ She's lying, Norman.  Just like she lied about fixing your suit.
L527685 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ But why would she -- ?
L527684 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
L527683 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You didn't say that about the food?
L527682 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ She's cracking, Norman.
L527670 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I thought she was with you.
L527669 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Beth left?
L527668 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Her suit's gone.
L527667 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
L527666 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ When I woke up, nobody was here.
L527665 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What do you mean?  She's not here?
L527664 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What happened to her?
L527663 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --
L527661 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You're clear.  You see the airlock?
L527660 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
L527659 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Norman, where are you?
L527658 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Harry?
L527657 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ ... you there?  Norman?
L527271 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I don't remember much.  It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it.  Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman.  You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine.  Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others.  It's normal, really, isn't it?  In a crisis.  The stress. The panic.
L527270 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You don't remember that?
L527269 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Did I?
L527268 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
L527267 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
L527266 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
L527265 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
L527264 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Getting anywhere with those?
L527255 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What are they?
L527254 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.
L527243 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ That far in what, Harry?
L527242 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
L527241 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Page 87 of what, Harry?
L527240 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?
L527239 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What is it, Harry?
L527238 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Norman?
L527237 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Then explain it to me.
L527236 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You don't understand about the sphere.
L527235 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
L527234 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
L527233 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You remember opening the door?
L527232 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What are you still doing here?
L527231 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?
L527230 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ It's like...
L527229 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What noise?
L527228 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What is that?  That noise?
L527141 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
L527140 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.
L527139 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Then what, Norman?
L527138 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ No.  I didn't say that.
L527137 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You mean, you think I'm cracking?
L527136 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
L527135 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Am I?
L527134 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.
L527133 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Gimme another explanation.
L527132 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I can't believe that, Harry.
L527131 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone.
L527130 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
L527129 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ So, <u>we know</u>.  We know it went through a black hole.  We saw it.  Norman -- when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we?  It'd go in some report like some big discovery.  So in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole.  <u>But they didn't</u>.  The called it an Unknown Entry Event.
L527128 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ So what?
L527127 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
L527126 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I don't follow you.
L527125 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
L527124 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Not a clue.
L527123 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
L527122 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Don't be so optomistic, Harry.
L527112 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.
L527111 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.
L527099 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human.  If it doesn't look human, it's a reptile or a big insect or something, having human values, human understanding.
L527098 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I mentioned it in my report.  Didn't you read the report?
L527081 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Our present.
L527080 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
L527079 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... <u>sphere</u>.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home.
L527078 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Which one?  Let me get the list out.
L527077 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ This answers one of our questions.
L527070 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Time travel.  A black hole.
L527069 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ To what?
L527068 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Our answer.
L527061 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Whatever I can do to help.
L527060 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Nice work, Norman.
L526964 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Look, would you --
L526963 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ C'mon, Norman.
L526961 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Wait a second, I --
L526960 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ C'mon.
L526959 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ No, why don't --
L526958 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Go ahead.  Ladies first.
L526910 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I'm fine.
L526909 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You sound defensive.
L526908 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I'm not being defensive.
L526907 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Don't be defensive.
L526906 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Fine.  I'm fine.
L526905 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You holding up alright?
L526904 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What?
L526903 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ How are you feeling, Norman?
L527445 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  He'd run screaming "witchcraft".  And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics.
L527444 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.
L527394 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Thank you.
L527393 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Good idea, Ted.
L527388 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ "We are friends".
L527387 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What'd you say?
L527370 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Codes are for <u>hiding</u> information.  So it's making a mistake.  It's making a code without intending to.  I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters...  Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard.  And since we're getting spirals, I imagined the keyboard as a spiral.  So I translated it...
L527369 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ See?  No code.  What'd I say?
L527368 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ ... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
L527351 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
L527350 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it.
L527347 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message.
L527346 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Well, if it's a discharge --
L527253 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Impotent?  I'm not impotent.
L527252 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
L527251 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here.
L527085 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Look closely.  That isn't writing. Those are grooves.
L527084 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Looks like a design, some writing, maybe.  Maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message.
L527049 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Not where.  When.  400 years ago.  From our future.
L527048 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Arrived?  From where?
L527047 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
L527046 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Please.  It must have flown here --
L527045 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Meaning it didn't land in the water.
L527044 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Meaning?
L527043 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
L527039 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
L527038 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ An American spacecraft?  Half a mile long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah, good theory, Harry.
L527035 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Save your breath.  It's not an alien spacecraft.
L527034 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ If it is an alien spacecraft --
L527033 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Do you?
L527032 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
L527031 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ All the facts you need are right in front of you.
L527026 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Unless, this alien spacecraft was -- you know -- somehow presenting itself to Americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable.
L527025 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Think about it.
L527024 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
L527023 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Is it?
L527022 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ But it's impossible.
L527021 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
L527020 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
L527019 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious.
L527016 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ That's right.
L527015 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ English?
L526971 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
L526970 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
L526968 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space.
L526967 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.
L526952 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
L526951 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
L526917 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Just one of Norman's many secrets.
L526916 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What is it, Harry?
L526915 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ She told me what you said, Norman.
L526914 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake.
L526913 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What does Norman already know?
L526912 +++$+++ u7809 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
L526911 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What'd you say to him?
L527608 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ About the time paradox.  How we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive --
L527607 +++$+++ u7810 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NAVY SEAMAN +++$+++ What was that, sir?
