L359265 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
L359264 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
L359259 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Lucky.
L359258 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ One, up.
L359420 +++$+++ u6414 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ SHAWNEE +++$+++ I don't wanna look fast.  Thanks, girl.
L359419 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Give it yourself.
L359418 +++$+++ u6414 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ SHAWNEE +++$+++ Well, can you give him this for me?
L359417 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ There's so many I just can't keep track.
L359416 +++$+++ u6414 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ SHAWNEE +++$+++ C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
L359415 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ No.
L359414 +++$+++ u6414 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ SHAWNEE +++$+++ Your hair looks so cute like that.
L359413 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Hey.
L359412 +++$+++ u6414 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ SHAWNEE +++$+++ Hey, girl.
L360000 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
L359999 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?
L359998 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ He tore his ACL.
L359997 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ Nona, please.
L359996 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ The doctor'll be back in a minute.
L359995 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ What's that, not great?
L359994 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ Not great.
L359505 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ Keep your voice down.
L359504 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ Fine, then how many nights home is that?
L359503 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ No, you said I should get my degree.  I like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold.
L359502 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ You said you'd think about going back to get your degree.
L359501 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ I have.
L359500 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...
L359499 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ Yeah.
L359498 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
L359497 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
L359496 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ At one in the morning?
L359495 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ I had some players to see and hands to shake.
L359291 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ Nona, don't start bitching.  I got maybe two years left to play.  I'm just trying to put some things together for us.
L359290 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ You just got back from a four game road trip.
L359289 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ Business folks.
L359288 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ With who?
L359287 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
L359286 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ We should head over.
L359285 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."
L359284 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ Zeke.
L359767 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.
L359766 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ Guess I should have been telling your father.
L359765 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
L359764 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ Quincy, please...
L359763 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ This is just about money, you know that.
L359762 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ Just...leave it alone.
L359761 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family.
L359760 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ Whose truth are you talking about?
L359759 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later the truth'll come out.
L359758 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ Guess he talked to you.
L359756 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ I'm fine.
L359755 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Sorry.  You okay?
L359754 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ You scared me.
L359494 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ I don't know, he had a meeting or something.
L359493 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ Later when?
L359492 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Said he'd be home later.
L359491 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ Where's your dad?
L359490 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Yup.
L359489 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ Still the man.
L359488 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
L359487 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ How was your game?
L359486 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ I've been hearing you.
L359485 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ You hearing me?
L359484 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Okay.
L359483 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
L359482 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ We were just studying.
L359481 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.
L359480 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ What are you doing in my room?
L359479 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ I look like some hoochie to you?  I found it on your floor.
L359478 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Uh, your earring?
L359477 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ What is this?
L359295 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ Yeah.
L359294 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ We still have to go?
L359293 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ What?
L360015 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something.
L360014 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Yeah.
L360013 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ You want me to fuck off?
L360012 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?"
L360011 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
L360010 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Good.
L360009 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ No.
L360008 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
L360007 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.
L360006 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Look, I'm busy.
L360005 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
L360004 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ After five years.
L360003 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ Came by to check on you.
L360002 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ What do you want?
L359897 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Always thought "can't" wasn't in a man's vocabulary.
L359896 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
L359895 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ From your mouth.
L359894 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ What?
L359893 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Since we're being honest, guess I should tell you.  I'm dropping out of school and going pro.
L359892 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man.  But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And another twenty that made it past security on your floor.  And the boldest one is standing right at your door.  And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game.  I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have.  But I did it cause I love you.
L359891 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
L359890 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
L359889 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ I ain't a damn liar.
L359888 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
L359887 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ And some things should never fucking happen!
L359886 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
L359885 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Lucky kid.
L359884 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.
L359883 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ We ain't got nothing to talk about.
L359882 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ We need to talk.
L359881 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Still is, so let yourself out.
L359880 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ Your door was unlocked.
L359879 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L359750 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years.  Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart.  We'll just have to see how it plays out.  I'm giving her some space, couple days...
L359749 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ What's Mom think?
L359748 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ A case like this could hang around for months and I'm up for this player relations job with the "Clips."  This gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me.
L359747 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Why?
L359746 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.
L359745 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ So what are you gonna do?
L359744 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.
L359743 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Sorry.
L359741 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ I mean, it's not true, is it?
L359740 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ I just told you.
L359739 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Tell me what?
L359738 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
L359737 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ What?
L359736 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
L359735 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ What mess?
L359734 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.
L359733 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Okay...
L359732 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices.  You don't have a choice.
L359731 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ You came out early.
L359730 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The NBA ain't going nowhere.
L359729 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ I'm also good enough to go pro.
L359728 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree.
L359727 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ You know, people.
L359726 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ What people?
L359436 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ Let's hope I can say the same about you one day.
L359435 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ You work too hard, Pop.
L359434 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.
L359433 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ You don't wanna hurt your back.
L359432 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
L359431 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
L359429 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Didn't we already have this conversation?
L359428 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.
L359427 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way.
L359283 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ That's right.
L359282 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
L359281 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ Why not?
L359280 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ "Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
L359279 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
L361846 +++$+++ u6417 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ AVI +++$+++ HEY FUCK YOU DON WATCH IT NOW.
L361845 +++$+++ u6426 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSSINESS. I HAVE BEEN A GOOD WORKER, A GOOD AND LOYAL WORKER FOR YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.
L361844 +++$+++ u6417 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ AVI +++$+++ No need for braces, Donnie.
L361832 +++$+++ u6426 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I don't know.
L361831 +++$+++ u6417 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ AVI +++$+++ How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?
L361830 +++$+++ u6426 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what?  Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this.
L361829 +++$+++ u6417 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ AVI +++$+++ Don, you got hit by lightning that time in Tahoe, you went on vacation, I don't think braces is a good idea --
L361828 +++$+++ u6426 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I need corrective oral surgery. I need the braces.
L361827 +++$+++ u6417 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ AVI +++$+++ Your teeth are straight.
L361819 +++$+++ u6426 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Oral surgery.  Corrective teeth surgery.
L361818 +++$+++ u6417 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ AVI +++$+++ What surery?

L362560 +++$+++ u6418 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ BURT +++$+++ no, no, c'mon Jimmy we need to call this quits and you need to see a doctor.

L362195 +++$+++ u6435 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
L362194 +++$+++ u6418 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ BURT +++$+++ You okay?  huh?  Jimmy?
L362105 +++$+++ u6418 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ BURT +++$+++ These adults are tough enough, I think you'll be surprised -- the Mexican's a bit of a question mark --
L362104 +++$+++ u6435 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ It's been the same fuckin' thing for thirty years, Burt --
L362103 +++$+++ u6435 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ ooohhhhhh no.

L362286 +++$+++ u6443 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
L362285 +++$+++ u6419 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CHAD +++$+++ Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.
