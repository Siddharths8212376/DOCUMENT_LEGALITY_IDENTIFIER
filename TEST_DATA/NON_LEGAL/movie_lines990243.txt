L476143 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ What do you mean?  Look.  We can make still make it work.
L476142 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
L476141 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now!
L476140 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ He killed her...
L476139 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Booth, listen to me...Booth!
L476138 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
L476137 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
L476136 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ He killed her...he killed her...
L476135 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Oh Jesus...
L476100 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ Then Sally comes too.
L476099 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ That's right.
L476098 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ We've got to go now, then.
L476097 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.
L476096 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ We're not?  How do you figure that?
L476095 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ No we're not.
L476094 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ Then we're screwed.
L476093 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
L476092 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
L476091 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
L476006 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ I sure as hell hope so.  Let's go.
L476005 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Do you have everything?
L476004 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
L476003 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ Maybe we should say somethin'.
L475999 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Yes I DO!  It never woulda stopped, you know that.  Jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives.
L475998 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ You don't know if he was really gonna --
L475997 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
L475996 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...
L475989 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!
L475988 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ It's gonna be o.k.
L475987 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ You killed him...
L475986 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
L475980 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ There it is...now what about the others?
L475979 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ Here it is.
L475977 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ I'm just making our intentions clear. Go check the desk.
L475976 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ What are you thinking?  We were only supposed to scare him!
L475958 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
L475957 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ How long is it going to take?!
L475889 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...
L475888 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ Not bad enough to kill him.
L475887 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
L475886 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ You're crazy.
L475884 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
L475883 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ Well what are we supposed to do?
L475882 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
L475881 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
L475880 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
L475879 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ Look, Earl.  We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...
L475878 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Neither do I.
L475877 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ No.
L475876 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ You think he's bluffing?
L475870 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
L475869 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ You're out of your mind.
L475718 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Well I mean it this time.  Come on.  Let's get this over with!
L475717 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ You said that last time!
L475716 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
L475715 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ We had a deal!  What was I, talking to the wall?
L475712 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
L475711 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ He's going to be trouble.
L475710 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Forget the copies!  He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
L475709 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
L475708 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
L475707 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ And how do you figure we do that?
L475706 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ I've got a better idea.  All we have to do is straighten out Jesse.
L475705 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ ...Or get rid of the money.  I don't know.
L475704 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
L475703 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
L475702 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
L475701 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
L475629 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Exactly.  This is our little secret, partner.
L475628 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ He would have done it to us, right?
L475627 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
L475626 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ That's not what I mean.
L475625 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Okay then.  I'll do it.
L475624 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ I can't do that.
L475623 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
L475622 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one.
L475621 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ I don't know...
L475620 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ What are you thinking?
L475619 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
L475616 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
L475615 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
L475564 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Man take it easy!  You're sweating like crazy!
L475563 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ I should have known something like this was going to happen!
L475562 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
L475561 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ It's the right thing to do.
L475560 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
L475559 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
L475558 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ Oh, right, with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl.  I'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape...
L475557 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ No we didn't.  He died on his own.
L475556 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
L475555 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Well, we didn't know that at the time.
L475554 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.
L475553 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?!  We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...
L475552 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ This isn't a joke. What are we going to do!
L475551 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ I don't know...
L475550 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ We're dead.  We're dead, We are dead...  What are we going to do?!
L475495 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ Forget it.  We're going to bury it, and we're not going to even think about it until everything dies down.  And no one, I mean no one hears a word about it.	 Understand?
L475494 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
L475493 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ Look.  Dwayne was right.  This is going to be a big story.  So big in fact that I don't want to even have this money around.
L475492 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Well we didn't kill him, he died on his own.
L475491 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that!  We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
L475490 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ I tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out --
L475451 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
L475450 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ That's not what I mean.
L475449 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Okay then.  I'll do it.
L475448 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ I...I can't do that.
L475447 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
L475446 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
L475445 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ I don't know...
L475444 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ What are you thinking?
L475443 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail.  We can't risk it.
L475438 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
L475437 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
L475436 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ He saw everything!
L475435 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ I don't know!  Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?
L475430 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ Well, I don't know.  I'm putting it out of my mind and you should too --
L475429 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ What are you gonna do?
L475428 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ Shhh!
L475414 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Well, we won't do any of that shit!
L475413 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions.
L475412 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ What's that?
L475411 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ I've got one condition.
L475408 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ I don't know.
L475407 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ We'll leave a few packets in the trunk, and stash the rest somewhere else.  Car went up in the gunfight.
L475406 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ Torch it?!
L475405 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ We'll torch the bases, how's that?
L475403 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ All right we will.
L475402 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ I do.  It's little shit like that sends people to jail! We have to cover all the bases if we're going to pull this!
L475401 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Maybe.  Who cares?
L475400 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ All right hold on!  Lemme think...  Shit, did you touch the car?
L475398 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ They killed themselves.  Besides, they were breaking the law.  What they were doing was wrong!  Whatsamatter Booth, don't you believe in miracles?
L475397 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ At the expense of six people.
L475396 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ That's right!
L475395 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
L475394 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true.
L475393 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Because...I know.
L475392 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ What makes you so sure?
L475391 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
L475390 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
L475389 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
L475388 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
L475387 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus!
L475385 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ We'll figure something out.
L475384 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
L475383 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Why?
L475382 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ It won't work.
L475381 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Hell, it won't be us!
L475380 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ Well someone's gonna find them.
L475379 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
L475378 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ We don't know that.
L475377 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
L475376 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
L475375 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
L475374 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ No.  We can't.
L475373 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Why?  Are you kidding me?
L475372 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ Call it in I guess.  Why?
L475370 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ I mean -- Earl grabs Booth's arm --
L475369 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ What do you mean what are we going to do?
L475368 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ What are we going to do?
L475364 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ Shit, more than that.
L475363 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ There must be over a million dollars in here.
L475362 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ Ten thousand right here.
L475357 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ They're out of towners... Arizona plates...
L475356 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ What the hell...
L475351 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ That's what everyone thinks.  But according to him, when it's the real thing, it's quite an intimidatin' environment in which to concentrate.
L475350 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ I probably would have.  I guess the clues damn near before everyone.
L475349 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Oh, you would have done great.
L475348 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ Never heard of it.
L475347 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
L475346 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ Cash and what?
L475345 +++$+++ u7328 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.
L475344 +++$+++ u7324 +++$+++ m495 +++$+++ BOOTH +++$+++ Seven thousand...
