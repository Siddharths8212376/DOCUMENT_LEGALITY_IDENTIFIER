L370682 +++$+++ u2014 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ SECOND IRISH WOMAN +++$+++ Oh, that's a sad story.
L370681 +++$+++ u2006 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ FIRST IRISH WOMAN +++$+++ That's the one.
L370680 +++$+++ u2014 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ SECOND IRISH WOMAN +++$+++ Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves.
L370679 +++$+++ u2006 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ FIRST IRISH WOMAN +++$+++ Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...
L370678 +++$+++ u2014 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ SECOND IRISH WOMAN +++$+++ Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was wrong, wasn't he?
L370668 +++$+++ u2006 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ FIRST IRISH WOMAN +++$+++ Well, I bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel.
L370667 +++$+++ u2014 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ SECOND IRISH WOMAN +++$+++ And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?
L370664 +++$+++ u2006 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ FIRST IRISH WOMAN +++$+++ Well, at the time she told me this, she already had six. Every time I saw the woman, she was either...
L370663 +++$+++ u2014 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ SECOND IRISH WOMAN +++$+++ She was always a bit thin in the hips...
L370951 +++$+++ u2008 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ About eight o'clock.
L370950 +++$+++ u2009 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ What time is it?
L370933 +++$+++ u2008 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I never thoughta that.
L370932 +++$+++ u2009 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
L370931 +++$+++ u2008 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll.
L370915 +++$+++ u2009 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure can write.
L370914 +++$+++ u2008 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What I like about Mickey Spillane is he knows how to handle women. In one book, he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car, and she throws a pass at him. And then he meets two beautiful twins, and they throw passes at him. And then he meets some beautiful society leader, and she throws a pass at him, and...
L370911 +++$+++ u2009 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he can write.
L370910 +++$+++ u2008 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ ...so the whole book winds up, Mike Hammer, he's inna room there with this doll. So he says, "You rat, you are the murderer." So she begins to con him, you know? She tells him how she loves him. And then Bam! He shoots her in the stomach. So she's laying there, gasping for breath, and she says, "How could you do that?" And he says, "It was easy."
L370863 +++$+++ u2015 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ What girl, what does she know?  Why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! Your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!
L370862 +++$+++ u2010 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Sure. This girl said...
L370861 +++$+++ u2015 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
L370860 +++$+++ u2010 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Well, I understand the problem about the supermarkets, but I was talking to this girl last night, and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset.
L370858 +++$+++ u2015 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Who buys Italian meat anymore? You think my wife buys Italian meat?  She goes to the A&P, picks up some lamb chops wrapped in cellophane, opens up a canna peas, and that's dinner, boy.
L370857 +++$+++ u2010 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Well, you see, Thomas I figure the big problem is the supermarkets. But Patsy's shop, that's a specialized trade. The supermarkets don't carry Italian meat.
L370856 +++$+++ u2015 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Wadda you wanna buy a shop for, will you tell me? You gotta good job, you got no wife, you got no responsibilities. Boy, I wish I was you, boy. Waddaya wanna tie yourself down with a shop? What's he want? Five thousand down? You're gonna have to carry a mortgage sixty, seventy bucks a month. A mortgage anna note from the bank. For Pete's sake, you're a single man with no responsibilities. Stay that way, boy. Take my advice.
L370854 +++$+++ u2010 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ No, I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.
L370853 +++$+++ u2015 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
L370852 +++$+++ u2010 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him know tomorrow. See, what I wanna know, Tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it operate? On individual mark- ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's the dairyman and grocer, so suppose I mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so...
L370838 +++$+++ u2015 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Sure, great if you ain't married.
L370837 +++$+++ u2010 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
L370447 +++$+++ u2015 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ No, listen, that's my mother, I'm gonna pay for her...
L370446 +++$+++ u2010 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Don't worry about it.
L370445 +++$+++ u2015 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Sure. Thanks a lot about my mother. We'll work out some arrangement, because naturally I want to pay...
L370444 +++$+++ u2010 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ All right, I'll see you, Thomas, because he wants an answer by Monday.
L370441 +++$+++ u2010 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ You're the accountant inna family, and I figure you might know about these things. My boss wantsa sell his shop to me. His kids are all married, you know, and he and his wife live alone, and they wanna move out to California where his daughter lives, so he wantsa sell his shop. He wants five thousand dollars down, although I think I can knock him downa four...
L370440 +++$+++ u2015 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Sure, what?
L370439 +++$+++ u2010 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a little advice.
L370948 +++$+++ u2010 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I think I'll just hang arounna house and watch...
L370947 +++$+++ u2012 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MRS. PILLETTI +++$+++ So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?

L370893 +++$+++ u2012 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MRS. PILLETTI +++$+++ She didn't look Italian to me.
L370892 +++$+++ u2010 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
L370890 +++$+++ u2010 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ I don't know. I don't think so.

L370466 +++$+++ u2010 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.

L370328 +++$+++ u2011 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MRS. FUSARI +++$+++ When you gonna get married, Marty? You should be ashamed of yourself. All your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children. I just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, "Hey, you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter with you? That's no way. Now you get married.
L370325 +++$+++ u2011 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MRS. FUSARI +++$+++ Well...
L370324 +++$+++ u2010 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ No, that's my sister Margaret's husband, Frank. My sister Margaret, she's married to the insurance salesman, and my sister Rose, she married a contractor. They moved to Detroit last year. And my other sister Frances, she got married about two and a half years ago in Saint John's Church on Kingsbridge Avenue. Oh, that was a big affair. Well, let's see now, that'll be about a dollar- seventy-nine. How's that with you?
L370323 +++$+++ u2011 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MRS. FUSARI +++$+++ I thought he was a big tall fat fellow. Didn't I meet him here one time? Big tall, fat fellow, he tried to sell me life insurance?
L370322 +++$+++ u2010 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
L370321 +++$+++ u2011 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MRS. FUSARI +++$+++ That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
L370320 +++$+++ u2010 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
L370319 +++$+++ u2011 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MRS. FUSARI +++$+++ Your kid brother got married last Sunday, eh, Marty?
L370830 +++$+++ u2015 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Ah, my mother, she drives me crazy. I hadda beg her to let me drive her over here. The martyr. She always gotta be the big martyr.
L370829 +++$+++ u2012 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MRS. PILLETTI +++$+++ Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
L370828 +++$+++ u2015 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Hello, Aunt Theresa.
L370563 +++$+++ u2012 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MRS. PILLETTI +++$+++ Hey, why don't you go to the movie? Your mother and me, we're gonna be baby-sitter.
L370562 +++$+++ u2015 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Ma, you want something to eat, some tuna fish?
L370541 +++$+++ u2012 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MRS. PILLETTI +++$+++ Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
L370540 +++$+++ u2015 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see? And wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see...
L370539 +++$+++ u2015 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ I just this minute got the baby to sleep.
L370538 +++$+++ u2012 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MRS. PILLETTI +++$+++ Hello, Thomas.
L370537 +++$+++ u2015 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Hello, Aunt Theresa.

L370428 +++$+++ u2015 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a load offa my mind.
L370427 +++$+++ u2012 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MRS. PILLETTI +++$+++ He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here.
L370420 +++$+++ u2015 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Right.
L370419 +++$+++ u2012 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MRS. PILLETTI +++$+++ The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
L370418 +++$+++ u2015 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."
L370417 +++$+++ u2012 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MRS. PILLETTI +++$+++ Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
L370416 +++$+++ u2015 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Oh, he'll get married, don't worry, Aunt Theresa.
L370412 +++$+++ u2012 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MRS. PILLETTI +++$+++ You just sit here, I gotta turn the fire on under the cooking. 
L370411 +++$+++ u2015 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Sure.
L370410 +++$+++ u2012 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MRS. PILLETTI +++$+++ We gotta ask Marty, of course.
L370409 +++$+++ u2015 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
L370408 +++$+++ u2012 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MRS. PILLETTI +++$+++ She's right. She's right. Young husband and wife, they should have their own home. And my sister Catherine, she's my sister, but I gotta admit, she's an old goat. And plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. And I tell you now, as far as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty, it's all right with me.
L370407 +++$+++ u2015 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ All right, Ginnie, don't get so excited.
L370565 +++$+++ u2012 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MRS. PILLETTI +++$+++ Sure, sure.
L370564 +++$+++ u2016 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.
L370536 +++$+++ u2012 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MRS. PILLETTI +++$+++ I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
L370535 +++$+++ u2016 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you?
L370436 +++$+++ u2012 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MRS. PILLETTI +++$+++ I'm gonna see you tonight...
L370435 +++$+++ u2016 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ On accounta...

L370406 +++$+++ u2016 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ I just can't stand it any more! Every minute of the day! Do this! Do that! I don't have ten minutes privacy with my husband! We can't even have a fight! We don't have no privacy! Everybody's miserable in our house!
L370405 +++$+++ u2012 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MRS. PILLETTI +++$+++ No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
L370404 +++$+++ u2016 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
L370403 +++$+++ u2012 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MRS. PILLETTI +++$+++ Well...
L370402 +++$+++ u2016 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here. I mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty. And I thought maybe Tommy's mother could come here and live with you and Marty.
L370401 +++$+++ u2012 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MRS. PILLETTI +++$+++ Sure.
L370396 +++$+++ u2012 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MRS. PILLETTI +++$+++ Well, I don't know what you want me to do, Virginia. If you want me, I'll go talk to her tonight.
L370395 +++$+++ u2016 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ So she say, "You're spilling the milk." So she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk I spilled, so she got me so mad, so I said, "Mama, you wanna see me really spill some milk?" So I took the bottle, and I threw it against the door. I didn't throw it at her. That's just something she made up. She goes around telling everybody I threw the bottla milk at her. I didn't throw it anywheres near her. Well, I was sorry right away, you know, but she ran outta the house.
L370394 +++$+++ u2012 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MRS. PILLETTI +++$+++ She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."
L370393 +++$+++ u2016 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
