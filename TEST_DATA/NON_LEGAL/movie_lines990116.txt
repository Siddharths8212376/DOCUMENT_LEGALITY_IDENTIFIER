L375793 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Death!
L375792 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Yes.
L375790 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ '...Yes --'
L375789 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You are --?
L375788 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You're coming to 'take me'.  What is that?  Who the hell are you?
L375787 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ I am not a dream.
L375786 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream?
L375783 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Yes, Bill.  The question.
L375782 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ The 'question' --
L375781 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
L375780 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What question?
L375779 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ 'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.
L375778 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Yes what?
L375777 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
L375776 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I'm sorry --
L375775 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Watch it!
L375774 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What the hell are you talking about?
L375773 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Time.
L375772 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Get what?
L375771 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
L375770 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ 'The one' to do what?
L375769 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.
L375768 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ 'Take me'...?  Where?
L375767 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ I want to have a look around before I take you.
L375766 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ About what?
L375765 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Just think of millenniums multiplied by aeons compounded by infinity, I've been around that long, but it's only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest.  Call it boredom, the natural curiosity of me, the most lasting and significant element in existence has come to see you.
L375764 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What the hell is this?  Who are you?
L375763 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words?  The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --
L375761 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Quiet.
L375760 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What is this, a joke, right?  Some kind of elaborate practical joke? At my 40th reunion, we delivered a casket to the Class president's hotel room and --
L375759 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ I'm here.
L375758 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Where are you?
L375701 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Know what?  Know what, goddammit!
L375700 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ I think you know --
L375699 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What do you mean?!
L375698 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ There's going to be plenty of time for that.
L375697 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Please.  Talk to me --
L375696 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ It's enough now.
L375695 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Where are you?  Are you there?
L375694 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ No, you're not.  You're trying to 'handle' the situation but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle.
L375693 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I'm sorry, I --
L375692 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Are you giving me orders?
L375690 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ What you were talking about.
L375689 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L375688 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Try.  Because 'if you haven't tried, you haven't lived'.
L375687 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I don't!
L375686 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ I think you know --
L375684 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ I believe you did.
L375683 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I didn't ask any question.
L375682 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ 'Yes' is the answer to your question.
L375681 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ 'Yes' what?
L375611 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What?
L375610 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ '...I know, it's none of my business.'
L376684 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Sir, I'll deliver the package.
L376683 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Quince, I've got confidence in you.
L376682 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ You think Drew will go for it?
L376681 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.
L376676 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Yes, I believe I do.
L376675 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?
L376674 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Sure.
L376673 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?
L376671 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ It's okay, Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
L376670 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ ...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --
L376366 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ The vodka.  What'd I tell you?
L376365 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ This one.
L376361 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ See.  There.  What'd I tell you?
L376360 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Yeah, I give a shit.
L376359 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?
L376357 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
L376356 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka --  Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.
L376189 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Joe, you don't know how glad I am you're aboard.  Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, I'm in his corner.
L376188 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ No, anything is possible.  It's up to Joe.
L376187 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Yeah.  Or the week after.
L376186 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Next week?
L376185 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week.
L376184 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Thank you, Quince.
L376183 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ ...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.
L375564 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Bontecou Day.  Going to close with Big John -- Look at you, Bill, all cool as a cat and over at Bontecou's, I'll bet he's shitting in his pants.
L375563 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ How's that, Quince?
L375562 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ I am, this is it.  B Day.
L375561 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I'm doing great.  You ready?
L375560 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ How're you doing--?
L375559 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Good morning, Quince.
L375558 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Hi, Bill --
L376793 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ But we want you back, Bill.  Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.
L376792 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than I bargained for.  I just wanted to set the record straight.
L376756 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ We're all ears.
L376755 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.
L376754 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ We're all here, Bill --
L376599 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Okay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for the memory.
L376598 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?
L376597 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.
L376596 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
L376595 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
L376594 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope.
L376593 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?
L376592 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
L376591 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Eddie?
L376461 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ I'm going to stick it out here.  We still have a shot.
L376460 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
L376459 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
L376458 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
L376457 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ ...It's not over, 'til it's over.
L376061 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?
L376060 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?
L376823 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ The fireworks are about to start.
L376822 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What was that?
L376817 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
L376816 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
L376815 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Oh, yes --
L376814 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I'm still here.  Would you like to dance with me, Susan?
L376810 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ That's why it's okay.
L376809 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I love you, Daddy --
L376808 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something.  I don't want you to ever worry about me.  If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.  -- And I have no regrets.
L376807 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Daddy --
L376806 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
L376805 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ But what?
L376804 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Yes, but --
L376803 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Are you relieved?
L376802 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L376801 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --
L376800 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I'm having a helluva time.
L376799 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ What a night.
L376574 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
L376573 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I love him.
L376572 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ In this case, I can't.  I - uh -- I just can't help you.  I only would tell you -- that with Joe, you are on very, very dangerous ground.
L376571 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
L376570 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I don't know, I can't say --
L376569 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Where's he going?
L376568 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.
L376567 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ What are you afraid of, Dad?  That I'll fall head over heels for Joe -- well, I have -- as you did with Mom.  That's always been standard, whether you like or not.
L376566 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You don't know anything about Joe --
L376565 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
L376564 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ This is crazy --
L376563 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Love.  Passion.  Obsession, all those things you told me to wait for.  Well, they've arrived.
L376562 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I don't understand.
L376561 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.
L376560 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I don't know.
L376559 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Where is he?
L376558 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Joe?
L376557 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Where's Joe?
L376329 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ It's something.
L376328 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Then what is it?
L376327 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
L376326 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Nothing.
L376325 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
L376324 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
L376323 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Then what will you say?
L376322 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --
L376321 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Well, remember how you told me about "lightning striking"?  The nature of it's in there somewhere.
L376320 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
L376319 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Raise away.
L376318 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
L376317 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Yeah, it's good to get together.
L376316 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ That was wonderful.
L376239 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Will it?...
L376238 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ It'll come back, Daddy.
L375888 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.
L375887 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
L375877 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
L375876 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
L375866 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ -- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.
L375865 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What?!
L375864 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ We've met.
L375863 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You know each other?
L375625 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Yer damn right.
L375624 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Well, go get 'em, Pops.
L375623 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.
L375622 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Are you okay?
L375620 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Nothing.
L375619 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ What is it, Daddy --?
L375617 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Nothing.  I'm sorry.
L375616 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Daddy, what's the matter?
L375606 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.
L375605 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Thank God.
L375604 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.
L375603 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You're terrible.
L375602 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.
L375601 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.
L375600 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Stay open.  Who knows?  Lightning could strike.
L375599 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
L375598 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Aw, you're tough.
L375597 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Bravo.
L375596 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.
L375595 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ 'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
L375594 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
L375593 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ That's all?
L375592 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
L375591 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Don't get dirty, Dad --
L375590 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
L375589 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You're not listening --
L375588 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
L375587 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ So what's wrong with that?
L375586 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
L375585 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ What were you going to say?
L375584 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Well, I wasn't going to say that --
L375583 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
L375582 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
L375581 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Uh oh --
L375580 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Don't get carried away.
