L366430 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.
L366429 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
L366428 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
L366427 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ No.
L366426 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
L366425 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
L366424 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ How are you getting along with Pinta?
L366423 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ It insults Maria. Slip it to the dog if you have to... Do you mind if I talk to you for a moment?
L366422 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
L366421 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
L366420 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ I'm fine.
L366419 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need.
L366310 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Never.
L366309 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ You've done much of this work before?
L366304 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ So are you.
L366303 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ You're American.
L366302 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
L366301 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ The world of our children. How dare they?
L366871 +++$+++ u1995 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ ROSANNA +++$+++ Camila. Camila Valencias.
L366870 +++$+++ u1984 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY'S VOICE +++$+++ What was her name?
L366869 +++$+++ u1995 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ ROSANNA +++$+++ Last night. Do you know something?
L366868 +++$+++ u1984 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY'S VOICE +++$+++ Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
L366867 +++$+++ u1995 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ ROSANNA +++$+++ Where are you?
L366866 +++$+++ u1984 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY'S VOICE +++$+++ It's Creasy.
L366865 +++$+++ u1995 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ ROSANNA +++$+++ Rosanna Guerrero.
L366221 +++$+++ u1988 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ She understands men.
L366220 +++$+++ u1996 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ For an American she understands this country very well.
L366219 +++$+++ u1988 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Her beauty fucks with your mind.
L366218 +++$+++ u1996 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
L366217 +++$+++ u1988 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ For a few months. Hire someone cheap. You have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance. Then fire him for incompetence. The important thing is Lisa's daughter will return to school.
L366216 +++$+++ u1996 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ For a year?
L366215 +++$+++ u1988 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ You need a bodyguard of some description. It's a dangerous world we live in. But you will get what you pay for. He doesn't need to be Superman, does he? Can you go fifteen grand?
L366214 +++$+++ u1996 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ I know! I just had to let one go because I couldn't afford him!
L366213 +++$+++ u1988 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
L366212 +++$+++ u1996 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.
L366211 +++$+++ u1988 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ All my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.
L366210 +++$+++ u1988 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Yeah? And if she was ugly?
L366209 +++$+++ u1996 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
L366201 +++$+++ u1996 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ Do you know what she told me last night?
L366200 +++$+++ u1988 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ If she pisses you off, you get another one.
L366199 +++$+++ u1996 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
L366198 +++$+++ u1988 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
L366707 +++$+++ u1999 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ [OK. You will arrive at Columbus Circle and Reforma Avenue at 3AM. You will drive around the square two times. Samuel will remove his shirt and hold it out the window to I.D. the car.]
L366706 +++$+++ u1988 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ [He has a heart condition. Angina. He responds badly to stress.]
L366705 +++$+++ u1999 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ [No. Why?]
L366704 +++$+++ u1988 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ [I need a driver to drive Samuel, the father.]
L366703 +++$+++ u1999 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ [The car will not be powerful and have no trunk.]
L366702 +++$+++ u1988 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ [The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
L366701 +++$+++ u1999 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ [OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
L366700 +++$+++ u1988 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ [Yes.]
L366699 +++$+++ u1999 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ [You have the money.]
L366485 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.
L366484 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
L366454 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Don't forget your towel.
L366453 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Bye, Mom.
L366346 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
L366345 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.
L366343 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ He's like a great big bear.  'Creasy bear'...
L366342 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ You do?
L366341 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ I like him, Mom.
L366318 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ This is Mr. Creasy.
L366317 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Yes, mom?
L366266 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
L366265 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English.
L366264 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going back.
L366263 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ When?
L366262 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Good news. You're going back to school.
L366261 +++$+++ u1992 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ PINTA +++$+++ I'm trying, mom.
L366260 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ You should be sleeping, baby.
L366631 +++$+++ u1996 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ I wasn't thinking of Pinta.
L366630 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ She's young. She'll get over it.
L366629 +++$+++ u1996 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ It will be a hard break.
L366626 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ He has to go.
L366625 +++$+++ u1996 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ I've just been so busy, Lisa.
L366624 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ It's not.
L366623 +++$+++ u1996 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ That's ridiculous.
L366622 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
L366621 +++$+++ u1996 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ Why? You were so pleased with him.
L366620 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Creasy.
L366619 +++$+++ u1996 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ What? Who?
L366618 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ He has to go, Samuel.
L366352 +++$+++ u1996 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
L366351 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Creasy. Pinta likes him.
L366350 +++$+++ u1996 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ Hmm?
L366349 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ She likes him.
L366323 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ You realize that you've brought a killer into the house.
L366322 +++$+++ u1996 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ I think it's fantastic.
L366321 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I think it's nice he's American.
L366312 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
L366311 +++$+++ u1996 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.
L366306 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
L366305 +++$+++ u1996 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ My wife, Mr. Creasy.
L366208 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Samuel, it is not something we should skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I feel totally exposed.
L366207 +++$+++ u1996 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
L366206 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Our child's safety is at stake.
L366205 +++$+++ u1996 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ Our daughter.
L366204 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
L366203 +++$+++ u1996 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
L366202 +++$+++ u1990 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.
L366986 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ [He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.]
L366985 +++$+++ u1995 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ ROSANNA +++$+++ [Who's that?]
L366926 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ [I should start going for your tits first.]
L366925 +++$+++ u1995 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ ROSANNA +++$+++ [And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
L366923 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ [A beautiful circle.]
L366922 +++$+++ u1995 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ ROSANNA +++$+++ [You only give information so you can fuck me.]
L366921 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ [You only fuck me to get information.]
L366920 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ [I think he's... magnificent.]
L366919 +++$+++ u1995 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ ROSANNA +++$+++ [No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
L366918 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ [When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
L366917 +++$+++ u1995 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ ROSANNA +++$+++ [And left three more dead men.]
L366916 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ [Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday.]
L366794 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ [It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]
L366793 +++$+++ u1995 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ ROSANNA +++$+++ [Then what do you have to lose?]
L366792 +++$+++ u1995 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ ROSANNA +++$+++ [Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.]
L366791 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ [I know this. Your point?]
L366788 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ [We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.]
L366787 +++$+++ u1995 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ ROSANNA +++$+++ [Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
L366786 +++$+++ u1995 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ ROSANNA +++$+++ [He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]
L366785 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ [He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
L366675 +++$+++ u1995 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ ROSANNA +++$+++ [That's good. Really good. He shot and killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper died in the attack. They're saying he's responsible.]
L366674 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ [Is that good or bad?]
L366673 +++$+++ u1995 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ ROSANNA +++$+++ [A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old. The bodyguard's American. Not only that he's black.]
L366914 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ A man can be an artist in anything. Stone, paint, words. Food. Anything if his soul is true to it. Creasy's art is death. And he's about to paint his masterpiece.
L366913 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ And they took that away.
L366912 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.
L366911 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ What was she to Creasy then?
L366910 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
L366909 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
L366908 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
L366907 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
L366906 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.
L366905 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ What happened to him? What happened to Creasy?
L366904 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
L366903 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders.  You two were a married couple.
L366902 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ I can take care of myself.
L366901 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
L366900 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ That's what friends do.
L366899 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ You helped him get this job.
L366898 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ Two tourists who never went home.
L366897 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
L366896 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
L366895 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ Tell me about your friend Creasy.
L366894 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ I already ate.
L366893 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew really.
L366693 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ So am I.
L366692 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
L366691 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
L366690 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ He's not a cop killer.
L370504 +++$+++ u2005 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ DR. KEEGAN +++$+++ Listen. You people go grab a table. I'll be back inna minute. I'll be right back.
L370503 +++$+++ u2000 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
L370502 +++$+++ u2005 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ DR. KEEGAN +++$+++ What?
L370501 +++$+++ u2000 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Hey, Herbie...
L370484 +++$+++ u2005 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ DR. KEEGAN +++$+++ All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
L370483 +++$+++ u2000 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
L370482 +++$+++ u2005 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ DR. KEEGAN +++$+++ You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
L370481 +++$+++ u2000 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I told you she wasn't attractive...
L370480 +++$+++ u2005 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ DR. KEEGAN +++$+++ She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
L370479 +++$+++ u2000 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ ANDY +++$+++ I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl...
L370941 +++$+++ u2001 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ ANGIE +++$+++ I looked all over for you last night, you know that?
L370940 +++$+++ u2010 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Waddaya getting so sore about?
L370939 +++$+++ u2001 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ ANGIE +++$+++ Brush her. Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?
L370938 +++$+++ u2010 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ I told this dog I was gonna call her today about two-thirty.
L370935 +++$+++ u2001 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ ANGIE +++$+++ She musta kept you inna shadows all night.
L370934 +++$+++ u2010 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ I didn't think she was so bad-looking.
L370930 +++$+++ u2001 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ ANGIE +++$+++ Boy, she musta been some talker. She musta been about fifty years old.
L370929 +++$+++ u2010 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ We just talked.
L370928 +++$+++ u2001 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ ANGIE +++$+++ Boy, you really musta made out good last night.
L370927 +++$+++ u2010 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
L370926 +++$+++ u2001 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ ANGIE +++$+++ Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.
L370921 +++$+++ u2001 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ ANGIE +++$+++ You got me mad, that's why. Hey, Joe, show Marty that picture.
L370920 +++$+++ u2010 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
L370919 +++$+++ u2001 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ ANGIE +++$+++ Are you kidding?
