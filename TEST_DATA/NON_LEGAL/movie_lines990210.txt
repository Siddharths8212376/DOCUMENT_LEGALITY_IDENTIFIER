L449709 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ You gotta tell me where she is.
L449708 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?
L449707 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Where's Roach?
L449706 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Good guess.  There's a gun on you right now.
L449705 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ But you're not alone.
L449704 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ I'm not armed.
L449665 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ Wild, ain't it?!  See, we exist on a higher plane, you and I.  We make our own rules.  Why be a servant of the law Johnny U... when you can be it's master?
L449664 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
L449663 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
L449662 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ I can't do this.
L449654 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ See!  That's what I like about you, man!  You're just sharp as a razor blade.
L449653 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ We're wasting time.
L449651 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there.
L449650 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.
L449649 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything.  At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see...  ... six hours from now.
L449648 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Talk.
L449647 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ Whoa, whoa!!  Think it through!  I'm the only one knows where they are. Just let me talk for a second.
L449646 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ You're a fucking dead man--
L449644 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
L449643 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ What's this?
L449639 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ Okay!
L449638 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ You first!
L449637 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
L449636 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ You do it... you first!
L449635 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ Don't screw around man, pull it!
L449634 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ After you, Alfonse.  I insist!
L449633 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ You gonna pull?
L449624 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ I'll take that as a yes.
L449623 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
L449622 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ Utah, you copy bruddah?
L449621 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ My man!
L449620 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ We gonna jump or jerk off?
L449617 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ Then we'll earn it together.  Here, take mine.
L449616 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ You gotta earn trust.
L449615 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
L449614 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
L449613 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
L449611 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ Yeah, I noticed you limping.  But don't worry about it, brah. Don't worry at all.  We're not gonna land on land!
L449610 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
L449609 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
L449608 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Once.
L449607 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ Ever done this before?
L449603 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ 'One shot stopping'... good, very good.  I like you, Johnny.  I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win.  I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it.  Check out the weight.
L449602 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ One shot stopping.
L449597 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  And I was just there the day before, cashing a check.  See... look.  Assured Trust... same place.
L449596 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ How you figure?
L449441 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
L449440 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
L449439 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ A flaw I'm working on.
L449438 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win.
L449437 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
L449436 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave.
L449435 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
L449434 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ I gotta be fucking crazy.
L449412 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ No, Bells Beach, Australia.
L449411 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
L449396 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed.
L449395 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Don't you gamble?
L449378 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ Come with Tyler.  She knows.
L449377 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Where?
L449376 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Gonna be some people at my house tonight.  Maybe you can make it.
L449375 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ De nada.
L449374 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Thanks for stepping in.
L449373 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.
L449372 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ You always talk like this?  You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
L449371 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
L449370 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ What's their program?
L449369 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
L449368 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Friends of yours, huh?
L449305 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Not yet.
L449304 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
L449303 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.
L449302 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ And that's why you never went pro?
L449301 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
L449300 +++$+++ u7118 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ BODHI +++$+++ Something happened.  You got nuked in the last quarter.
L449478 +++$+++ u7119 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ FIBERGLASS +++$+++ There's nobody else here...
L449477 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
L449476 +++$+++ u7119 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ FIBERGLASS +++$+++ Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
L449475 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?
L449468 +++$+++ u7119 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ FIBERGLASS +++$+++ No.
L449467 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
L449466 +++$+++ u7119 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ FIBERGLASS +++$+++ Yeah?  What?
L449695 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
L449694 +++$+++ u7120 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ HARP +++$+++ Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
L449318 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Caught my first tube this morning.
L449317 +++$+++ u7120 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ HARP +++$+++ Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
L449315 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ The correct term is babes, sir.  Uh, this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech.  Otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. Of the social infrastructure, I mean.
L449314 +++$+++ u7120 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ HARP +++$+++ What?
L449313 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Babes.
L449312 +++$+++ u7120 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ HARP +++$+++ A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
L449311 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ A little mushy.
L449310 +++$+++ u7120 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ HARP +++$+++ Surf conditions okay?
L449309 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Fine.
L449308 +++$+++ u7120 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ HARP +++$+++ How was the beach?
L449150 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Not so far.
L449149 +++$+++ u7120 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ HARP +++$+++ You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage.
L449147 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Zero distortion, sir.
L449146 +++$+++ u7120 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ HARP +++$+++ That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
L449145 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ 1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
L449144 +++$+++ u7120 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ HARP +++$+++ This is us.  Bank Robbery.  And you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world--
L449143 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ I take the skin off chicken.
L449142 +++$+++ u7120 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ HARP +++$+++ All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
L449141 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Sir?
L449140 +++$+++ u7120 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ HARP +++$+++ Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?
L449139 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L449138 +++$+++ u7120 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ HARP +++$+++ You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
L449699 +++$+++ u7120 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ HARP +++$+++ What that?
L449698 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Harp, let me tell you something.  I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't?
L449697 +++$+++ u7120 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ HARP +++$+++ Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You two screw-ups deserve each other. That's why I put you together in the first place.  Christ Pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind--
L449696 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Look, Harp.  Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk.  Let me ride him in.
L449194 +++$+++ u7120 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ HARP +++$+++ Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?
L449193 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
L449192 +++$+++ u7120 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ HARP +++$+++ That's the point, isn't it?
L449191 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years.
L449190 +++$+++ u7120 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ HARP +++$+++ Cole and Munoz.  I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.
L449189 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
L449188 +++$+++ u7120 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ HARP +++$+++ They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it.
L449721 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ NOOO!!
L449720 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Kid, get outta the way!!
L449719 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Angelo!  Don't fire!
L449702 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Figured you did.
L449701 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ I know where they're going.
L449561 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Nothing.
L449560 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Nothing?
L449547 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ You sure?!
L449546 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ They took a left at the next light!
L449545 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ The hell are they?!
L449536 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ That place up the street has meatball sandwiches.  Get me two.
L449535 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
L449534 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Time for lunch.
L449533 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
L449532 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
L449531 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
L449530 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ I say we call it in.  Get some backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp won't listen to me.
L449528 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ No way.  Not yet.  Come on.
L449527 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ They're on their way to Maui.
L449523 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Angelo... I'm right this time.  We can still win this one.
L449522 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.
L449521 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
L449520 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Yeah, or cashing a check.
L449519 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
L449518 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Did he rob it?
L449517 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day, right.  He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House...  ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
L449516 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ This Zen master surfer.
L449515 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ ... so I started tailing him.
L449512 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Angelo, we gotta talk.
L449511 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?
L449498 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Nice tattoo, Dietz.
L449497 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Aw shit.
L449464 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling.
L449463 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Got it.
L449462 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
L449461 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?
L449459 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Right here, partner.
L449458 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up?
L449391 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
L449390 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
L449385 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
L449384 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ ... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
L449382 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Okay, Dad.
L449381 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight.  Okay?
L449367 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Thanks, buddy.
L449366 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
L449345 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
L449344 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Big zippo so far.  How about you?
L449329 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.
L449328 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?
L449327 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Guy's the Toxic Avenger.
L449326 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Angelo, pay attention.  There's gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is showing traces of toxins.  PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
L449321 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Johnny, all I can say is we better come up with something real soon.
L449320 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
L449319 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
L449235 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Got it...
L449234 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ I think you gotta hit them straight on!
L449233 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ It's all balance, right?  And coordination.  How hard can it be?
L449232 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
L449231 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ They're like some kind of tribe. Got their own language.  You can't just walk up to these guys.  You've got to get out there.  Learn some moves.  Get into their head.  Pick up the speech.
L449229 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.
L449228 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Johnny, it's the only way.
L449221 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
L449220 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ ... Four months.  June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.
L449218 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Thanks for the tip.  I needed this knowledge.
L449217 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
L449216 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Sex wax?  You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?
L449215 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
L449214 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
L449213 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
L449212 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Oh well he must be a surfer.
L449210 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ The fucking punks are surfers.
L449209 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Yeah.  What's your theory?
L449208 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?
L449207 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Sorry.
L449206 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ You watch your fucking mouth!  Mr. Hoover himself pinned the Seal of Honor right here!
L449205 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
L449204 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Forget about it, kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?
L449203 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
L449202 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.
L449182 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid.
L449181 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs.
L449180 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Reagan usually drives.  Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance.  When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean vanish.
