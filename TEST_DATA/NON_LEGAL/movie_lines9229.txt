L353039 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ We'll remember. But that's a long time off...
L353038 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ Of course... that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...
L353033 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ At least it's over...
L353032 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ I'll make the arrangements.
L353031 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ They're put into the ground so they can be visited by the living...
L353030 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ What's that?
L353029 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ We'll have to bury him.
L352999 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ I don't know... but it does.
L352998 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ What people?
L352997 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ All this. All of it.
L352996 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ What belongs to the people?
L352989 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ "Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity."
L352988 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ No.
L352987 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
L352986 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I don't know.
L352985 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ What kind of jewel is this?
L352973 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ Mother and Father said so... you know?
L352972 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Are you sure?
L352971 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ Yes...
L352970 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
L352954 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ Yes indeed, everyone. Actually, they all have three.  "The naming of cats is a difficult matter. It isn't just one of your holiday games. You may think at first I'm mad as a hatter when I tell you a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES."  An ordinary name and a fancy name. That's two. Do you want to guess what the third one is?
L352953 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.
L352952 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.
L352720 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ No -- Look, I'm in a hurry.
L352719 +++$+++ u1863 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
L352718 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ It's all right with me. Is he here?
L352717 +++$+++ u1863 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
L352716 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
L352715 +++$+++ u1863 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
L352714 +++$+++ u1863 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ Do you want to see Doc?
L352713 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Hello.
L352712 +++$+++ u1863 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ Hello, Sandman.
L353088 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ Oh my... I'll try.
L353087 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Can you make it back?
L353086 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ Yes...
L353085 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L353084 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
L353083 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I know...  We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it.
L353072 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ Oh, yes... I think...
L353071 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Stay? They lived together all their years?
L353070 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
L353069 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Thank you.  Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"...
L353068 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ That's better than gold when it's cold.
L353066 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I promise. We'll go on as soon as it's light.
L353065 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon?
L353061 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ And all alive you say?
L353060 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ More... many more.
L353059 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
L353058 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ Alive?
L353057 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
L353054 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me.
L353053 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ We're leaving.
L353036 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ All right.
L353035 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Not yet.
L353034 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ Are you ready to put him in?
L352995 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ Of course you can stay. This belongs to the people.
L352994 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest.
L352993 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ Never, never, ever. Nothing.
L352992 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
L352991 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ No, no, no
L352990 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What's beyond this place -- do you know?
L352982 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.
L352981 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
L352980 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
L352979 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
L352975 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ Dead... they're dead... and buried.
L352974 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Where are they?
L352969 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
L352968 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
L352967 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What makes you think so?
L352966 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ But there may be a few around somewhere.
L352965 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Have any other people ever passed through?
L352964 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ Gracious... no.
L352963 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Are there any other humans?
L352962 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ I have always been here...
L352961 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ How did you get here?
L352960 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
L352959 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What kind of place is this?
L352958 +++$+++ u1862 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ For as long as I can remember.
L352957 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ How long have you been living here?
L352810 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back.  Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.
L352809 +++$+++ u1864 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how to go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock.
L352808 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
L352807 +++$+++ u1864 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
L352806 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
L352402 +++$+++ u1864 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7.

L352610 +++$+++ u1860 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ No -- just there -- on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.
L352421 +++$+++ u1860 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Too little?  Too little. Okay, wait for me.
L352420 +++$+++ u1865 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Too little.

L355812 +++$+++ u1877 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
L355811 +++$+++ u1867 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ Why not?
L355776 +++$+++ u1877 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
L355775 +++$+++ u1867 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ Why not?
L355772 +++$+++ u1877 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ How I remember them. Not necessarily the way they happened.
L355771 +++$+++ u1867 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ What do you mean by that?
L355770 +++$+++ u1877 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ I like to remember things my own way.
L355764 +++$+++ u1877 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ Yes, I thought my wife...

L355759 +++$+++ u1867 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
L355806 +++$+++ u1885 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ RENEE +++$+++ I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
L355805 +++$+++ u1867 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
L355781 +++$+++ u1885 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ RENEE +++$+++ No, one of us is always here to let the maid in. Nobody else has a key.
L355780 +++$+++ u1867 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ Maid? Relative?
L355779 +++$+++ u1885 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ RENEE +++$+++ No.

L355751 +++$+++ u1867 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ Very strange.

L356417 +++$+++ u1867 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ What's that, Ed?
L356416 +++$+++ u1876 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You know what I think?
L356415 +++$+++ u1867 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.
L356233 +++$+++ u1867 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ Ours, Ed.

L355800 +++$+++ u1867 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
L355797 +++$+++ u1876 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Or something.
L355796 +++$+++ u1867 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ You don't remember being awakened? It looks like you were aware of someone.
L355785 +++$+++ u1867 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ If anything else happens, you'll call us.
L355784 +++$+++ u1876 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ As best we can.
L355783 +++$+++ u1867 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ We'll keep a watch on the house.
L355778 +++$+++ u1867 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ Anybody else have a key to the house.
L355777 +++$+++ u1876 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Might be a good time to try using it again.
L355757 +++$+++ u1867 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ Right... This just glided along.
L355756 +++$+++ u1876 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Like you'd get if it was hand held.
L355755 +++$+++ u1867 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
L355754 +++$+++ u1876 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ How'd the camera get so high like that?
L356395 +++$+++ u1883 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Alice?
