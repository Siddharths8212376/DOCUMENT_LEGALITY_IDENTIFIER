L244968 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Tom isn't going to sit in with us, Johnny.  He only handles specific areas of the family business.  Tom?
L244943 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Connie's outside.
L244942 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
L244941 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ I'm sorry; of course, you know that.
L245907 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ He's going to try Panama...
L245906 +++$+++ u5546 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ NERI +++$+++ The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew.' His passport's been invalidated except for return to the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship.  They turned him down.
L245391 +++$+++ u5546 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ NERI +++$+++ How do I know you haven't gone into business for yourself?
L245390 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
L245389 +++$+++ u5546 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ NERI +++$+++ I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
L245388 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ No questions.
L245387 +++$+++ u5546 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ NERI +++$+++ What's up?
L245382 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Your plans are a little different this time.  You skip Miami, and go straight to Geneva.  It's to be deposited to this number.  And it's got to be there by Monday morning, no slip-up.
L245381 +++$+++ u5546 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ NERI +++$+++ We've never sent this much with one courier.
L245380 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Mike wants it.
L245379 +++$+++ u5546 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ NERI +++$+++ It might show.
L245378 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Twenty-five this time.
L245377 +++$+++ u5546 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ NERI +++$+++ Fifteen percent skim?
L245949 +++$+++ u5548 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ PENTANGELI +++$+++ Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.
L245948 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels.
L245946 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Yeah, that was a good break.  A nice deal.
L245945 +++$+++ u5548 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ PENTANGELI +++$+++ Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The little guys got knocked off.  If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.
L245944 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ The Roman Empire... when a plot against the Emperor failed, the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes.
L245943 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Yeah, it was once.
L245942 +++$+++ u5548 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ PENTANGELI +++$+++ Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
L245941 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.
L245940 +++$+++ u5548 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ PENTANGELI +++$+++ Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.
L245939 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then.
L245938 +++$+++ u5548 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ PENTANGELI +++$+++ Tom, what do I do now?
L245937 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ You're right.
L245936 +++$+++ u5548 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ PENTANGELI +++$+++ That's my brother.  Nothing could get him away from that two mule town.  He coulda been big over here -- he could of had his own Family.
L245935 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to dinner.  Just wanted to go home.
L245934 +++$+++ u5548 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ PENTANGELI +++$+++ He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.
L245933 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Yeah, but don't worry.
L245932 +++$+++ u5548 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ PENTANGELI +++$+++ Did my brother go back?
L245931 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Everything is going to be okay, Frankie, don't worry.
L245927 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ I'd like to go outside with him, in the open air.
L245926 +++$+++ u5548 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ PENTANGELI +++$+++ The room has a bug in it.
L245925 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ I think I prefer to see my client privately.
L245260 +++$+++ u5556 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SENATOR GEARY +++$+++ Thanks...friend.
L245259 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
L245258 +++$+++ u5556 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SENATOR GEARY +++$+++ And what's the price of their not finding out.
L245257 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
L245256 +++$+++ u5556 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SENATOR GEARY +++$+++ You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
L245255 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Our mistake.  But what does it matter; it was our money.  We don't even expect thanks.
L245254 +++$+++ u5556 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SENATOR GEARY +++$+++ There's thirty grand worth of paid off markers -- I never owed that much.
L245252 +++$+++ u5556 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SENATOR GEARY +++$+++ Maybe two, three thousand dollars.
L245251 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Do you owe markers?
L245250 +++$+++ u5556 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SENATOR GEARY +++$+++ A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
L245249 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Do you gamble?
L245248 +++$+++ u5556 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SENATOR GEARY +++$+++ No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.
L245247 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.
L245246 +++$+++ u5556 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SENATOR GEARY +++$+++ No strings.
L245245 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.
L245244 +++$+++ u5556 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SENATOR GEARY +++$+++ What the hell are you talking about?
L245243 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Actually, I've come with good news; the Corleone family has done you a favor.
L245242 +++$+++ u5556 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SENATOR GEARY +++$+++ ...and the tape will be running.
L245842 +++$+++ u5557 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SENATOR KANE +++$+++ The committee is adjourned until further notice.
L245841 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ This committee owes an apology!
L245840 +++$+++ u5557 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SENATOR KANE +++$+++ This meeting is adjourned.
L245839 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Senator Kane.
L245838 +++$+++ u5557 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SENATOR KANE +++$+++ The witness is excused; take him out.
L245837 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.
L245835 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ He is, I believe, a brother.
L245834 +++$+++ u5557 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SENATOR KANE +++$+++ Is he related to the witness?
L245833 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
L245832 +++$+++ u5557 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SENATOR KANE +++$+++ Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
L245787 +++$+++ u5557 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SENATOR KANE +++$+++ Very well.
L245786 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.
L245785 +++$+++ u5557 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SENATOR KANE +++$+++ I don't think that's necessary.
L245784 +++$+++ u5540 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record.
L245266 +++$+++ u5544 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.
L245265 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Whose orders are these?
L245264 +++$+++ u5544 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ If you could just give us a list, we'll pick up anything you want.
L245263 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I'm going to the market.
L245262 +++$+++ u5544 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through.
L245261 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Yes.
L245878 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ It wasn't a miscarriage.  And you with your cunning, couldn't you figure it out!  It was an abortion; an abortion, like our marriage is an abortion, something unholy and evil.  I don't want your son; I wouldn't bring another of your sons into this world.  An abortion, Michael... it was a son, and I had it killed, but this must all end!
L245877 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you.  I will make changes; I can.  I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.
L245876 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ The baby I lost...
L245875 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ How can I let you leave; how can I let you take my children away? Don't you know me?  You understand, it's an impossibility.  I would never let it happen; no, never, not if it took all my strength, all my cunning.  But in time, soon, you'll feel differently.  You see, you'll be happy that I stopped you.  I know you.  You'll forget about this; you'll forget about the baby we lost... and we'll go on, you and I.
L245874 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ You haven't heard me.
L245873 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
L245872 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has.
L245871 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.
L245870 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
L245869 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
L245868 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Michael.
L245867 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
L245866 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Goodbye, Michael.
L245865 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Kay, I told you...
L245864 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
L245863 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ When he saw his brother in the hearing room, he knew what was at stake.  I don't think Vincenzo would have done it.  He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It had nothing to do with me.  It was between those brothers.
L245862 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Kay, you've got it wrong.  That kind of thing's all over, I promised you.  This was between the two brothers.  Years ago Frankie had a young girlfriend; he called her his co-wife.  That was his joke, but he meant it.  He wouldn't divorce his wife... because she was a great cook.  He said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her.  He set her up in a house in Jersey.  She had to be faithful... and she had to have kids. And she did, two, a boy and a girl. He had her checked out and watched so she couldn't cheat... but the girl couldn't stand that kind of life.  She begged him to let her go. He did.  He gave her money and made her give up the kids.  Then Frankie took them to Italy, and had them brought up by his brother Vincenzo. Where he knew they'd by safe.
L245861 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ You would have killed his brother?
L245860 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one.  IF he was a traitor.
L245859 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face.
L245858 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ On a plane back to Sicily.
L245857 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
L245856 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ His brother came to help him.
L245855 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli?
L245854 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Why too late?
L245853 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
L245852 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about.  Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make.
L245851 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
L245850 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Why don't you sit down?
L245849 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
L245848 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Where?
L245847 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
L245846 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I had no idea...
L245225 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Have Tom Hagen meet me in the Harbor House.
L245224 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Leave her alone!  You're talking as though she has no right to be frightened when there are machine guns going off in her backyard.
L245074 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ It made me think of what you told me once.  In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.  That was seven years ago.
L245073 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
L245072 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Yes, Michael, it does.
L245071 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Does it feel like a boy?
L245070 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Sleeping inside me.
L245069 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ How's the baby?
L244985 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Yes, Michael.
L244984 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Kay.
L244983 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay. Please tell the Senator I won't be a minute.
L244982 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
L244981 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.
L244980 +++$+++ u5541 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Anthony, Daddy's busy.
L245084 +++$+++ u5542 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KLINGMAN +++$+++ Get out of my hotel.
L245083 +++$+++ u5546 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ NERI +++$+++ You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
L245082 +++$+++ u5542 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KLINGMAN +++$+++ You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
L245081 +++$+++ u5546 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ NERI +++$+++ You said you were Klingman.
L245080 +++$+++ u5542 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KLINGMAN +++$+++ Who do you think you're talking to?
L245079 +++$+++ u5546 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ NERI +++$+++ I represent the interests of the Corleone family.  We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
L245078 +++$+++ u5542 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KLINGMAN +++$+++ Right here.
L245077 +++$+++ u5546 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ NERI +++$+++ Where can we talk?
L245076 +++$+++ u5542 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ KLINGMAN +++$+++ Who's asking?
L245075 +++$+++ u5546 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ NERI +++$+++ Are you Klingman?
L245752 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ But times are different...
L245751 +++$+++ u5543 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MAMA +++$+++ Your family?  How can you ever lose your family?
L245750 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No, I meant lose his family.
L245749 +++$+++ u5543 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MAMA +++$+++ You talk about the baby.  She can have another baby.
L245748 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Alright.  They bother me once in awhile.  Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead?
L245747 +++$+++ u5543 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MAMA +++$+++ Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?
L245746 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ There are still things I have to do.
L245745 +++$+++ u5543 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MAMA +++$+++ I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
L245744 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?
L245549 +++$+++ u5552 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ROTH +++$+++ There was this kid that I grew up with; he was a couple years younger than me, and sort of looked up to me, you know.  We did our first work together, worked our way out of the street.  Things were good and we made the most of it.  During prohibition, we ran molasses up to Canada and made a fortune; your father too.  I guess as much as anyone, I loved him and trusted him. Later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stop-over for G.I.'s on the way to the West Coast. That kid's name was Moe Greene, and the city he invented was Las Vegas. This was a great man; a man with vision and guts; and there isn't even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town.  Someone put a bullet through his eye; no one knows who gave the order.  When I heard about it I wasn't angry.  I knew Moe; I knew he was headstrong, and talking loud, and saying stupid things.  So when he turned up dead, I let it go, and said to myself: this is the business we've chosen. I never asked, who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business.
L245548 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I know it wasn't me...so that leaves you.
L245547 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I know that; but who gave the go ahead.
L245546 +++$+++ u5552 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ROTH +++$+++ Why...the Rosato Brothers.
L245545 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
L245544 +++$+++ u5552 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ROTH +++$+++ Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
L245543 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?
L245542 +++$+++ u5552 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ROTH +++$+++ You're a careful kid, and that's good.  But look.  An international dispatch on the wire service. American journalism, not propaganda. The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels.  All but their radio station.
L245541 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Six million dollars in cash is a high price for a piece of a country in the middle of a revolution.
L245540 +++$+++ u5552 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ROTH +++$+++ Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.
L245539 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ This doubles my investment.
L245464 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You'll be there to see it; you'll be there.
L245463 +++$+++ u5552 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ROTH +++$+++ If only I could live to see it, kid; to be there with you.  How beautifully we've done it, step by step.  Here, protected, free to make our profits without the Justice Department, the FBI; ninety miles away in partnership with a friendly government.  Ninety miles, just a small step, looking for a man who desperately wants to be President of the United States, and having the cash to make it possible.
L245462 +++$+++ u5552 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ROTH +++$+++ Except the President of the United States.
L245461 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I wouldn't consider anyone else.
L245460 +++$+++ u5552 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ROTH +++$+++ Then you have to trace it.  Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man.  I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man.  But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me.  You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner.
L245459 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ The money was sent.
L245458 +++$+++ u5552 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ROTH +++$+++ My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
L245457 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.
L245456 +++$+++ u5552 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ROTH +++$+++ You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy.  It's always been that way, most men frighten easy.
L245451 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I saw an interesting thing today. A man was being arrested by the Military Police; probably an urban guerrilla.  Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him.
L245450 +++$+++ u5552 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ROTH +++$+++ Enjoy.
L245439 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
L245438 +++$+++ u5552 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ROTH +++$+++ I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.
L245317 +++$+++ u5552 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ROTH +++$+++ Of course you must keep control of your family.
L245316 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
L245315 +++$+++ u5552 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ROTH +++$+++ It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
L245314 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
L245313 +++$+++ u5552 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ROTH +++$+++ Nothing is more important.
L245312 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Technically, they are still under the Clemenza wing of the Corleone Family, now run by Frankie Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died, the Rosatos wanted territory of their own.  Pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them.  I, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter, turned him down.  Pentangeli was furious, and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed. I was lucky and he was stupid. I'll visit him soon.  The important thing is that nothing jeopardize our plans, yours and mine.  This thing of ours, that we will build.
L245311 +++$+++ u5552 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ROTH +++$+++ We do favors for each other...
L245310 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
L245309 +++$+++ u5552 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ROTH +++$+++ However I can help you...
L245308 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.
L245307 +++$+++ u5552 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ROTH +++$+++ You're a considerate young man.
L245306 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ The incident of the other night is a nuisance that I can take care of. I came to you because I want nothing to affect our agreement; I wanted to clear everything I'm going to do with you, just in case.
L245305 +++$+++ u5552 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ROTH +++$+++ What a mistake; people behaving like that, with guns.  It was my understanding we left all that behind.  But, let me tell you, the important thing is that you're all right.  Good health is the most important thing; more than success; more than power; more than money.
L245304 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Yes.
L245303 +++$+++ u5552 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ROTH +++$+++ I like sporting events -- I really enjoy watching them in the afternoon. One of the things I love about this country.  I loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919...I heard you had some trouble.
L245302 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Not for a few years.
L245301 +++$+++ u5552 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ ROTH +++$+++ Sit down, this is almost over.  You follow the baseball games?
L245454 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ So, that occurred to me.
L245453 +++$+++ u5553 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SAM ROTH +++$+++ So?
L245452 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It occurred to me: the police are paid to fight, and the Rebels are not.
L245425 +++$+++ u5553 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SAM ROTH +++$+++ Jake, Jake, come over here.  Mike, I want you to meet Jake Cohen; he manages the casino for us.
L245424 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Very impressive.
L245423 +++$+++ u5553 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SAM ROTH +++$+++ This is it!  We think it makes Vegas look like the corner crap game.
L245422 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No, I'm fine.
L245421 +++$+++ u5553 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ SAM ROTH +++$+++ Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all?
L245567 +++$+++ u5547 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ OLA +++$+++ Okay.  You know he doesn't have that kind of money.
L245566 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Let him gamble.
L245565 +++$+++ u5547 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ OLA +++$+++ They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.
L244979 +++$+++ u5547 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ OLA +++$+++ He always makes money for his partners.  One by one, our old friends are gone.  Death, natural or not, prison, deported.  Our friend in Miami is the only one left, because he always made money for his partners.
L244978 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated.  I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.
L244977 +++$+++ u5547 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ OLA +++$+++ The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys.  In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami.  He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along with you.
L244976 +++$+++ u5547 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ OLA +++$+++ He appreciates your concern, Michael, and your respect.
L244975 +++$+++ u5545 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
L244974 +++$+++ u5547 +++$+++ m369 +++$+++ OLA +++$+++ Not good.
