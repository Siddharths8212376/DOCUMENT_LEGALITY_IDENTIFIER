L161714 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
L161713 +++$+++ u4823 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WHORE +++$+++ You could always take it off.
L161712 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ This little thing says I can't.
L161711 +++$+++ u4823 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WHORE +++$+++ Funny.  Would you like to buy me a drink?
L161709 +++$+++ u4823 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WHORE +++$+++ Haven't seen you around.  Where have you been all my life, handsome?
L161708 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Hi.
L161707 +++$+++ u4823 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WHORE +++$+++ Hi.
L164865 +++$+++ u4825 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ BELLE +++$+++ They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain.  Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.
L164864 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Who are these people?
L164825 +++$+++ u4825 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ BELLE +++$+++ They're just outsiders. They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They're waiting for your guests, too --
L164824 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ What are those people doing there? What do they want?
L164752 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Oh --  Didn't mean to talk like that in front of a lady.  Get some wine for the Squire, Belle.
L164751 +++$+++ u4825 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ BELLE +++$+++ Jabez! Careful --
L164750 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Hey, you! Watch out there -- you're scuffing my Brussels carpet -- Consarn them.
L164746 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ The -- folks or people, what's the difference among friends?
L164745 +++$+++ u4825 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ BELLE +++$+++ The people, Jabez -- the people.
L164657 +++$+++ u4825 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ BELLE +++$+++ Of course I will.
L164656 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle.
L164643 +++$+++ u4825 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ BELLE +++$+++ We will --
L164642 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Golly, Belle, that was a good idea -- we should do that every morning.
L164631 +++$+++ u4825 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ BELLE +++$+++ No, Jabez -- your place is with your wife --
L164630 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Let's dance together -- Belle.
L164620 +++$+++ u4825 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ BELLE +++$+++ No -- that's for me to do.
L164619 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ I'll take it.
L164617 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ From over the mountain --
L164616 +++$+++ u4825 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ BELLE +++$+++ Belle Dee. I'm from over the mountain.
L164845 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ That's my problem, Belle.
L164844 +++$+++ u4825 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ BELLE +++$+++ You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
L164843 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
L164842 +++$+++ u4825 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ BELLE +++$+++ You know that you're in my house.
L164841 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Lying to you -- Why should I?
L164840 +++$+++ u4825 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ BELLE +++$+++ You're lying.
L164839 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I didn't.
L164838 +++$+++ u4825 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ BELLE +++$+++ I see why you're here -- you knew that nobody was coming.
L164695 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ He lied to me again.
L164694 +++$+++ u4825 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ BELLE +++$+++ That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do?
L164626 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Thank you, Belle --
L164625 +++$+++ u4825 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ BELLE +++$+++ Belle --
L164624 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No, thank you -- what's your name?
L164623 +++$+++ u4825 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ BELLE +++$+++ You're not resting well, are you? I know -- it's that music.  You need your sleep. Is there anything else you want?
L164622 +++$+++ u4825 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ BELLE +++$+++ I've brought you something to keep you warm, Mrs. Stone --
L164621 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Jabez -- ?
L164803 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.
L164802 +++$+++ u4826 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
L164801 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
L164800 +++$+++ u4826 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Anybody can see that.
L164799 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
L164798 +++$+++ u4826 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ What's that, sir?
L164797 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
L164796 +++$+++ u4826 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
L164795 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
L164794 +++$+++ u4826 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
L164793 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ It does hurt! And don't you do it again.
L164792 +++$+++ u4826 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Why? It don't hurt.
L164791 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Daniel! Don't ever let me catch you doing that again!
L164790 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ And serve him right!
L164789 +++$+++ u4826 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
L164788 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ And what about Daniel Webster?
L164787 +++$+++ u4826 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
L164786 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
L164785 +++$+++ u4826 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ 'N Daniel Webster will be there.
L164784 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Young man -- you got me there.
L164783 +++$+++ u4826 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
L164782 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Guess there will, if it says so.
L164781 +++$+++ u4826 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be --  -- a man that eats fire?
L164780 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ It hasn't opened yet?
L164779 +++$+++ u4826 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Gee -- that Fair --
L164778 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ All right, Daniel. Jump in.
L164777 +++$+++ u4826 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.
L164776 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?
L164956 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ All right, darling.
L164955 +++$+++ u4826 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
L164954 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.
L164953 +++$+++ u4826 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Mama!
L164823 +++$+++ u4826 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ No, no, I don't want to go to bed. I want to be here for the party.
L164822 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Daniel, you ought to be in bed.
L164690 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Daniel! ...  I've stood just about as much as I can bear!
L164689 +++$+++ u4826 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ No! No! I won't.
L164688 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Daniel give me that beanshooter!
L164687 +++$+++ u4826 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
L164686 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yes, you did, Daniel! I saw it from the window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, Daniel!
L164710 +++$+++ u4826 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Not me! 
L164709 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
L164708 +++$+++ u4826 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Grandma, look at me!
L164685 +++$+++ u4826 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ I did not, Grandma.
L164684 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Lan's to goodness, what happened to that hen? Did you use that beanshooter again?
L164683 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ That's just too bad --
L164682 +++$+++ u4826 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ But I like the new one better.
L164681 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
L164680 +++$+++ u4826 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ DANIEL +++$+++ Granny, when do we move to the new house?
L164532 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Now don't you worry about that. You just leave it all to me. We won't talk business now ... just bear this in mind ... I'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck.... No, sir... not me! ...
L164531 +++$+++ u4827 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ Say ... about the interest ...
L164529 +++$+++ u4827 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ Thanks, Jabez -- I really wouldn't need very much ... if you could let me have some seed to start off with enough for spring planting ...
L164528 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
L164527 +++$+++ u4827 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
L164526 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
L164525 +++$+++ u4827 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
L164524 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
L164523 +++$+++ u4827 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
L164522 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
L164521 +++$+++ u4827 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
L164520 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Howdy, Hank.
L164519 +++$+++ u4827 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ Howdy, Jabez.
L165032 +++$+++ u4838 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ TOM SHARP +++$+++ We'll be mighty glad to have you with us.
L165031 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
L165030 +++$+++ u4838 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ TOM SHARP +++$+++ Jabez -- will you join our Grange now?
L164291 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ I'll look out for myself! ... Now go away -- leave me alone.
L164290 +++$+++ u4838 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ TOM SHARP +++$+++ Well -- we don't mean to force you, Jabez Stone -- but -- it's only for your own good.
L164287 +++$+++ u4838 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ TOM SHARP +++$+++ That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day.
L164286 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ What Grange?
L164285 +++$+++ u4838 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ TOM SHARP +++$+++ Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
L164284 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ What do you want?
L164204 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Black Dan'l?
L164203 +++$+++ u4838 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ TOM SHARP +++$+++ Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
L164202 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington.
L164201 +++$+++ u4838 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ TOM SHARP +++$+++ That's fair enough, Jabez. Man's got a right to mull things over. We'll drive round again, week or so.
L164200 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Sure does. But I'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.
L164194 +++$+++ u4838 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ TOM SHARP +++$+++ Yes, it's the debt and the lien and the mortgage that eats up the farmer!
L164193 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Sure am.
L164192 +++$+++ u4838 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ TOM SHARP +++$+++ Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
L164191 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
L164190 +++$+++ u4838 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ TOM SHARP +++$+++ Loan shark -- hey?
L164615 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Belle --
L164614 +++$+++ u4837 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ THE WOMAN +++$+++ Belle.
L164613 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Never mind. What's your name?
L164610 +++$+++ u4837 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ THE WOMAN +++$+++ But she is -- I've taken her place. Don't you remember -- you wrote me a letter. Mrs. Stone was too ill.
L164609 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ She couldn't be gone!
L164608 +++$+++ u4837 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ THE WOMAN +++$+++ No. She's gone.
L164607 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ You're not -- Dorothy.
L164863 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Stevens -- what's all this leading up to? You know something. Come on! Out with it -- you know something about me!
L164862 +++$+++ u4836 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ STEVENS +++$+++ I do -- and I think you should too.
L164861 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
L164860 +++$+++ u4836 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ STEVENS +++$+++ What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
L164859 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ All right -- so it's buried with you!
L164858 +++$+++ u4836 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ STEVENS +++$+++ Don't say that -- I know it is --
L164857 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
L164856 +++$+++ u4836 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ STEVENS +++$+++ But what becomes of our souls?
L164855 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.
L164854 +++$+++ u4836 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ STEVENS +++$+++ -- of what happens after we die!
L164853 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Afraid ... of what?
L164852 +++$+++ u4836 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ STEVENS +++$+++ You are afraid!
L164851 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ What's the matter with you?
L164849 +++$+++ u4836 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ STEVENS +++$+++ Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--
L164848 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
L164847 +++$+++ u4836 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ STEVENS +++$+++ What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
L164846 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Now run along, Daniel.
L164832 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ I dunno -- I can't figure it out. I've invited them all. Why don't they come?
L164831 +++$+++ u4836 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ STEVENS +++$+++ Where's everybody?
L164830 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ No, you're not.
L164829 +++$+++ u4836 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ STEVENS +++$+++ Good evening -- I'm sorry, Jabez -- I'm a little late.
L164661 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Some other time, Stevens.
L164660 +++$+++ u4836 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ STEVENS +++$+++ Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
L164659 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
L164658 +++$+++ u4836 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ STEVENS +++$+++ Mornin', Jabez ...
L164339 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Doesn't satisfy, eh? Well -- that's too bad....
L164338 +++$+++ u4836 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ STEVENS +++$+++ Real! Sheriff, you are a witness that this money is paid me voluntarily, and while it does not satisfy the mortgage, it has become my property.
L164337 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ You know -- some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air.  Like that!
L164336 +++$+++ u4836 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ STEVENS +++$+++ I'd like to know where you'd get it....
L164335 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ -- in gold.
L164334 +++$+++ u4836 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ STEVENS +++$+++ No, Stone!
L164333 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --
L164332 +++$+++ u4836 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ STEVENS +++$+++ Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
L164331 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Stevens!
L164997 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
L164996 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ You know darn well it is.
L164995 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?
L164994 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me.
L164991 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ That is highly irrelevant to this case, Your Honor.
L164990 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
L164989 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?
L164952 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Never!
L164951 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
L164950 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ About what?
L164949 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?
L164909 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ Come, come, Mr. Stone, you are a little upset. It's not fair to bargain with you now. -- I'll give you until midnight, Mr. Stone, but not one minute more. Ah, then you'll come with me indeed.
L164908 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
L164907 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
L164906 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
L164905 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--
L164904 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
L164903 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
L164902 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
L164901 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
L164900 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ I'm through with you.
L164899 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
L164898 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ My time isn't up yet.
L164897 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
L164896 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Are they all as -- small -- as that?
L164894 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ He was --
L164893 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
L164892 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ .... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance.
L164888 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ Just a minute, neighbor Stone. I promised you money and all that money can buy. I don't recall any other obligations. But let's look at the contract.
L164887 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
L164886 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ Why, Mr. Stone, you look so worried. Can I be of any service?
L164561 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ Oh, certainly. I shan't even come to the christening -- it would be tactless and in wretched bad taste.  But I may send a friend of mine -- just for old sake's sake. Yes, I might do that.
L164560 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Leave your tongue off of that!
L164559 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ But you should, now that you are becoming a father.
L164558 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ I don't care.
L164557 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
L164556 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Look here now--
