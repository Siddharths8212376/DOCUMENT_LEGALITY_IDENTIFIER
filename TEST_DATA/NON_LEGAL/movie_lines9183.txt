L313446 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
L313445 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yeah, that really hit the spot.
L313443 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Sure.
L313442 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Wanna fuck?
L313441 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Not really. We didn't have much to say to each other anyway. I never got to know him that well, but I knew enough to know I wasn't missing much. I keep that, because of all the fuckin' time I was there, that's the only picture I got of me in Japan.  That's Japan.
L313440 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ That sounds like a problem.
L313439 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
L313438 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Must of made quite an impression.
L313437 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
L313436 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Who's arm is that?
L313435 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ About five years ago.
L313434 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You lived in Japan, when?
L313433 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I lived there for about nine months.
L313432 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You been to Japan?
L313431 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ That's a picture of me in Japan.
L313430 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
L313429 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Did you ever go I one?
L313428 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I don't like dancing.
L313427 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ C'mon, don't lie.
L313426 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ No.
L313425 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Were you a disco guy?
L313424 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ We had done time together already.
L313423 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ With Ordell?
L313422 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Detroit.
L313421 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Where were you?
L313420 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ No.
L313419 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ That was taken at a place called "Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then?
L313418 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.
L313417 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ So where did you go?
L313416 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
L313415 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Were you a disco girl?
L313414 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
L313413 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I thought you were sixteen.
L313412 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L313411 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You're fourteen years old here?
L313410 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Fourteen.
L313409 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ The roller disco one.
L313408 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Which one?
L313406 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ No thanks.
L313405 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
L313404 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ It's a diet thing?
L313403 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
L313402 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What's a Metrix?
L313401 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Want a Metrix?
L313393 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Coughing opens up the capillaries. When you cough, you're getting air -- in this case smoke -- to parts of the lung that don't normally get used. Coughing's good -- gets ya higher. My dad coughs when he smokes all the time.
L313392 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
L313391 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ You okay?
L313385 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Yeah, there's another hit left.
L313384 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Is it ready to go?
L312804 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Really, I'm impressed.
L312803 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Bank robbery.
L312802 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ What for?
L312801 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L312800 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Four years?
L312799 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Two months shy of four years.
L312798 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ How long?
L312797 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Susanville.
L312796 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Where at?
L312795 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Four days ago.
L312794 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ When did you get out of jail?
L312793 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Sure.
L312792 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Want a hit?
L312791 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ He's just repeating shit he overheard. He ain't any more a gun expert than I am.
L312790 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
L312789 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
L312788 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I can sit through it once.
L312787 +++$+++ u1596 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ It's boring, isn't it?
L314049 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! The reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
L314048 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons.
L314047 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Man, I don't want to hear your fuckin' excuses!
L314046 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
L314045 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
L314044 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ How am I supposed to know that?
L314043 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.
L314042 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other?
L314041 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ You see Max Cherry in the dress department. We're about to be handed half-a-million dollars -- Man, look at me when I'm talking to you! And you don't think nothing of him being there!
L314040 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Max Cherry.
L314039 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ You gonna tell me who it was?
L314038 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
L314037 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Tell me.
L314036 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You know who I saw in the dress department?
L314035 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ What?
L314034 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Jesus Christ.
L314033 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Or...  ...she gave it to somebody else first, before Melanie went in the dressing room.
L314032 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
L314031 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
L314030 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
L314029 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
L314028 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Maybe the Feds got it.
L314027 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ 'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
L314026 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
L314025 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
L314022 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ It's in there.
L314021 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ What'd you shoot her with?
L314020 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Pull the car over.
L314019 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Fuck you for asking me that.
L314018 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
L314017 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ That's right.
L314016 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Where you shot her.
L314015 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ We went to the parking lot.
L314014 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Then what?
L314013 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.
L314012 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
L314011 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Maybe a minute. She came right out.
L314010 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ How long was she in there?
L314009 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
L314008 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Came outta where?
L314007 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I.
L314006 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
L314005 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You said five hundred and fifty!
L314004 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
L314003 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ How much it there?
L314002 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Where's the rest of it?
L314001 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What?
L314000 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Louis?
L313999 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Well, if you had to do it, you had to do it. What we don't want is that bitch surviving on us. Anybody but that woman.
L313998 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ In the chest and stomach.
L313997 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Where did you shoot her?
L313996 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Pretty sure.
L313995 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ So you're sure she's dead.
L313994 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L313993 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ You shot her twice?
L313992 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
L313991 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ You couldn't just hit her?
L313990 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You know how she is.
L313989 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Couldn't talk to her?
L313988 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Twice. In the parking lot.
L313987 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ You shot Melanie?
L313985 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I shot her.
L313984 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ So what, you left her there.
L313983 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou- is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves.
L313982 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about.  Hey, where's Melanie?
L313981 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Not now, pick me up.
L313980 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
L313979 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
L313978 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
L313977 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
L313976 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
L313975 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Did you get it?
L313974 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ It's Louis.
L313894 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Go in there, snatch her by the hair, and drag her big ass out. This is my goddam money we're talking about. Get your ass out the door.
L313893 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'
L313892 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Well, you the one in motherfuckin' charge.
L313731 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Hang it up, she's on her way. You gotta listen to this. This involves you.
L313730 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L313701 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ I told you, man.  She my fine little surfer gal.
L313700 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I still don't understand why you keep her around.
L313699 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ You can't trust Melanie. But you can always trust Melanie to be Melanie.
L313698 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What does that mean?
L313697 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
L313696 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
L313695 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ 'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
L313694 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Well, why the fuck keep her around?
L313693 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
L313692 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yep.
L313691 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?
L313690 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ That's not what I meant when I asked did you trust her.
L313689 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ If this is about you fucked Melanie, I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool. I leave you alone with a bitch like Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that twenty minutes after I'm out the door. So say "thank you" and I'll tell you, "you're welcome."
L313687 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's ever been, anyway.
L313686 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ She believed you?
L313685 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
L313684 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What's your relationship?
L313683 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Sure.
L313682 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Can I ask you about Melanie?
L313681 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise.
L313680 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ How much is there?
L313375 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going.
L313374 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I didn't look like a bum.
L312970 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I follow.
L312969 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ So we on the same page then?
L312968 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yeah.
L312967 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
L312966 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What did he do?
L312965 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ An employee I had to let go.
L312964 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Who was Beaumont?
L312963 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ That was Beaumont.
L312962 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Who was that?
L312959 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Then put your goddam drawers on, and get your ass out here. I got somethin' to show you.
L312958 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I'm in my underwear.
L312957 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
L312956 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ C'mon in.
L312955 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L312954 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You're outside?
L312953 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
L312952 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ The moon -- I dunno
L312951 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ I know you don't know. I said guess.
L312950 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I dunno.
L312949 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Guess where I am?
L312948 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
L312947 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Whatcha watchin'?
L312946 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
L312945 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
L312863 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Now play the volume as loud as you want but don't touch my levels. I got them set just the way I want 'em.
L312862 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Okay.
L312861 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
L312860 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What do I do?
L312859 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ This one's for the ignition...  ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.
L312858 +++$+++ u1594 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Which one is for the car?
L312857 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
L312854 +++$+++ u1598 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ORDELL +++$+++ Sure.  We almost done, ain't we?
