L339128 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Can India help us?
L339127 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
L339126 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
L339125 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
L339120 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ What is the danger from the Chinese, now?
L339119 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ Ask whatever you will.
L339118 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.
L339107 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ You are the man who wrote this letter. You are the man who has come back to lead us. You will soon have great responsibilities. You must know what to do.
L339106 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ What can I do? I am only a boy.
L339098 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Look here!
L339097 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun.
L339086 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ When it is time.
L339085 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Tell me.
L339084 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ He warned about the future of Tibet.
L339083 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama?
L339078 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ I do not know, Holiness.
L339077 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Where is Alsace?
L339076 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ It is an island. American territory.
L339075 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ In the Pacific Ocean.
L339065 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Will we ever be in war?
L339064 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ No. This war is almost over.
L339063 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Will we be in this war?
L339062 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ The Regent is adding men. And he bought rifles and ammunition from India. Mountain guns, too.
L339061 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ No. Not very big.
L339060 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Is that big?
L339059 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ Roughly five thousand men.
L339058 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ How big is Tibet's army?
L339057 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Please.
L339056 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
L338869 +++$+++ u6244 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Thank you.
L338868 +++$+++ u6246 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
L338867 +++$+++ u6244 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
L338866 +++$+++ u6246 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Please, come in, so cold.
L338865 +++$+++ u6244 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Good day.
L338864 +++$+++ u6246 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Good day.
L339384 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Always.
L339383 +++$+++ u6245 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MAO TSE TUNG +++$+++ You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
L339382 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.
L339381 +++$+++ u6245 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MAO TSE TUNG +++$+++ Yes, I am aware. How has your time in China been?
L339380 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ I leave tomorrow.
L339379 +++$+++ u6245 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MAO TSE TUNG +++$+++ Ah, Dalai Lama, thank you for coming so late.
L339376 +++$+++ u6245 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MAO TSE TUNG +++$+++ Have a sweet. Made in my home province. The kind my mother used to make.
L339375 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
L339374 +++$+++ u6245 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MAO TSE TUNG +++$+++ You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix.
L339373 +++$+++ u6245 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MAO TSE TUNG +++$+++ Good. Very good. Tibet is a great country. A wonderful history. Long ago, you even conquered part of China. But now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. In twenty years time you could be ahead of us. Then it will be your turn to help China.
L339372 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao. I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay.
L339371 +++$+++ u6245 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MAO TSE TUNG +++$+++ It is too early to implement all the clauses of the Seventeen Point Agreement. We will establish a Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region of Tibet. The pace of reform must meet with the desires of the Tibetan people. Changes must be made slowly, as you, yourself, judge necessary.
L339370 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
L339369 +++$+++ u6245 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MAO TSE TUNG +++$+++ You must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the Tibetans trust and good nature.
L339427 +++$+++ u6246 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ You decide.
L339426 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Do you think I must?
L339029 +++$+++ u6246 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I have one more piece of news. A baby is coming.
L339028 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ You will always!
L339027 +++$+++ u6246 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Me?
L339026 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ But you will always be here?
L339025 +++$+++ u6246 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I turn you over again, today, Lhamo. One day, you will not be able to come running to us.
L339024 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
L339023 +++$+++ u6246 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
L339022 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
L339021 +++$+++ u6246 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.
L339264 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.
L339263 +++$+++ u6247 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ NOBLE BOY +++$+++ What does the butter spot feel like?
L339262 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ You decide.
L339261 +++$+++ u6247 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ NOBLE BOY +++$+++ True.
L339260 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ What do you think?
L339259 +++$+++ u6247 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ NOBLE BOY +++$+++ Is that a true story, or pretend?
L339258 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
L339257 +++$+++ u6247 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ NOBLE BOY +++$+++ Does he have the spot?
L339256 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died, my mother was so sad. A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born.
L339219 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ And you have grown older and your chin has grown balder.
L339218 +++$+++ u6248 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ NORBU THUNDRUP +++$+++ You have grown up very good.
L339217 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ We have.
L339216 +++$+++ u6248 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ NORBU THUNDRUP +++$+++ We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
L339215 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ I will miss you.
L339214 +++$+++ u6248 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ NORBU THUNDRUP +++$+++ You must study very hard, do not neglect the holy things during this time.
L339212 +++$+++ u6248 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ NORBU THUNDRUP +++$+++ The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.
L339211 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Am I running away?
L339210 +++$+++ u6248 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ NORBU THUNDRUP +++$+++ No, Holiness.
L339209 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ You will not come?
L339179 +++$+++ u6248 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ NORBU THUNDRUP +++$+++ Oh, but you do, Kundun. Who else would be here?
L339178 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ But, I have no experience.
L339177 +++$+++ u6248 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ NORBU THUNDRUP +++$+++ These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
L339176 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
L339175 +++$+++ u6248 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ NORBU THUNDRUP +++$+++ The people want you made Dalai Lama.
L339096 +++$+++ u6248 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ NORBU THUNDRUP +++$+++ Reting Rinpoche has been arrested. He tried to overthrow Regent Taktra. Today, he is brought back to Lhasa by government officials. The monks at Sera Monastery have been on his side. Now, there is trouble between them and the army.
L339095 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Why is this? What is happening? Tell me!
L339080 +++$+++ u6248 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ NORBU THUNDRUP +++$+++ Ahh.
L339079 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ This is Tibet. And this is China.
L339073 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Where is Poland?
L339072 +++$+++ u6248 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ NORBU THUNDRUP +++$+++ Ahh.
L339071 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ This is Britain.
L339069 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
L339068 +++$+++ u6248 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ NORBU THUNDRUP +++$+++ Yes.
L339067 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ The Chinese.
L339066 +++$+++ u6248 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ NORBU THUNDRUP +++$+++ We have enemies.
L338986 +++$+++ u6248 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ NORBU THUNDRUP +++$+++ I would not know. Maybe.
L338985 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
L338984 +++$+++ u6248 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ NORBU THUNDRUP +++$+++ But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
L338983 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
L338982 +++$+++ u6248 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ NORBU THUNDRUP +++$+++ You cannot.
L338981 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
L338980 +++$+++ u6248 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ NORBU THUNDRUP +++$+++ You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
L338979 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ I want to go down there.
L338975 +++$+++ u6248 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ NORBU THUNDRUP +++$+++ As you say.
L338974 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Pretend.
L338973 +++$+++ u6248 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ NORBU THUNDRUP +++$+++ It is a story, you decide.
L338972 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Is that true or pretend?
L338971 +++$+++ u6248 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ NORBU THUNDRUP +++$+++ She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.
L338955 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.
L338954 +++$+++ u6248 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ NORBU THUNDRUP +++$+++ Things change, Kundun.
L338952 +++$+++ u6248 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ NORBU THUNDRUP +++$+++ I have smarter men.
L338951 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ I have more men.
L338950 +++$+++ u6248 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ NORBU THUNDRUP +++$+++ I am braver.
L338949 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.
L338948 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ I'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men.
L339201 +++$+++ u6249 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TAKSTER RINPOCHE +++$+++ It may not be your decision to make.
L339200 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ How could I ever leave?
L339199 +++$+++ u6249 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TAKSTER RINPOCHE +++$+++ You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.
L339198 +++$+++ u6249 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TAKSTER RINPOCHE +++$+++ These are not human beings. They are worse than ghosts.
L339197 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.
L339196 +++$+++ u6249 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TAKSTER RINPOCHE +++$+++ This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
L339195 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ We cannot.
L339194 +++$+++ u6249 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TAKSTER RINPOCHE +++$+++ The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.
L339193 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now.
L339192 +++$+++ u6249 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TAKSTER RINPOCHE +++$+++ I do.
L339191 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
L339190 +++$+++ u6249 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TAKSTER RINPOCHE +++$+++ Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.
L339188 +++$+++ u6249 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TAKSTER RINPOCHE +++$+++ Eliminate you.
L339187 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ You, kill me?
L339186 +++$+++ u6249 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TAKSTER RINPOCHE +++$+++ They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
L339185 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Tell me.
L339155 +++$+++ u6250 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TAKTRA RINPOCHE +++$+++ Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
L339154 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
L339153 +++$+++ u6250 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TAKTRA RINPOCHE +++$+++ It is a difficult situation.
L339152 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
L339151 +++$+++ u6250 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TAKTRA RINPOCHE +++$+++ What would you do, Holiness?
L339150 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost.
L339113 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Good. Where is Reting Rinpoche now?
L339112 +++$+++ u6250 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TAKTRA RINPOCHE +++$+++ Completely.
L339111 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ You are unharmed?
L339110 +++$+++ u6250 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TAKTRA RINPOCHE +++$+++ It is possible, Holiness.
L339109 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Taktra Rinpoche, I understand there was an attempt on your life.
L339255 +++$+++ u6252 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TIBETAN WOMAN +++$+++ I see that.
L339254 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Like my mother.
L339253 +++$+++ u6252 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TIBETAN WOMAN +++$+++ Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
L339252 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Much too young.
L339251 +++$+++ u6252 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TIBETAN WOMAN +++$+++ Too young?
L339250 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ No.
L339248 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Does he treat you fairly?
L339247 +++$+++ u6252 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TIBETAN WOMAN +++$+++ The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.
L339246 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Hmm.
L339245 +++$+++ u6252 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TIBETAN WOMAN +++$+++ I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
L339244 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Did you love your husband, before you married?
L340828 +++$+++ u6254 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ BICKERMAN +++$+++ You're all fuckers.  Vicious little fuckers.
L340827 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
L340826 +++$+++ u6254 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ BICKERMAN +++$+++ You can't take a cow by eminent domain.
L340735 +++$+++ u6254 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ BICKERMAN +++$+++ No.  Do you?
L340734 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ He just <u>appeared</u>.  You have no idea how he arrived in this lake?
L340328 +++$+++ u6254 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ BICKERMAN +++$+++ Oh, yes.
L340327 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You killed him.
L340326 +++$+++ u6254 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ BICKERMAN +++$+++ Oh yes.  I killed him.
L340325 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.  Do you know how your husband died?
L340825 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Go ahead.
L340824 +++$+++ u6254 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ BICKERMAN +++$+++ I'll sue you.
L340748 +++$+++ u6254 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ BICKERMAN +++$+++ Thank you, Officer Fuckmeat.
L340747 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.
L340746 +++$+++ u6254 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ BICKERMAN +++$+++ Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  <u>No</u>.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile...
L340741 +++$+++ u6254 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ BICKERMAN +++$+++ Nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake.  it's really <u>his</u> lake now.
L340740 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Ma'am, how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and--
L340737 +++$+++ u6254 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ BICKERMAN +++$+++ <u>No</u>, <u>I</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>.  The crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake.
L340736 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?
L340731 +++$+++ u6254 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ BICKERMAN +++$+++ The <u>reason</u> I lied is if I'd told you the truth, you'd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you're doing.
L340730 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Oh, but you <u>have</u>, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.
L340729 +++$+++ u6254 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ BICKERMAN +++$+++ I haven't broken any laws.
L340330 +++$+++ u6254 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ BICKERMAN +++$+++ Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering.  I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off.  Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.
L340329 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?
L340320 +++$+++ u6254 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ BICKERMAN +++$+++ Oh well, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you keep such a firm track of the dead.
L340319 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
L340318 +++$+++ u6254 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ BICKERMAN +++$+++ Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
L340765 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ <u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
L340764 +++$+++ u6255 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ GARE +++$+++ Go!!!
L340760 +++$+++ u6255 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ GARE +++$+++ Jesus.  About twelve more yards.  Keep coming just like that.
L340759 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ <u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
L340758 +++$+++ u6255 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ GARE +++$+++ I might get a shot.
L340745 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ He's not gonna hurt <u>me</u>.
L340744 +++$+++ u6255 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ GARE +++$+++ <u>Please</u>.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.
L340743 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ I need to see his habitat.
L340742 +++$+++ u6255 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ GARE +++$+++ C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't--
L340704 +++$+++ u6255 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ GARE +++$+++ <u>So</u> <u>why</u> <u>are</u> <u>we</u> <u>landing</u>?  <u>Hector</u>.
L340703 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ 'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
L340702 +++$+++ u6255 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ GARE +++$+++ Why are we landing?
L340701 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ It happens when I land.
L340700 +++$+++ u6255 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ GARE +++$+++ It seems like we're getting lower.
L340449 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ And law enforcement, such dangerous work.  The idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity.
L340448 +++$+++ u6255 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ GARE +++$+++ Thank you.
L340447 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ You're a beautiful woman.
L340902 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ I don't know!
L340901 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Where is he?!
L340899 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ I see blood.  Maybe you got him, Hank.
L340898 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
