L294974 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.
L294967 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ I don't know. Something's missing.
L294966 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
L294927 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ That's Lila?
L294926 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Lila?
L294910 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
L294909 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
L294902 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Don't be silly!  And you were wonderful, too! I loved the way you said " au revoir."
L294901 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
L294900 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ You were wonderful!
L294858 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ You hurt me, you know, when you made Nathan's Choice. Does that not even matter to you, you pig?
L294857 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
L294856 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Hunh.
L294855 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts!  I love you, Gabrielle.
L294854 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ That's not how he tells it.
L294853 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
L294852 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
L294851 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ No!
L294850 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ I've moved on.
L294849 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
L294848 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Anyway. Come already to the point.
L294847 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ No. You look so beautiful.
L294846 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Please. I look a mess.
L294845 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ God, you're beautiful.
L294844 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Well?
L294841 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Well, look, I'm sorry to have bothered you.
L294840 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
L294839 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ What?
L294838 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!
L294837 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Well, I think...
L294836 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ What for?
L294835 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.
L294834 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Like what?
L294833 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ I've got some things to tell you.
L294832 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
L294831 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Please. Just one minute of your time.
L294830 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ We have nothing to say! You are a rotten bastard, that's what!
L294829 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ I just want to talk.
L294828 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Call you back.  You bastard! What do you want?
L294827 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Hi. It's Nathan.
L294826 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Yeah? What?
L294762 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Take me, darling! Tame your little monkey of love!
L294761 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Urgh.
L294760 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.
L294759 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Unnhh.
L294758 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.
L294730 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ But I don't know how to leave Lila.
L294729 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
L294728 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ I love you so much, Gabrielle.
L294727 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.
L294726 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
L294725 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
L294724 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ What is it?
L294723 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Stop. Get away.
L294722 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ My little French.
L294721 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Very well.
L294720 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Not in front of the boy.
L294719 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Fine.
L294718 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
L294717 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Gabby, what is it?
L294716 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Hmmmph.
L294715 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
L294686 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
L294685 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
L294684 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
L294683 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye.  What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?
L294676 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Shit.  Hi, honey.
L294675 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
L294670 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
L294669 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ What is wrong, my darling?
L294662 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Shh.
L294661 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ So soft. So smooth.  I'm sorry. It's just...
L294659 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ You are sweet.
L294658 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ It's true. I wouldn't lie.
L294657 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
L294656 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
L294655 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
L294654 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
L294653 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ I am sleepy.
L294652 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all.
L294651 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
L294650 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Yes. Happy happy.
L294649 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
L294648 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
L294647 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Shall we close up, then?
L294645 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ That would be good.
L294644 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Oui.
L294643 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ When you were a little French girl?
L294642 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
L294641 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
L294640 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son?
L294639 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?
L294638 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
L294637 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
L294636 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Is everything fine?
L294635 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
L294634 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
L294633 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think.  God, Did I hang up on you?
L294632 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.
L294607 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
L294606 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
L294603 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ You're so sweet. Oh, why are there not more men out there like you?
L294602 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Of course not.
L294601 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?
L294600 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Not at all.
L294599 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Thank you so much for accompanying me.
L294598 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
L294597 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ No. Don't be silly. It's just...
L294596 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
L294595 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...
L294594 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
L294593 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.
L294592 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you.  Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.
L294591 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.
L294588 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Good morning, Puff Bronfman. I'm Dr. Bronfman and this is my assistant Gabrielle. We're your mommy and daddy while you are here.
L294587 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Oui. Perfect!
L294586 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
L294585 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
L294584 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ You decide. Today is your day.
L294583 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Oui.
L294582 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Good morning...  We need a name for him, don't we?
L294581 +++$+++ u1404 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ GABRIELLE +++$+++ Oui, doctor, oui.
L294580 +++$+++ u1407 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?
L295029 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Okay. If you think it will help.
L295028 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
L295027 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ That's what I'm counting on.
L295026 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
L295025 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
L295024 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
L295023 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
L295022 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you.
L295021 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.
L295020 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
L295019 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ He's dead.
L294963 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ What an enchanting picture you paint of our future together.
L294962 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you.
L294959 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason.
L294958 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ Nice night.
L294957 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Good. I'll show you how, apey.
L294956 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ I want to be the way I was before.
L294955 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ You what?
L294954 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ But I like being human now.
L294953 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.
L294801 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ Very well.
L294800 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Very well.
L294782 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
L294781 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know.
L294773 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ Shan't happen again.
L294772 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ It's okay, Puff.
L294771 +++$+++ u1409 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ PUFF +++$+++ My apologies, madam.
L294946 +++$+++ u1410 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No you won't. But it's okay. You have stuff you gotta do.
L294945 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ I'll be in touch.
L294942 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ I'm really glad you two found each other.
L294941 +++$+++ u1410 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I like you so much, with or without hair.  But don't spread that around. Bad for business.
L294940 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Shut up, you.
L294939 +++$+++ u1410 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
L294938 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Oh, Rosie.
L294937 +++$+++ u1410 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I'm going to miss you.
L294936 +++$+++ u1410 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ With pleasure.
L294935 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.
L294908 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Ready!
L294907 +++$+++ u1410 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Done!
L294892 +++$+++ u1410 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Let's get you out of here. Come stay with me until you get your strength back.  Free electrolysis, if you want it! We'll get that face of yours cleared up in no time.
L294891 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Oh, Rosie.
L294890 +++$+++ u1410 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
L294889 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Why didn't your brother tell you that Nathan was having an affair?
L294888 +++$+++ u1410 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
L294887 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Your brother should have his license revoked.
L294886 +++$+++ u1410 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Nathan told my brother.
L294885 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ How'd you know where I was?
L294884 +++$+++ u1410 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Lila, I want to help you.
L294883 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Rose, please go away.
L294882 +++$+++ u1410 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Please, honey, let me in.
L294881 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Go the fuck away, Rosie.
L294880 +++$+++ u1410 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Lila, it's Rosie.
L294879 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob?
L294489 +++$+++ u1410 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Stand on a stepladder sometimes.
L294488 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ And I think I'm going to.
L294487 +++$+++ u1410 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yeah. My brother told me.
L294486 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
L294485 +++$+++ u1410 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Be still my crotch.
L294484 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Three foot one.
L294483 +++$+++ u1410 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh?
L294482 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ I have a friend you might like to meet.
L294481 +++$+++ u1410 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.
L294480 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
L294479 +++$+++ u1410 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
L294478 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
L294477 +++$+++ u1410 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No. I married a midget.
L294476 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ One night stand?
L294475 +++$+++ u1410 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.
L294474 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
L294473 +++$+++ u1410 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yeah?
L294472 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
L294471 +++$+++ u1410 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan.
L294431 +++$+++ u1410 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yeah. Says he likes you even more than he likes his own mother. And according to my brother Nathan's abormally close with his mother.
L294430 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ Really?
L294429 +++$+++ u1410 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ My brother says he likes you, too.
L294428 +++$+++ u1405 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ LILA +++$+++ I really like him, Rose. He's so...  ...passionate about his work.
L294427 +++$+++ u1410 +++$+++ m93 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ So?
