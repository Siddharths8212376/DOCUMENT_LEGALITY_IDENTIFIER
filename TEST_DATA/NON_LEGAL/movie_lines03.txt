L738 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ Yeah...
L737 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Kat a fan, too?
L736 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ Right.
L735 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Macbeth, right?
L733 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Oh yeah.
L732 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ You think?
L731 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ Yeah.  I guess.
L730 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Cool pictures.  You a fan?
L729 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ Hi.
L728 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
L777 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
L776 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Sweet love, renew thy force!
L775 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ You were right. She's still pissed.
L724 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
L723 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ So you got cozy with she who stings?
L437 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I'm likin' you guys better
L436 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
L429 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Yeah.
L428 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Ever been to Club Skunk?
L421 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Just for now.
L420 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
L415 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Good enough.
L414 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ What?!
L384 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ We're your guys.
L383 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
L382 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
L381 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ So Dorsey can get the girl?
L380 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
L379 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
L378 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
L377 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
L376 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
L375 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ What plan?
L373 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
L372 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What?
L371 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Say it
L512 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ See you next week!
L511 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ You're completely demented.
L264 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
L263 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
L262 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ What's to discuss?
L261 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
L259 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
L258 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Touch of the flu.
L257 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
L62 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ With the teeth of your zipper?
L61 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
L60 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
L59 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I missed you.
L933 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ That ' s what I thought
L932 +++$+++ u10 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Absolutely not.
L931 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Did I have anything to say about it?
L930 +++$+++ u10 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Your daughters went to the prom.
L929 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ What just happened?
L927 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ But -- who -- what --?
L926 +++$+++ u10 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Have a great time, honey!
L918 +++$+++ u10 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Dr. Ruth?
L917 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
L887 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
L886 +++$+++ u10 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
L877 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Pirate -- no question.
L876 +++$+++ u10 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
L193 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ You're not helping.
L192 +++$+++ u10 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Tumescent!
L191 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
L171 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
L170 +++$+++ u10 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ What's a synonym for throbbing?
L162 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Make anyone cry today?
L161 +++$+++ u10 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ In the microwave.
L2181 +++$+++ u12 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ALONSO +++$+++ Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
L2180 +++$+++ u23 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
L2179 +++$+++ u12 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ALONSO +++$+++ We should have seen land.
L2177 +++$+++ u23 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ We'll all go crazy...
L2176 +++$+++ u12 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ALONSO +++$+++ He's the devil's child...
L2175 +++$+++ u12 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ALONSO +++$+++ With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
L2174 +++$+++ u23 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
L2173 +++$+++ u12 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ALONSO +++$+++ What are you listening to, chicken ass?
L2172 +++$+++ u12 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ALONSO +++$+++ You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
L2171 +++$+++ u23 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ The water's going putrid in the barrels.
L2170 +++$+++ u12 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ALONSO +++$+++ I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
L2025 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
L2024 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
L2023 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
L2022 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
L2020 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
L2019 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
L2016 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
L2015 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ Is that all that interests you? Gold?
L2014 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
L2012 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ If they agree to follow me, yes.
L2011 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ Your life, and that of others!
L2010 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
L2006 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Excellency, you are right.
L2005 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
L1993 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
L1992 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I am, Your Eminence
L1991 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
L1990 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
L1989 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
L2524 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
L2523 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
L2522 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ You can see for yourself.
L2275 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
L2274 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
L2031 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
L2030 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
L2029 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
L2028 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ The Judgment is ours!
L2027 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
L2540 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
L2539 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ What is it, now?  Tell me...
L2538 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ I am busy inside.
L2537 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Can't you stay with us a little?
L2474 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
L2473 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ They took everything...
L2472 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ They tried... but I didn't let them.
L2471 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
L2320 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
L2319 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ You don't usually ask.
L2318 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
L2123 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ That's something you can't decide.
L2122 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I don't want you to wait for me.
L2121 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
L2119 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ Thank God...
L2118 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ She said yes.
L1986 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ I find that hard to believe.
L1985 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
L1984 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
L1983 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Are we going to argue?
L1982 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
L1981 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I haven't given you much of a life.
L1980 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ I know.
L1979 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I could be gone for years.
L2432 +++$+++ u15 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BOBADILLA +++$+++ I am afraid this is not the worst news.
L2431 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
L2430 +++$+++ u15 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BOBADILLA +++$+++ I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
L2429 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ How far from here?
L2426 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
L2425 +++$+++ u15 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BOBADILLA +++$+++ Viceroy of the West Indies.
L2424 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Appointment to what?
L2423 +++$+++ u15 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BOBADILLA +++$+++ My letters of appointment.
L2422 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Yes... I remember...
L2421 +++$+++ u15 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BOBADILLA +++$+++ Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
L2293 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
L2292 +++$+++ u15 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BOBADILLA +++$+++ May I ask by whom?
L2291 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
L2290 +++$+++ u15 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BOBADILLA +++$+++ I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
L2552 +++$+++ u17 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ FERNANDO +++$+++ Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
L2551 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
L2550 +++$+++ u17 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ FERNANDO +++$+++ I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
L2549 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ He never had one... except aboard my ships!
L2548 +++$+++ u17 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ FERNANDO +++$+++ He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
L2547 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ What does he say?
L2542 +++$+++ u17 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ FERNANDO +++$+++ I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
L2541 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ What are you listening to?
L2501 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ There must be a passage to that other ocean.
L2500 +++$+++ u17 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ FERNANDO +++$+++ Father...
L2485 +++$+++ u17 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ FERNANDO +++$+++ Not bad.
L2484 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ How are you feeling, Fernando?
L2440 +++$+++ u17 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ FERNANDO +++$+++ This time with me!
L2439 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I have to explore the mainland.
L2131 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
L2130 +++$+++ u17 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ FERNANDO +++$+++ Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
L2129 +++$+++ u17 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ FERNANDO +++$+++ You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
L2128 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ There'll be a time.
L2127 +++$+++ u17 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ FERNANDO +++$+++ I want to go with you!
L2469 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ All of them created by people like me.
L2468 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
L2467 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ What do you see?
L2466 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Look out of that window.
L2465 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
L2464 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Call them.
L2463 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ All I have to do is call the guards.
L2301 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
L2300 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ What...?  Do I have so many already?
L2299 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
L2297 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
L2296 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
L2295 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
L2287 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ ... for a commoner?
L2286 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ You defend yourself admirably...
L2282 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
L2281 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
L2110 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
L2109 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
L2108 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Then you are too ambitious.
L2107 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I'm not bargaining!
L2106 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
L2105 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ NO...!  I have waited too long, fought too hard.  Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit!  No... I will not be your servant!
L2104 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ No?
L2103 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ No...
L2410 +++$+++ u25 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ UTAPAN +++$+++ You never learned how to speak my language.
L2409 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
L2394 +++$+++ u25 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ UTAPAN +++$+++ You did the same to your God!
L2393 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
L2343 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Ask him if he will help.
L2342 +++$+++ u25 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ UTAPAN +++$+++ He understands.
L2341 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
L2260 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
L2259 +++$+++ u25 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ UTAPAN +++$+++ Chief says...
