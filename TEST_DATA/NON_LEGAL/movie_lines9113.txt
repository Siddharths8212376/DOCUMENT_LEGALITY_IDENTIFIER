L267453 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Um.
L267452 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ How all the magazines show tits today.
L267451 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ No.
L267450 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ You know what gets me?
L267449 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Home is important to a man.
L267448 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
L267447 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
L267446 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We'll see.
L267445 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
L267444 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Home, sweet home.
L267443 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I'm gonna wet my pants.
L267442 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
L267441 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
L267440 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We've never met.
L267439 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Didn't recognize you.
L267438 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ A bitch.
L267437 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ It's a bitch.
L267436 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Hm?
L267435 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I dunno, boy.
L267434 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Miss me, baby?
L268177 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Thank God!
L268176 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
L268175 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Out!
L268174 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew.
L268173 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Out!  Out!
L268172 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ You're my buddy.
L268171 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
L268170 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
L268169 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
L268168 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
L268167 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You're hollow, like a woman.
L268166 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I wouldn't drop my gun.
L268165 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
L268164 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Gee whiz--
L268163 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
L268162 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ What went wrong?
L268161 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ To make an ass of yourself.
L268160 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ You invited me.
L268159 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
L268158 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ For Africa.
L268157 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ For what?
L268156 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ We got to get another pilot.
L268155 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What?
L268154 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Who's going to fly our helicopter now?
L268124 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit!  Look after your things, your things!
L268123 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ If I were married to him, I sure wouldn't walk out.
L268118 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Things.  Oh--you silly people and your things.  Things, things, things.
L268117 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
L268116 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'm interested in long-term expectations.
L268115 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ You're making a joke.
L268114 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Fifty years?
L268085 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ That can be arranged.
L268084 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I just want one true adventure before I die.
L268083 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
L268082 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I've considered that.
L268081 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.
L268080 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Get used to it.  Back door, Paul.
L268079 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ What an awful sound!
L268077 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ You actually sold insurance!
L268076 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Insurance!
L268060 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Pass the fucking catsup.
L268059 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
L268058 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
L268057 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
L268056 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
L268049 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
L268048 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Blue soup.
L268047 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
L268046 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.
L268045 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Our pleasure.
L268044 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I can't get over how you guys are my friends.  Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper are my friends.
L268037 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Oh my God--  And you are Looseleaf Harper.
L268036 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I forget mine for years on end.
L268035 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
L268034 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You've come to the right man.
L268033 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I wanted to apologize.
L268032 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The posies are for her?
L268031 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Is Penelope in?
L268030 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ How are you, honeybunch?
L268029 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Hello.
L268251 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yeah.  But it's going to get loud again.
L268250 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'm talking to you gently now.
L268249 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't know what I hope.  But I don't think you care what I hope, anyway.  You don't know me.  You don't know her, either.  I don't think you know anybody.  You talk to everybody just the same.
L268241 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Everybody simply evaporates!  There are guest issues to be fought out here--or to be argued, at least. The enemy, the champion of all who oppose me, is in East St. Louis with his mother and his aunt!  I have so far done battle with a woman and a child and a violin.
L268240 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's your house, Dad.
L268239 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish I'd never come home!
L268238 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't want to fight you.
L268237 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Then speak, by God!  Can you fight with words?
L268219 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Too late!  It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me, are you?  Protect her!`
L268218 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Dad--
L268217 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
L268216 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Gee whiz, Dad--
L268215 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
L268214 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it.
L268213 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Open the bolt!
L268212 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No.
L268211 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
L268210 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No.
L268209 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ That's a rifle you have?
L268208 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Nothing.
L268207 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What's this?
L268206 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What's this?
L268205 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Mom?
L268088 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's Mom.
L268087 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Who was it?
L268086 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Dad?
L268055 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You're free to go to her, if you want.  If you'd rather be a woman and run with the women, just say the word.
L268054 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No.
L268053 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We've got to do something to make this boy's voice change.  I wonder if we couldn't get bull balls somewhere, and fry 'em up.  Still miss your mother?
L268052 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'm a man.
L267913 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
L267912 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What kind of exercise?
L267862 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Leave a tip.
L267861 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ A hundred dollars for breakfast?
L267860 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
L267859 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Dad--
L267844 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Make it fast.
L267843 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Can I get dressed first?
L267842 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The smallest thing I've got.
L267841 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ A hundred dollars!
L267838 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
L267837 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Play?
L267755 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Mom?
L267754 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Damn.
L267753 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!
L267748 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Scat!
L267747 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
L267746 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Will you go to bed?
L267745 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
L267744 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Penelope!
L267743 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
L267742 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Penelope!
L267741 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
L267740 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
L267739 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
L267738 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Can't it keep till morning?
L267737 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
L267736 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I can't take my eyes off you.
L267735 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Why don't you go to bed--son.
L267734 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
L267733 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
L267732 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
L267731 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
L267683 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Sir?
L267682 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home.
L267630 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Go ahead.  No, no, no, no.
L267629 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
L267628 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No, no, no, no, no.
L267627 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You're a very good boy to respond that way.
L267626 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
L267625 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
L267624 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ They're not engaged.
L267623 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
L267622 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
L267621 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You're supposed to get hurt!
L267620 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
L267619 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
L267618 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Sir?
L267617 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
L267616 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
L267615 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
L267614 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Mhravitch.
L267613 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Mhravitch.  Remember that name.
L267611 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia."
L267610 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
L267609 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Where did you get the poison?
L267608 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
L267607 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Go on.
L267606 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
L267605 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't know.
L267604 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
L267603 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Uck.
L267602 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
L267601 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Mhravitch.
L267600 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
L267599 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Wow.
L267598 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia.
L267597 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Tell me that!  Tell me that!
L267596 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.
L267595 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Tell me that.
L267594 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
L267593 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ "The sting."
L267592 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more.

L267590 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."
