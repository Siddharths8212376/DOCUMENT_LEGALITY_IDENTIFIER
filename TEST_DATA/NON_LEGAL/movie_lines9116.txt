L267827 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.
L267820 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You were wrong, you quack!
L267819 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I thought she was a widow.
L267815 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when Looseleaf and I start flying in pacqualinincheewa root.  I can hear the Alice-sit-by- the-fires now: "We discovered it in the Amazon Rain Forest.  Now we cure you with it.  Now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks."
L267814 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Good Lord.
L267809 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Everything about you is the editorial we.  Take that away from you, and you'd disappear.
L267808 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
L267807 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We have, have we?
L267806 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
L267805 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Wasn't that sweet of me?
L267800 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Hundreds.
L267799 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Are you've seen it work cures?
L267798 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
L267797 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I've never heard of it.
L267796 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
L267795 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Would you say that again?
L267794 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Pacqualinincheewa root.
L267793 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I was going to ask.
L267792 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure.
L267791 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Chills, fevers, sweats.  You can describe it and name it after yourself: "the Woodly galloping crud."
L267790 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ You have chills?
L267789 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
L267788 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ You've been bitten by bats?
L267787 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
L267786 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps?
L267782 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What a brilliant diagnosis!
L267781 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Ah!  You're ambulatory!
L267729 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Good night.
L267728 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fiancé is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
L267727 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ None.
L267726 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--
L267725 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I feel the same way.  What next?
L267714 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ She's crying because she's so happy.
L267713 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Are--are you crying, Penelope?
L267712 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.
L267711 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
L267710 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
L267706 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I came back.
L267705 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Safe and sound, I see.  Oh--you came back.
L267433 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I won't try to keep up with you. I'm not as fast on my feet as I once was.
L267432 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I've literally got to run!
L267431 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.
L267430 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I've got to run!
L267429 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ And her fiancé!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
L267428 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ And her fiancé!
L267427 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all?
L267426 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Yes!  Please!  You've got to get out right now!
L267425 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
L267424 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
L267423 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
L267422 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
L267421 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ She still has just the one child-- the boy?
L267420 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Will you please go?  An emergency!
L267419 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
L267418 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ She's fine.  Please--
L267417 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Ahh--then she's still alive.
L267416 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later.
L267415 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I'm a neighbor.  I have the apartment across the hall.  I have to go to the hospital now.  An emergency.
L267414 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
L267413 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
L267412 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We'll miss you so.
L267411 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.
L267410 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Call her back--tell her to head for the hospital.  Tell the hospital to expect her.  I'll leave right now.
L267409 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Oh dear.
L267408 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ ...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
L267407 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Hello, Mother.
L267406 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother.
L267404 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Dead!  Such a final word.  Dead!  Did you hear that?
L267403 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ He's dead, you know.
L267402 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We tried to be.  We tried to be.
L267401 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
L267400 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ But here you are inside, aren't you?
L267399 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ It's always locked.
L267398 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?
L267393 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ You startled me.
L267392 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Gentlemen--that's nice.
L267391 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
L267390 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Ooops.
L267389 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Ooops.
L268153 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I dunno.  Marry the first whore who's nice to me, I guess.  Get a job in a motorcycle shop.  So long, you guys.
L268152 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ What will you do, Colonel?
L268151 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ So long, you guys.
L268126 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I dunno.
L268125 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ And you, Colonel?  Let me guess: You don't know.
L267895 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?
L267894 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ How horrible.
L267893 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
L267892 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ What happened?
L267891 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
L267890 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Who's dead?
L267889 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
L267888 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ For what?
L267887 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
L267886 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Alice is dead?
L267885 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Jesus.
L267884 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Dead!
L267881 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought it was some foreign language.
L267880 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
L267879 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ There was so much going on.
L267878 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You didn't even find that out?
L267877 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ She did?
L267876 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Alice got married again.
L267873 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
L267872 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ And you went home unannounced, too?
L267177 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Thank you.  You can leave now.  We'll begin.
L267176 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ It was a bitch.
L267175 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You don't know?
L267174 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I dunno, boy.
L267173 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.
L267172 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Jesus--I dunno.  You know.  What the heck.  Who knows?
L268009 +++$+++ u1242 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ MILDRED +++$+++ Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink.
L268008 +++$+++ u1247 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WANDA JUNE +++$+++ Won't you please join our club? Please?
L268007 +++$+++ u1242 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ MILDRED +++$+++ That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
L268006 +++$+++ u1247 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WANDA JUNE +++$+++ I'm only ten years old.
L268005 +++$+++ u1242 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ MILDRED +++$+++ Thought you were another wife, maybe.
L268004 +++$+++ u1247 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WANDA JUNE +++$+++ Mr. Ryan just borrowed my birthday cake.  I don't really know him.
L268016 +++$+++ u1242 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ MILDRED +++$+++ Never mind.  It's a dumb theory.  I was going to say it was all sexual..but everything is sexual...but alcohol.  Peace.
L268015 +++$+++ u1246 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ VON KONIGSWALD +++$+++ Ja?
L268014 +++$+++ u1242 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ MILDRED +++$+++ Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
L268013 +++$+++ u1246 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ VON KONIGSWALD +++$+++ That is sad.
L268012 +++$+++ u1246 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ VON KONIGSWALD +++$+++ Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids.  Any little kids.
L268011 +++$+++ u1242 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ MILDRED +++$+++ Premature ejaculation.
L268010 +++$+++ u1246 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ VON KONIGSWALD +++$+++ Because he was cruel?
L268003 +++$+++ u1242 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ MILDRED +++$+++ Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
L268002 +++$+++ u1246 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ VON KONIGSWALD +++$+++ You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
L268001 +++$+++ u1242 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ MILDRED +++$+++ Yes.
L268000 +++$+++ u1246 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ VON KONIGSWALD +++$+++ You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
L267999 +++$+++ u1242 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ MILDRED +++$+++ I heard you were looking for me.
L267998 +++$+++ u1246 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ VON KONIGSWALD +++$+++ Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right?
L267661 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
L267660 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No.
L267659 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
L267658 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Don't touch me.
L267645 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ The wife of Harold Ryan is going to marry a pansy next?  This is the end of Western Civilization as far as I'm concerned.  You must be crazy as a fruitcake.
L267644 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'll kill myself.
L267643 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I feel like I want to yell my head off--just yell anything.  Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!
L267642 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't want to live any more.
L267641 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ That goes double for me.
L267632 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ What a relief!
L267631 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Thank God!
L267317 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too.
L267316 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I worship your father.  That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot?  It's the proudest thing in my apartment.
L267313 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?
L267312 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
L267311 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here.
L267310 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
L267309 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Don't!
L267308 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ What's this?
L267307 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
L267306 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Kid--kid--
L267305 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
L267304 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
L267303 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
L267302 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?
L267301 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Don't worry about it.
L267300 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Something's made you sore.
L267299 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't care what she wears.
L267298 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ She's my date tonight.  What do you want her to do--bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump?  Bugger off!  Ask Paul what he thinks.  Your mother looks beautiful--right?  Kid?  Doesn't your mother look nice?  Paul?
L267766 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Okay.
L267765 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Then get him.
L267764 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yeah.
L267763 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ It is an emergency, isn't it?
L267762 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Really?
L267759 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ He can hardly talk.
L267758 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ What does he say to do?
L267757 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
L267756 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ What are his symptoms?
L267716 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?
L267715 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ That's why I'm crying.
L267681 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ It is you, isn't it, Harold?
L267680 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't get it.
L267679 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
L267678 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What?
L267677 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ That man is your father.
L267676 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Mom?
