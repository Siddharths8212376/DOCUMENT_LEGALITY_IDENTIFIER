L419687 +++$+++ u2313 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
L419686 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Give me another double brandy.
L419893 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Suspicions... nothing but suspicions!... That's the trouble with you! If you don't let me in I'll stand in front of this office of yours and warn people to keep away from Russia!... I'll picket your whole country....
L419892 +++$+++ u2315 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ Or a tunnel or a bridge...
L419891 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ What for... why?
L419890 +++$+++ u2315 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ How do I know you don't want to blow up a factory?
L419889 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ On what?
L419888 +++$+++ u2315 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ Why should I take a chance?
L419887 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
L419886 +++$+++ u2315 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ You're going to force us... huh?
L419885 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
L419884 +++$+++ u2315 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ Oh no. No visa.
L419883 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I must get into that country of yours!
L419882 +++$+++ u2315 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ No visa.
L419881 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yes!
L419880 +++$+++ u2315 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
L419879 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
L419878 +++$+++ u2315 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ I think so too.
L419877 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
L419876 +++$+++ u2315 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ But you had!
L419875 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!
L419874 +++$+++ u2315 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
L419873 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ She must have her little joke.  You're not going to take that seriously.
L419863 +++$+++ u2315 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ You believe in our cause?
L419862 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
L419861 +++$+++ u2315 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
L419860 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Confess what?
L419859 +++$+++ u2315 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
L419858 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Private.
L419857 +++$+++ u2315 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ What business?
L419856 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Business.
L419855 +++$+++ u2315 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
L419854 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Don't hold that against me... please!
L419853 +++$+++ u2315 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
L419852 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
L419851 +++$+++ u2315 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ Not always... look at me... I've been back twice. 
L419850 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Pardon me, I am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to Russia -- if they don't like what he has done they put him out of the way?
L420107 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Well, when it is a choice between my personal interest and the good of my country, how can I waver? No one shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian.
L420106 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
L420105 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
L420104 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I won't tell you what came between... I'll prove it. It will take a long time, Ninotchka... at least a lifetime.
L420103 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
L420102 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
L420101 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
L420100 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
L419747 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ So happy and so tired.
L419746 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yes, sweetheart. 
L419745 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon?
L419744 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Please.
L419743 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
L419742 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ It is their wish.
L419741 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Is this the wish of the masses?
L419740 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I give them back to the people...  I make you Ninotchka the Great... Duchess of the People!... Grand Duchess of the People!
L419739 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ They belong to the people.
L419738 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on you. You will teach these jewels. For the first time they will learn how they can look.
L419736 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Now, darling, don't get impatient, wait until we are married. You know that worthless butler of mine... that reactionary? Some day when I come home to you I may say, "Darling, I drove Gaston to the market and look what I got from him!"
L419735 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.
L419734 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Who cried that one?
L419733 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ ...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
L419732 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ ...but big.
L419731 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....
L419730 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ But I can throw it out of the window.
L419729 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....
L419728 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ No, no music.
L419727 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ No music.
L419725 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Well, it has to warm up... you have to give it a chance... just like people... like you and me... first you wanted to fight me and now we belong to the same party... salute!
L419724 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ It's dead.
L419723 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...
L419722 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
L419721 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
L419720 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ What shall we get? The news!
L419718 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Oh yes, yes. It has a little knob that turns... a little knob... it must be somewhere around here... yes... here... I see...
L419717 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
L419716 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Radio! What is radio?
L419715 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Let's turn on the radio.
L419714 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I have paid the penalty. Now let's have some music.
L419713 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ All right.
L419712 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Much happier.
L419711 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Would that make you any happier?
L419710 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Everyone wants to confess and if they don't confess they make them confess. I am a traitor. When I kissed you I betrayed the Russian ideal. Leon, I should be stood up against the wall.
L419709 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I know... it's the Russian soul.
L419708 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I am so happy. No one can be so happy without being punished. I will be punished and I should be punished.  I want to confess, darling.
L419707 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yes... a kiss... salute!
L419706 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Our salute will be a kiss.
L419705 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ No! No!
L419704 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ ...and we won't clench our fist...
L419703 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ No! No!
L419702 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ And we won't stretch up our arms...
L419701 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Right: Lovers of the world unite!
L419700 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
L419699 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ All right, we'll make it red.
L419698 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Not white, darling.
L419697 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yes... a little white house.
L419696 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Are we going to build our little house?
L419695 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ No. Nobody will find us.
L419694 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.
L419683 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ And I adore you, Ninotchua.
L419682 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I love you, my little Leonitchka!
L419681 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ No speech.
L419680 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ No speech?
L419679 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
L419678 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them.
L419677 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Now, Ninotchka... please!
L419676 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Comrades! Good people of France!
L419675 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ But, darling, you can't do that.
L419674 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Don't shush me. I am People! I want to make a speech. I want to overthrow the Duchess!
L419673 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Shhh! Shhh!
L419672 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I must talk to my brothers!
L419671 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Darling, darling... please!
L419670 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Comrades! Comrades!
L419669 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yes. Don't worry. Everything will be all right.
L419668 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Thursday.
L419667 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ What, darling?
L419666 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
L419665 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
L419664 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.
L419662 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ To the loveliest story I ever heard.
L419661 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ You must, darling.
L419660 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
L419659 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
L419658 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Go on.
L419657 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.
L419656 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
L419655 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ A funny story?
L419654 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
L419629 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ And General Savitzky.
L419628 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ How do you do?
L419612 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast.  To us, Ninotchka!
L419611 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?
L419609 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.
L419608 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.
L419607 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.
L419606 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.
L419569 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ My darling.
L419568 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.
L419567 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Ninotchka, you're jealous.
L419566 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
L419565 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Ninotchka, I love you.
L419564 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ She is very attractive. She has great elegance.  She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
L419562 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ When I was here before I noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame. I thought what a waste of silver. That's all that interested me then. Now I would like to know... what happened to the woman?
L419561 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I don't think so.
L419560 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Did you make any change in this room?
L419559 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I promise... I swear.
L419558 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
L419557 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Anything, Ninotchka.
L419556 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Leon, I would like to ask you something.
L419554 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it...
L419553 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ No... go on.
L419552 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative?
L419551 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ You see I couldn't shout that.
L419548 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves.
L419547 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
L419546 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?
L419545 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, "What are your plans for this evening, madame?"
L419544 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ It's nine o'clock.
L419543 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Twelve seventy-five from the Clarence? The son-of-a-gun made a detour!...  But he got you here.
L419542 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ For twelve francs, seventy-five.
L419541 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ You see? Life can be so simple.
L419540 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am.
L419539 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ You remember this room?
L419538 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Foolish? If this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself I would follow it from one end of Paris to the other, and when I caught up with it I would say, "Just a moment, you charming little dress, I want you to meet Ninotchka... you two were meant for each other." Ninotchka feels more comfortable.
L419537 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I don't look too foolish?
L419491 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Well, so far it isn't funny, but wait. He says to the waiter, "Waiter! Bring me a cup of coffee." So the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee."...  Wait a minute... wait a minute... I'm all mixed up...  A man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, "Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee without cream," and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk!"
L419490 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Yes.
L419489 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
L419488 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Yes.
L419487 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?
L419486 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ So you don't think that's funny? It is funny! Everyone else thinks so! Maybe you didn't get it.
L419485 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ No.
L419484 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Not funny, huh?
L419482 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Maybe you haven't any sense of humor. Well, I'll give you one more chance! Now listen!
L419481 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I don't think so.
L419480 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
L419479 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ No.
L419478 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I suppose you don't think that's funny?
L419477 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ So do I.  Now, here's a great one... Ha! Ha! Ha!  Well, maybe it's not so good. Let's forget it! How's this? Two men are looking at the moon. One says to the other, "Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?" "Yes, it is," says the other, "five hundred million." "Whew!" replies the first, "they must get pretty crowded when it's half moon!" Ha! Ha! Ha!
L419476 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I wish they had never met.
L419475 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. McIntosh?"...
L419474 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I have never heard one.
L419473 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Do you like Scotch stories?
L419472 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Probably not.
L419471 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
L419470 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ On which boat?
L419469 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
L419468 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Ha! Ha! Now go back.
L419467 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ No, I can't leave you. I won't. Not yet. Not until I've made you laugh... at least once.
L419466 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Then you should go back to your table.
L419465 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Because we are an odd couple.
L419464 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Why?
L419463 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
L419462 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ At what?
L419461 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Just smile.
L419460 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Why?
L419459 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Will you smile?
L419458 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ What?
L419457 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
L419456 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
L419455 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
L419454 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
