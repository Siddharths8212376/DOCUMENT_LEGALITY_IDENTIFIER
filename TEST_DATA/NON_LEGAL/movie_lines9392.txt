L518453 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya died.  Killed herself.  I'm different.
L518452 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L518449 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Stop.
L518448 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ You don't love me.
L518447 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ What's wrong.
L518443 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ I'm glad.
L518442 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Yes.  Yes.
L518441 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Do I really feel like... I am...?
L518440 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ It was obvious from the way he first looked at me.
L518439 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
L518438 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
L518437 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
L518436 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ He has a point.
L518435 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Well.  He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.
L518434 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Sartorius wants to destroy it.
L518433 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth.  This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
L518432 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ What does Snow think you should do?
L518430 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
L518429 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
L518426 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ You know, I've decided: I'm just gonna believe what you believe about this whole Solaris thing, it'll make life so much easier; the little wife agreeing with her big, strong husband. You must get such a headache thinking about those Great Big Problems all day.
L518425 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ How could she not be real?  I can smell her, taste her.  She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
L518424 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ I like that too.
L518423 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Good.  Because I want you to know. I really like fucking you.
L518422 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ I think so.
L518421 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
L518411 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
L518410 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
L518407 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ I don't know.  I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.
L518406 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Why did you say those things?
L518402 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ You don't know?
L518401 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ What happened to us, exactly?
L518398 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ I did too.
L518397 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.
L518395 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ I know.  I know.  We don't have to talk about that.
L518394 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up.  I was a threat.  Now I know why.  She was afraid she'd be seen.  That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right?  I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on.  I guess that's part of the reason why --
L518393 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ What kind of look?
L518392 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
L518391 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ How old were you?
L518390 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger.  Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states.  Time would just collapse, I would be inside time.  I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped.  Freaky stuff.
L518388 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ I been thinking about how much I hate you.
L518387 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Where've you been?
L518359 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ When I saw you were gone I got scared.
L518358 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
L518357 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ What happened?
L518348 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ As I said, then it's God, right?
L518347 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
L518346 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
L518345 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ You're talking about a man in a white beard again.  You're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human.  Human beings look for causes and patterns.  How could we know what Solaris is up to, if anything?
L518344 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
L518343 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!
L518342 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ You still don't believe in God?
L518341 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ It's something.
L518340 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Then it's God, right?
L518339 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
L518338 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Is it intelligent?
L518337 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
L518336 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Is it a planet?
L518335 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Yes.  But not until you mentioned them.  As soon as you said those things, I remembered them.  And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember.  It's like filling up.
L518334 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
L518333 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ What do you mean?
L518332 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ What do you remember?
L518330 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ All right.  How about I feel better when you take them?
L518329 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
L518328 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ You're better when you take them.
L518326 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ You talk like an actor.
L518325 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
L518324 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ You go home.
L518323 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Let's go home.
L518322 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
L518321 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Rheya.  Not here.
L518320 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ You behave as though you want to fuck her.
L518319 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Stop it.
L518318 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ You want to fuck her?
L518316 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Better.
L518315 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ And tonight?
L518314 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ I wasn't.
L518313 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ You didn't look very happy.
L518312 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Not a very happy poem.
L518311 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ My Thomas is a little rusty.
L518310 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
L518309 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Book?
L518308 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ "And Death Shall Have No Dominion".
L518307 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ I want you inside me right now.
L518306 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Rheya...
L518272 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Yes.
L518271 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ We're taking a flight?
L518270 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ To calm my anxiety.
L518269 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ To calm your anxiety.
L518268 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ What are they?
L518266 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ I'll be right back.
L518265 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ I don't know.  I can't be alone.
L518264 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Why?
L518263 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Don't.
L518262 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ I'll just be a minute.
L518261 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ I'll go with you.
L518260 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ I need to see Snow.
L518253 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Yes.
L518252 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Oh, God.  I'm awake.
L518683 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ You go ahead.  Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now.  Everything's a blur.  I like distinctions.
L518682 +++$+++ u2849 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SARTORIUS +++$+++ You want it coming back with us?
L518676 +++$+++ u2849 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SARTORIUS +++$+++ Fuck me.  I knew it.
L518675 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ I got rid of him.  I wanted to see if... I wanted to be the only one. I wanted to be Snow.
L518674 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ I'm not Snow.
L518673 +++$+++ u2849 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SARTORIUS +++$+++ Snow, get up here, now.
L518472 +++$+++ u2849 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SARTORIUS +++$+++ Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
L518471 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ Gibarian was under enormous --
L518380 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
L518379 +++$+++ u2849 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SARTORIUS +++$+++ Followed by non-human manifestations.
L518378 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.
L518377 +++$+++ u2849 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SARTORIUS +++$+++ A recoil, with no compensating mechanism.
L518373 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ It's an experiment.
L518372 +++$+++ u2849 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SARTORIUS +++$+++ They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.
L518368 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ We want to talk freely.
L518367 +++$+++ u2849 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SARTORIUS +++$+++ We thought you'd be alone.  We want to talk about...
L518365 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ He won't.
L518364 +++$+++ u2849 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SARTORIUS +++$+++ Why do you say that?
L518363 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ He won't do it.
L522001 +++$+++ u2862 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ WIN +++$+++ Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek.
L522000 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Occasionally.
L521999 +++$+++ u2862 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ WIN +++$+++ You still writing the occasional magazine article?
L521998 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's terrific Win.
L521996 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's called "solid"... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win.
L521995 +++$+++ u2862 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ WIN +++$+++ Looks a little constipated to me.
L521994 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You didn't like him?
L521993 +++$+++ u2862 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ WIN +++$+++ And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
L521992 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ They've got two monsters now.  Both boys.
L521991 +++$+++ u2862 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ WIN +++$+++ Skiddy and Kit?  I haven't seen them since that shitty pasta dinner on the cape.
L521985 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Hello, Win.
L521984 +++$+++ u2862 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ WIN +++$+++ Claire!
L522662 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ You take care.
L522661 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Say goodbye, Mike.
L522660 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I do.
L522659 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
L522658 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I like your coat.
L522656 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Listen, I'll... see you again.
L522655 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'll miss you, Mike.
L522653 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I think it's probably still a good idea.
L522652 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ You don't have to, now.
L522651 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't know...
L522650 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ You still going away?
L522649 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ So.
L522648 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ So.
L522647 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Yeah.  It's all over.
L522646 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Everyone's all right...?
L522615 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Mike...?
L522614 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Claire!
L522583 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy.
L522582 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ ... Mike.
L522569 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Yeah...
L522568 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.
L522567 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ "To"... Forget about you.
L522566 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ "For"...?
L522565 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Long enough.
L522564 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ How long you going away for?
L522563 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ ... Don't explain.
L522562 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I'd miss my life...
L522561 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I know.
L522560 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ It wouldn't work.
L522559 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I know.
L522558 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I've been doing a lot of thinking.
L522557 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Yeah.
L522556 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ They guys treatin' you all right?
L522555 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Let's do it.
L522554 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Pretty bad.
L522553 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Do you?
L522552 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Do you dance?
L522551 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What a memory.
L522517 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I'll think about Wednesday.
L522516 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
L522515 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Claire...
L522514 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Listen, you're right.  Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay?
L522513 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart.
L522512 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
L522511 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in Queens.
L522510 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't know.  Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
L522509 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ When can I see you?
L522508 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
L522507 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Where?
L522506 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'm going away after that, the next morning.
L522505 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Oh that thing in Queens.
L522504 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come...
L522503 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular "marching band".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --
L522502 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Are you okay?
L522501 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Oh God, that's great!
L522500 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
L522499 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
L522498 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ You don't want to know.
L522469 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I don't know.
L522468 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What do you want to do?
L522467 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Not exactly.
L522466 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You told her?
L522421 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Okay, then let's make it easy.  It was a mistake.  Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it.
L522420 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  A fuckin' joke?
L522419 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
L522418 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I don't know you...
L522417 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ She's okay.  Everything's okay...
L522416 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ They called here after you left...
L522415 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Yeah.
L522393 +++$+++ u2851 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
L522392 +++$+++ u2856 +++$+++ m188 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I do care about you!
