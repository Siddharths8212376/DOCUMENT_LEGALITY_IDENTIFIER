L432391 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Of course I do.
L432390 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ You love me then?
L432389 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
L432388 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?
L432339 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ Maybe so.
L432338 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ <i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
L432337 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
L432336 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ All right.  Put it on heavy.
L432335 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
L432334 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I don't know, yet.  We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.
L432333 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ What can we do against them?
L432332 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free.  Be careful--Don't change your expression too much.  They must not catch on.
L432311 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ ...And I thought you loved me.
L432310 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
L432309 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ That sudden?
L432308 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ I should hope not.  I hate you!
L432307 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
L432306 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
L432305 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ You're talking nonsense.
L432304 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ Yes I feel it in my bones.
L432303 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ You do?
L432302 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.
L432301 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
L432300 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
L432299 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
L432298 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ Nothing is worth your life.
L432297 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I am--It's our only chance.
L432296 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ Be careful!
L432295 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ The ropes are coming loose.
L432237 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Whatever you do, don't do that.
L432236 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ I'm afraid I'll faint.
L432235 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic won't do us any good!  Let me think. We've got to stall for time.
L432234 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I don't know.  I just don't know. But don't give up. We're not finished yet.
L432233 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ What can we do?
L432232 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Don't let them hear you.
L432231 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ Those creatures..!
L432230 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ You've got a right to be. We're trapped by a bunch of fiends.
L432229 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ I'm so frightened.
L432207 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Be careful!--They'll see you.
L432206 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ Look!
L432204 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!
L432203 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ What do you mean?
L432202 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I'm not sure...
L432201 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ Can't we get out of here?
L432200 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.  Nothing alive looks like that!
L432199 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ Could it be some kind of college initiation?
L432198 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Well, it's probably just the caretaker, and that's exactly who we want to find.  They'll have a telephone.  C'mon.
L432197 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
L432196 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Not dead?  In a cemetery?
L432195 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
L432194 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
L432193 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
L432192 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Something's making that music.
L432191 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
L432190 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
L432189 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ Then..then what's that music?
L432188 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
L432187 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ It frightens me.
L432186 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ In there.
L432185 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ Where?
L432184 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.
L432171 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Okay.
L432170 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!
L432169 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ There's an old cemetery on this road. I've been there before.
L432168 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back.
L432167 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ All of my books are based on fact, or legend.  Thats perhaps why they're more interesting and sell in the top spots.
L432166 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Who's to say my monsters aren't alive?
L432165 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ That's life.  My kisses are alive.
L432164 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
L432162 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
L432161 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
L432160 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Sure there are--and I've tried them all.  Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.  Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
L432159 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
L432158 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
L432157 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ But does it have to be in a cemetery?
L432156 +++$+++ u6968 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
L432155 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.
L432376 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Now hurry, hurry.  I will watch!  Your desires may be my pleasure also...Our fitting climax to an evening's enter- tainment.  You must...hurry now.
L432375 +++$+++ u6970 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ PRINCESS OF DARKNESS +++$+++ Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
L432374 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ You better hope there is.
L432373 +++$+++ u6970 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ PRINCESS OF DARKNESS +++$+++ Is there time?
L432372 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ You may take her now.
L432371 +++$+++ u6970 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ PRINCESS OF DARKNESS +++$+++ You mean...!
L432370 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Your pleasures of course!
L432369 +++$+++ u6970 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ PRINCESS OF DARKNESS +++$+++ For what!?!
L432368 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ The time...is short.
L432367 +++$+++ u6970 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ PRINCESS OF DARKNESS +++$+++ All others were but infinitessimal bits of fluff, compared to <i>her</i>  This one would have <i>died</i> for feathers, furs, and fluff...and so she did!
L432366 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>
L432365 +++$+++ u6970 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ PRINCESS OF DARKNESS +++$+++ Oh, if there is only time!
L432364 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
L432363 +++$+++ u6970 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ PRINCESS OF DARKNESS +++$+++ The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
L432362 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Then cancel my order.
L432361 +++$+++ u6970 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ PRINCESS OF DARKNESS +++$+++ You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
L432360 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ I will decide the conclusion.
L432359 +++$+++ u6970 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ PRINCESS OF DARKNESS +++$+++ The moon sinks lower into the hills!  We must hurry to the finish.
L432356 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Well then let us proceed.
L432355 +++$+++ u6970 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ PRINCESS OF DARKNESS +++$+++ There are others.
L432354 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
L432353 +++$+++ u6970 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ PRINCESS OF DARKNESS +++$+++ I understand, Master
L432352 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
L432351 +++$+++ u6970 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ PRINCESS OF DARKNESS +++$+++ I would have time for my own pleasures!
L432350 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
L432349 +++$+++ u6970 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ PRINCESS OF DARKNESS +++$+++ At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
L432348 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Ahh, there is yet time.
L432347 +++$+++ u6970 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ PRINCESS OF DARKNESS +++$+++ The moon is almost gone!
L432346 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
L432345 +++$+++ u6970 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ PRINCESS OF DARKNESS +++$+++ When!?
L432344 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Ahh, she will be yours.
L432343 +++$+++ u6970 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ PRINCESS OF DARKNESS +++$+++ Well?
L432329 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ The Princess of Darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain.  Yet I am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient. I have but to touch you with my finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly...
L432328 +++$+++ u6970 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ PRINCESS OF DARKNESS +++$+++ She is to be <b>mine!</b>  It is so spoken!
L432291 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Ahh, but I declare there is still time for <i>some</i>thing.
L432290 +++$+++ u6970 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ PRINCESS OF DARKNESS +++$+++ It would seem so, Master
L432289 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
L432288 +++$+++ u6970 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ PRINCESS OF DARKNESS +++$+++ At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
L432287 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Yes, yes yes I know all that.
L432262 +++$+++ u6970 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ PRINCESS OF DARKNESS +++$+++ As you wish, Master
L432261 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
L432260 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ She pleases me.  Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes. 
L432251 +++$+++ u6970 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ PRINCESS OF DARKNESS +++$+++ It would seem so, Master.
L432250 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
L432249 +++$+++ u6970 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ PRINCESS OF DARKNESS +++$+++ As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
L432248 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ She was?
L432246 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Her dance has pleased me.
L432245 +++$+++ u6970 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ PRINCESS OF DARKNESS +++$+++ El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country.
L432244 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ She came to us on the Day of the Dead.
L432243 +++$+++ u6970 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ PRINCESS OF DARKNESS +++$+++ She loved the bull ring and the matador.  She danced to their destruction. Now she dances to her own destruction.  Her dance is of skulls.
L432242 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ What kind of symbol?
L432241 +++$+++ u6970 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ PRINCESS OF DARKNESS +++$+++ A symbol, Master.
L432240 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ ...And what is this?
L432223 +++$+++ u6970 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ PRINCESS OF DARKNESS +++$+++ Tie them that they may watch.
L432222 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ A situation easily remedied.
L432221 +++$+++ u6970 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ PRINCESS OF DARKNESS +++$+++ But they are not yet one of us.
L432294 +++$+++ u6972 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ THE MUMMY +++$+++ Yes, sir, Master.
L432293 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest.
L432292 +++$+++ u6972 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ THE MUMMY +++$+++ There are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, Master
L432284 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ You are the keepers of the Damned.  You two know them all. And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment. I want...a decided change.
L432283 +++$+++ u6972 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ THE MUMMY +++$+++ Then it is some service you desire of us.
L432282 +++$+++ u6972 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ THE MUMMY +++$+++ Aaaahhhh.
L432281 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
L432280 +++$+++ u6972 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ THE MUMMY +++$+++ It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
L432279 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Then why do you shake so?
L432278 +++$+++ u6972 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ THE MUMMY +++$+++ We don't know of anything, Master...
L432277 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ You know better than that.
L432276 +++$+++ u6972 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ THE MUMMY +++$+++ Have we in some way made you angry, Master?
L432218 +++$+++ u6972 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ THE MUMMY +++$+++ Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.
L432217 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Live ones where only the dead should be?
L432216 +++$+++ u6972 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ THE MUMMY +++$+++ Yes, Master.
L432215 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ They are live ones?
L432331 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
L432330 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ No. No! No!
L432321 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ You need not worry...Not just now, anyway.
L432320 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
L432319 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
L432318 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
L432183 +++$+++ u6971 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ I'm so frightened.
L432182 +++$+++ u6969 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ CRISWELL +++$+++ Ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin!  May it ever be so adventurous!
L432342 +++$+++ u6972 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ THE MUMMY +++$+++ Without the snake, of course.
L432341 +++$+++ u6973 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ THE WOLF MAN +++$+++ Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
L432340 +++$+++ u6972 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ THE MUMMY +++$+++ I could make her another Cleopatra...
L432271 +++$+++ u6972 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ THE MUMMY +++$+++ I can't remember doing anything wrong either.
L432270 +++$+++ u6973 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ THE WOLF MAN +++$+++ Aannnnaahhnn.
L432269 +++$+++ u6972 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ THE MUMMY +++$+++ Did you howl off-key at the moon again?
L432268 +++$+++ u6973 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ THE WOLF MAN +++$+++ Aannnnaahhnn.
L432267 +++$+++ u6972 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ THE MUMMY +++$+++ Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
L432266 +++$+++ u6973 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ THE WOLF MAN +++$+++ Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
L432265 +++$+++ u6972 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ THE MUMMY +++$+++ What do you suppose for?
L432264 +++$+++ u6973 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ THE WOLF MAN +++$+++ Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
L432263 +++$+++ u6972 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ THE MUMMY +++$+++ He wants us.
L432259 +++$+++ u6973 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ THE WOLF MAN +++$+++ Aaarrrgggaahh.
L432258 +++$+++ u6972 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ THE MUMMY +++$+++ When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
L432257 +++$+++ u6973 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ THE WOLF MAN +++$+++ Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
L432256 +++$+++ u6972 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ THE MUMMY +++$+++ We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky things.
L432255 +++$+++ u6973 +++$+++ m466 +++$+++ THE WOLF MAN +++$+++ Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.
