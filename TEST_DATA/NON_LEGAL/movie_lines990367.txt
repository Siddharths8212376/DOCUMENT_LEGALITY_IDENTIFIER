L557215 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Turn on the light.
L557214 +++$+++ u7990 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LORELEI +++$+++ I can't see anything.
L557076 +++$+++ u7990 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LORELEI +++$+++ And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks?
L557075 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ "At a special session of the General Assembly, 178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining." ROSS That fella's becoming a public menace.
L557003 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ So I understand from the graffiti I've seen.
L557002 +++$+++ u7990 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LORELEI +++$+++ Hey, I know a lot of things!
L557001 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ How would you know?
L556968 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Energy! And when they say "Energy" what do they mean? Nuclear? too dangerous. Solar?? Too underdeveloped.
L556967 +++$+++ u7990 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LORELEI +++$+++ Diet soda?
L556966 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Why stop at coffee!  A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
L556686 +++$+++ u7990 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LORELEI +++$+++ Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
L556685 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
L556682 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!
L556681 +++$+++ u7990 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LORELEI +++$+++ Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...
L557347 +++$+++ u7991 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ MISS HENDERSON +++$+++ There is no handle! You just push a button.
L557346 +++$+++ u7992 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Where's the handle?
L557345 +++$+++ u7991 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ MISS HENDERSON +++$+++ It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art.  People, I am in love with this machine.  Go ahead, Mr. White.
L556793 +++$+++ u7992 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Why do I have to do this?
L556792 +++$+++ u7991 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ MISS HENDERSON +++$+++ Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.
L556535 +++$+++ u7992 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
L556534 +++$+++ u7991 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ MISS HENDERSON +++$+++ By hand. Like the pioneers did.
L556533 +++$+++ u7992 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
L556532 +++$+++ u7991 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ MISS HENDERSON +++$+++ Mr. White, the next number, please?
L556499 +++$+++ u7991 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ MISS HENDERSON +++$+++ You've got to pick three more numbers.
L556498 +++$+++ u7992 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Okay? Goodbye.
L556497 +++$+++ u7991 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ MISS HENDERSON +++$+++ 53!
L556496 +++$+++ u7992 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ 53.
L556491 +++$+++ u7991 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ MISS HENDERSON +++$+++ Because you're the Editor-in-Chief. Your integrity is unquestioned. LOIS I have a question.
L556490 +++$+++ u7992 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
L556489 +++$+++ u7991 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ MISS HENDERSON +++$+++ Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.  The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.
L556695 +++$+++ u7995 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SIMPSON +++$+++ He's bound to slip up sooner or later.
L556694 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?
L556684 +++$+++ u7995 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SIMPSON +++$+++ Hello.
L556683 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
L556680 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
L556679 +++$+++ u7995 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SIMPSON +++$+++ I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!
L556676 +++$+++ u7995 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SIMPSON +++$+++ Embezzled, Mr. Webster.  Stolen from the firm.
L556675 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Missing????
L556674 +++$+++ u7995 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SIMPSON +++$+++ 85,000 dollars.
L557258 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
L557257 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Yes! This time we got it right!
L557255 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Don't bet on it!
L557254 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
L557223 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
L557222 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ He's the only one who can operate this --
L557221 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Who needs Gus?
L557220 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
L557219 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Come on, let's give it a dry run.
L557128 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
L557127 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
L557085 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ We can get to work on that oil!
L557084 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
L557083 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ A normal person.
L557082 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all.  Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...
L557012 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage.  We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite--
L557011 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ So?
L557008 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ The planet Superman came from. Krypton.
L557007 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Where did it come from?
L557006 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
L557005 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ What's wrong?
L557004 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...
L556996 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
L556995 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
L556992 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Don't cry, Bubba.
L556991 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.
L556977 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!
L556976 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
L556975 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ We already have a super-tanker.
L556974 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Small potatoes.
L556971 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ TOMORROW THE OIL!
L556970 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Today coffee----
L556969 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!
L556818 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system. How about...hmmmm, someplace small...
L556817 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us.
L556807 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
L556806 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ She's not his mama either.
L556800 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
L556799 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Computers talk to other computers, right?
L556784 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Blizzards! Heat waves!
L556783 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Storms! Floods!
L556782 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ It could make weather!
L556781 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
L556780 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Vulcan is the weather satellite						our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather.
L556692 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
L556691 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ I don't kiss.
L556678 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Get a hold of yourself, Vera.  Nobody else ever will.
L556677 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????
L558690 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ She'll be fine.
L558689 +++$+++ u8001 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Are you okay?
L557999 +++$+++ u8001 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Tourists, about twenty of 'em.
L557998 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Hostages?
L557997 +++$+++ u8001 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ So far the hostages are unharmed.
L557996 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Anybody been hurt?
L557985 +++$+++ u8001 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Yeah. I'll check.
L557984 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Jimmy, how's the -
L558703 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Everything on it.
L558702 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Everything on it?
L558701 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
L558700 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ You do?
L558699 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
L558698 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I'll try to remember that . . .
L558697 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. Nobody expects you to be what you're not.
L558696 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Lois, I really don't see why --
L558695 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ . . . Superman?. . . . .
L558693 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ I'm fine. . . . . .  What  was I talking about?  Before?
L558692 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
L558691 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ See what happens when I don't have my orange juice?  The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .
L558684 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I like worrying about you.
L558683 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
L558682 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Lois, someday --
L558681 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?
L558680 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ What else could I do?
L558679 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.
L558678 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ "They?"
L558677 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Oh, when it comes to you I am. Not that I don't understand why they all need you. but they can't need you more than I do.
L558676 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ You're not selfish at all.
L558675 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
L558674 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L558673 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I "listened to the voices of  reason" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying?
L558671 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Never closed my eyes.
L558670 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Sleep well?
L558669 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Oh, hi.
L558668 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Hi.
L558495 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
L558494 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .
L558493 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I have to try, dammit! Something, anything . . .
L558492 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
L558491 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .
L558481 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I know that, Lois. And I wish he were here . . .
L558480 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
L558479 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
L558478 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Let's get you inside . . . .
L558477 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .
L558473 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
L558472 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
L558450 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Say you love me.
L558449 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.
L558286 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
L558285 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Let's go to my place.
L558284 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Let's go to my place.
L558283 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ I want to.
L558282 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I guess it would be all right if -  Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.
L558281 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ "What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
L558280 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
L558279 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ I'm listening.
L558278 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ We'd better talk.
L558277 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
L558274 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
L558273 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I didn't think I wanted to.
L558272 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Maybe you wanted to.
L558271 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ You don't have anything to be sorry 	about.  How could I . . .
L558269 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Oh come on, that's ridic -
L558268 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ I was right. you are Superman.
L558267 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Lois, I . . .
L558266 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ It's true. It's true.
L558248 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !
L558247 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Oh Clark, no!
L558238 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ What??
L558237 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Because of what I'm betting.  My life.
L558236 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ How could you win a crazy bet like --
L558235 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
L558234 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ You've been under a lot of pressure lately -
L558233 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ No, of course not, Lois. You just get carried away sometimes. Believe me, I understand --
L558232 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
L558231 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Who ????
L558229 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Whoever, I  Look, maybe you ought to take a walk and clear your head. I'II meet you back at the motel.
L558228 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
L558227 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
L558223 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ And you weren't. As usual. What do you say to that?
L558222 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Superman? Oh, was he here?
L558221 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
L558220 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
L558219 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Where were you?
L558208 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Frankly, once you've seen Superman in action, Niagara Falls tends to leave you cold.
L558207 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
L558206 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
L558205 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Lois, you're amazing.
L558204 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
L558199 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ That's because you can hardly see through those things.
L558198 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
L558195 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Mr. Smith -  -- the "complimentary couch."
L558194 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  Sleeping arrangements.
L558193 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Oh sure, everything is complimentary. Until you get the bill.
L558192 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ A "complimentary corsage."
L558190 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
L558189 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
L558187 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Oh, you're a great writer, Lois, nobody doubts that.
L558186 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
L558185 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ 'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
L558179 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ In July???
L558178 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ It is kinda romantic.
L558089 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Of course, that's what friends are for.
L558088 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Really?
L558087 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care?
L558085 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Be my guest.
L558084 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Maybe I could try --
L558083 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
L558082 +++$+++ u7998 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?
L558080 +++$+++ u8004 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Well, you shouldn't  Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do.
