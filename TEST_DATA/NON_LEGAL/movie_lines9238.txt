L386457 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
L386456 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
L386455 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
L386454 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
L386453 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ And who the hell is that?
L386452 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Somebody named Leo Crow.
L386451 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
L386450 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
L386449 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
L386448 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Just so you know, I've overridden the vehicle locator.  I just wanted to talk to you before Justice --
L386376 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ No?  How's an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them?
L386375 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ We won't let them.
L386374 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ You understand, John, that the minute Precrime goes national, they're going to take it away from us.
L386373 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I'm fine, Lamar.
L386372 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
L386371 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ In the middle of the night?
L386370 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I go running down there.
L386369 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
L386368 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I'm fine.
L386367 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
L386366 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ What?
L386365 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ Lara called me.
L386364 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
L386363 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
L386362 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
L386361 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
L386354 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there.  And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
L386353 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ And you say the third prevision was, what, a little fuzzy or something?
L386219 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ Tuck in your shirt.
L386218 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I understand.  What's the other thing?
L386217 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
L386216 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L386215 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ I need you to do two things for me. One, watch Danny Witwer.
L386214 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I understand.  Sir.
L386213 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ You understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what we've been doing down here has been some noble-minded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.
L386212 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ Don't apologize, John.
L386211 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
L386210 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
L386130 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Hang on, Lamar --
L386129 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
L386128 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Uh-huh...
L386127 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
L386126 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ The nation votes this week...
L386125 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Don't worry, Lamar.
L386124 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ Tell me not to worry, John.
L386506 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
L386505 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ You don't have to do this, Chief.
L386504 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Everybody runs.
L386503 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ Don't run, Chief.  You know we'll catch you.  You trained us.
L386092 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I show a cop on horseback.
L386091 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
L386090 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
L386089 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
L386081 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
L386080 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ Uh, sir...
L386079 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --
L386078 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
L386077 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ You're kidding, that's today?
L386076 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.
L386070 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.
L386069 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ Seventeen minutes.
L386424 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Take your time.
L386423 +++$+++ u1926 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ JAD +++$+++ Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
L386422 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.
L386418 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Still scrubbing... looks like there's a third party, somebody wearing shades just out the window...
L386417 +++$+++ u1926 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ JAD +++$+++ Any ID on the shooter yet?
L386416 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Confirm with trig and image.
L386415 +++$+++ u1926 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ JAD +++$+++ That was easy.
L386414 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
L386409 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
L386408 +++$+++ u1926 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ JAD +++$+++ I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
L386407 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
L386406 +++$+++ u1926 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ JAD +++$+++ The victim's name is Leo Crow.
L386400 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Amazing there's someone within two hundred miles actually dumb enough to still do that.
L386399 +++$+++ u1926 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ JAD +++$+++ Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
L386398 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Red Ball?
L386396 +++$+++ u1926 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ JAD +++$+++ We're in motion on something.
L386395 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
L386278 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Go back to work.  All of you.
L386277 +++$+++ u1926 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ JAD +++$+++ Sir?
L386276 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Uh-huh.  Jad?
L386275 +++$+++ u1926 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ JAD +++$+++ Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
L386274 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ You guys are nodding your heads like you actually know what the hell he's talking about.
L386149 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Did Marks close the front door?!
L386148 +++$+++ u1926 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ JAD +++$+++ What?
L386147 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Did he close the front door?
L386146 +++$+++ u1926 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ JAD +++$+++ Go ahead.
L386133 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Now look at him...
L386132 +++$+++ u1926 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ JAD +++$+++ Yeah?  So?
L386131 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Look at the kid.  In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.
L386096 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Georgetown.
L386095 +++$+++ u1926 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ JAD +++$+++ The mall?
L386094 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ No maglev system.
L386093 +++$+++ u1926 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ JAD +++$+++ Somewhere near the capital?
L386068 +++$+++ u1926 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ JAD +++$+++ From solar position, Trig & Image confirms it at approximately eight oh-four a.m.
L386067 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
L386066 +++$+++ u1926 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ JAD +++$+++ Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
L386057 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Run the subscription list...
L386056 +++$+++ u1926 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ JAD +++$+++ We can't grab it...
L386041 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
L386040 +++$+++ u1926 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ JAD +++$+++ We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
L386039 +++$+++ u1926 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ JAD +++$+++ Red Ball -- double homicide: one male, one female.  Killer's male, white, 40's.
L386038 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Okay, Jad, what's coming?
L386445 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Possession alone will cost you six months, not to mention your badge.
L386444 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ You gonna tell on me?
L386443 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ It seems I've found a flaw, John  You.
L386442 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
L386441 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ You set me up...
L386288 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ I agree.  The system is perfect. If there's a flaw, it's human.  It always is.  Thank you for the tour, Wally.
L386287 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
L386286 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Flaws.
L386285 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
L386284 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
L386281 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ I don't know.  He was shot and killed when I was fourteen on the steps of his church in Bethesda.
L386280 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ What does he think of your chosen line of work?
L386279 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran.
L386273 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ The oracle isn't where the power is anyway.  The power's always been with the priests.  Even if they had to invent the oracle.
L386272 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Just a nickname.
L386271 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ But you call this room the "temple".
L386270 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
L386269 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
L386251 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
L386250 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ There's no question.  You don't have any.
L386249 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ If it's a question of authority.
L386248 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Maybe you didn't hear me.
L386247 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ So I'll be the first one to go in then?
L386246 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
L386245 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Really?  You've never been inside?
L386244 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
L386243 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ To them.
L386242 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ To Hineman?
L386241 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
L386240 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
L386237 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
L386236 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
L386235 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
L386234 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
L386233 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ But it didn't fall.  You caught it.
L386232 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Yes.
L386231 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ You're certain?
L386230 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Because it was going to fall.
L386229 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Why did you catch that?
L386227 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Yes, it is.
L386226 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
L386140 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ You mind if I tag along?
L386139 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
L386138 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
L386087 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
L386086 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
L386792 +++$+++ u1933 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
L386791 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Just go to the beginning!
L386784 +++$+++ u1933 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
L386783 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Are these all of her previsions?
L386777 +++$+++ u1933 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Oh... Hi, John.
L386776 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
L386775 +++$+++ u1933 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Do I know you?  Who are you?
L386774 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Wally, listen to me...
L386301 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ She said...
L386300 +++$+++ u1933 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
L386299 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ She spoke to me.
L386298 +++$+++ u1933 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
L386297 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ She was looking right at me.
L386296 +++$+++ u1933 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ She grabbed you?  Impossible.  The Precogs aren't even aware of us. In the milk all they see is the future.
L386295 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
L386294 +++$+++ u1933 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
L386266 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ It helps if you don't think of them as human.
L386265 +++$+++ u1933 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ They're not in any pain.  We keep their heads pretty well stocked with dopamine and endorphins. Plus, we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels -- don't want 'em to drift off to sleep, but they can't be kept too awake either.
L386257 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
L386256 +++$+++ u1933 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
L386911 +++$+++ u1929 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ RUFUS +++$+++ Uh, I'll try...
L386910 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Rufus, play it back...
L386903 +++$+++ u1929 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ RUFUS +++$+++ I guess that's all of it.
L386902 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ What happened?  Where's the rest?
L386898 +++$+++ u1929 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ RUFUS +++$+++ Tell me how.
L386897 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Stop --
L386891 +++$+++ u1929 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ RUFUS +++$+++ Then take her to Radio Shack.
L386890 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ They don't belong to anybody.
L386889 +++$+++ u1929 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ RUFUS +++$+++ I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
L386888 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ So now I need you to hack into her.
L386887 +++$+++ u1929 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ RUFUS +++$+++ So?
L386886 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
L386885 +++$+++ u1929 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ RUFUS +++$+++ No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
L386884 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ She's got information inside of her.  I need you to get it out.
L386883 +++$+++ u1929 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ RUFUS +++$+++ I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do!  And I swear, I didn't do any of the stuff I did!
L386882 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
L386881 +++$+++ u1929 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ RUFUS +++$+++ Are you reading my mind right now?
L386879 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ That's right.
L386878 +++$+++ u1929 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ RUFUS +++$+++ She's a precog?
L386877 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Rufus.  She's a precog.
L386876 +++$+++ u1929 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ RUFUS +++$+++ I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
L386875 +++$+++ u1929 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ RUFUS +++$+++ Well, hello there, honey-pie.
L386874 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I need help with her.

L386871 +++$+++ u1929 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ RUFUS +++$+++ Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?

L387191 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Sean, wait...
L387190 +++$+++ u1931 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I'm your son.  I'm you.
