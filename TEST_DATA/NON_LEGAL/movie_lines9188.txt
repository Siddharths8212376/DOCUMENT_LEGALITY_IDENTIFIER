L316057 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?
L316055 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ A couple days later they decided to use the Ladder, on one test battalion. Yours. Just in an infintessimal dose in the food supply, to prove its effectiveness in the field. They were sure your unit would have the highest kill ratio in the whole goddamn offensive. And you did, too. But not the way they tnought.
L316054 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Like it was yesterday.
L316053 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember.
L316051 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ That's what they called it. A fast trip right down the ladder.  Right to the primal fear, the base anger. I'm tellin' you, it was powerful stuff. But I don't need to tell you. You know.
L316050 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ The Ladder?
L316049 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.
L316048 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
L316047 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
L316046 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Shows how much you knew.
L316045 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there?  Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.
L316044 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Long time ago.
L316043 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ So first I'm arrested, right? Best LSD I ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I'm lucky. That was '68.
L316041 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Observation, mainly. Clinical study. You were one of the survivors.
L316040 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
L316039 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know me. I've been tracking you for a long time. I just wish I'd spoken to you before tonight.
L315386 +++$+++ u1627 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ If you're lucky.
L315385 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ No. I'll take the other one.  Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.
L315384 +++$+++ u1627 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
L315383 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ You got a nice tan, though.
L315382 +++$+++ u1627 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Hot. Where do I sign?
L315381 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ How was Palm Springs?
L315380 +++$+++ u1627 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
L315379 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Where's Wong?
L315378 +++$+++ u1627 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ I know. That's why I'm asking.
L315377 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ They're awfully heavy.
L315376 +++$+++ u1627 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ How 'bout over there?  No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room.
L315298 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Yeah, you and everyone else.
L315297 +++$+++ u1627 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ I no from around here.
L315296 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet?  Excuse me.  Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep.
L316241 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Help me!
L316240 +++$+++ u1626 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Push 'em back.
L316239 +++$+++ u1626 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
L316238 +++$+++ u1626 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ He'll never make it.
L316237 +++$+++ u1626 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Total delirium.
L316236 +++$+++ u1626 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ He's burning up.
L316139 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ What?!
L316138 +++$+++ u1626 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Dream on!
L316009 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ What is wrong with you?
L316008 +++$+++ u1626 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Clear the area. This is an order!
L316001 +++$+++ u1626 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ We're not going to hurt you.
L316000 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
L315999 +++$+++ u1626 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Please come quietly.
L315998 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ For what? For seeking the truth?
L315997 +++$+++ u1626 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest.
L315523 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Help me!
L315522 +++$+++ u1626 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Push 'em back.
L315521 +++$+++ u1626 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
L315520 +++$+++ u1626 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Total delirium.
L315519 +++$+++ u1626 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ He's burning up.
L315958 +++$+++ u1619 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ Of course it is. What else could it be?
L315957 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ This is not a dream! This is my life.
L315956 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Last night! They were as real as you are!
L315955 +++$+++ u1619 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L315954 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ That's a lie. My family was here.
L315953 +++$+++ u1619 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
L315952 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
L315951 +++$+++ u1619 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
L315950 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I'm awake?
L315949 +++$+++ u1619 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ Lennox Hospital.
L315948 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Where am I?
L315947 +++$+++ u1619 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ Well, don't we look better this morning? That was a hard night, wasn't it?
L315905 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
L315904 +++$+++ u1619 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ We're doing everything we can.
L315903 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Call my chiropractor.
L315902 +++$+++ u1619 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ I'll page him.
L315732 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
L315731 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
L315730 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ You come home with me.
L315729 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home.
L315728 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ They're monsters, Jake. We're both seein' 'em. There's gotta be a connection. Something.
L315727 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I don't know. I don't know.
L315726 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
L315725 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ The army?
L315724 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
L315723 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
L315722 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Oh God. I know. I know.
L315721 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I was coming apart at the seams.
L315720 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
L315719 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Everywhere, like a plague.
L315718 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You've seen them?
L315717 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I've seen them too ... the demons!
L315716 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What do you mean?
L315715 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about.
L315714 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't know what to do.
L315713 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
L315711 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ They're waitin' for me, that's why.
L315710 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Why not?
L315709 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home.
L315708 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
L315707 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just gonna jump outta my skin. They're just drivin' me wild.
L315706 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ They've been followin' me. They're comin' outta the walls. I don't trust anyone. I'm not even sure I trust you. But I gotta talk to someone. I'm gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind.
L315705 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Who is?
L315704 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me.
L315701 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yeah.
L315700 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ You in trouble?
L315699 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't know.
L315698 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ What's goin' on Paul?
L315697 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
L315696 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ That black car?
L315695 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Let's get a couple drinks, okay?  Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us?
L315694 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ What's wrong?
L315693 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
L315692 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ You can't talk in Brownsville?
L315691 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I just need to talk.
L315690 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Why the hell we drivin' here?
L315689 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
L315688 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Nope.
L315687 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Still married, Jake?
L315686 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
L315685 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ It's not worth it. You'll never win.
L315684 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
L315683 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
L315682 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Count 'em on one hand.
L315681 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed?
L315680 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I work in a bakery.
L315679 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Jesus, man, you look terrific. You must have put on twenty pounds.
L315678 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I need to see you.
L315677 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick.
L315676 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I need to see you, Jake.
L315675 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
L315674 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Nothin' much.
L315673 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
L315672 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ A long time.
L315671 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Paul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the hell are you? I haven't seen you in what, five, six, years?
L315670 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Paul Gruneger! Well I'll be goddamned!
L315669 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Paul Gruneger!
L315668 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Speaking.
L315667 +++$+++ u1620 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Jacob Singer?
L315666 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Hello.
L315497 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
L315496 +++$+++ u1615 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ LEADER +++$+++ Do you want me to get someone?
L315495 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
L315494 +++$+++ u1615 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ LEADER +++$+++ No one knows. They say it blew up.
L315493 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ How did it happen?
L315492 +++$+++ u1615 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ LEADER +++$+++ Last month, before Thanksgiving.
L315491 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
L315490 +++$+++ u1615 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ LEADER +++$+++ A car accident.
L315489 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Died?
L315488 +++$+++ u1615 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ LEADER +++$+++ I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.
L315487 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?
L315486 +++$+++ u1615 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ LEADER +++$+++ Can I help you?
L315607 +++$+++ u1618 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MRS. CARMICHAEL +++$+++ Okay. My husband's got two more bags. He's coming. They're heavy.
L315606 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
L315605 +++$+++ u1618 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MRS. CARMICHAEL +++$+++ On top of him?
L315604 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Pour it in.
L315603 +++$+++ u1618 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MRS. CARMICHAEL +++$+++ I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
L315602 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ He doesn't like it.
L315601 +++$+++ u1618 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MRS. CARMICHAEL +++$+++ Is he all right?
L315600 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Bring it in.
L315599 +++$+++ u1618 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MRS. CARMICHAEL +++$+++ I have some ice from the machine.
L317672 +++$+++ u1628 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ AZRAEL +++$+++ Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
L317671 +++$+++ u1631 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ DALLAS +++$+++ I don't have all day, kid.
L317669 +++$+++ u1628 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ AZRAEL +++$+++ Alright, asshole.
L317668 +++$+++ u1631 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ DALLAS +++$+++ Okay, enough of this shit.

L317665 +++$+++ u1628 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ AZRAEL +++$+++ Asshole that does not count as a kill.
L317662 +++$+++ u1628 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ AZRAEL +++$+++ Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
L317661 +++$+++ u1631 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ DALLAS +++$+++ He's not part of the program.
L317660 +++$+++ u1628 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ AZRAEL +++$+++ Pause play.
L317659 +++$+++ u1631 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ DALLAS +++$+++ That sucks. Why won't he go down?
L317656 +++$+++ u1628 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ AZRAEL +++$+++ Speaking of which, duck!
L317655 +++$+++ u1631 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ DALLAS +++$+++ You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
L317654 +++$+++ u1628 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ AZRAEL +++$+++ You got lucky.
L317653 +++$+++ u1631 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ DALLAS +++$+++ That's nine to four, geek-boy.
L317476 +++$+++ u1631 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ DALLAS +++$+++ Punk?
L317475 +++$+++ u1628 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ AZRAEL +++$+++ Watch it punk, I'm armed.
L318316 +++$+++ u1639 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ RIZZO +++$+++ Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
L318315 +++$+++ u1629 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ BOEMAN +++$+++ Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
L318269 +++$+++ u1639 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ RIZZO +++$+++ Delongpre! Out of time!
L318268 +++$+++ u1629 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ BOEMAN +++$+++ Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
L318243 +++$+++ u1639 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ RIZZO +++$+++ Done?
L318242 +++$+++ u1629 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ BOEMAN +++$+++ The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it  reaches the core, we're done.
L318222 +++$+++ u1639 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ RIZZO +++$+++ We made it?
L318221 +++$+++ u1629 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ BOEMAN +++$+++ Minimal.
L318182 +++$+++ u1639 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ RIZZO +++$+++ I don't know. Nothing.
