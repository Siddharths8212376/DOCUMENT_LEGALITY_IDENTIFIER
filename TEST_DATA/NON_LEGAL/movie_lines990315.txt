L521146 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Glasses?
L521145 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I want mine to wear glasses.
L521144 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
L521143 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
L521142 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You're entitled.
L521141 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
L521140 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Going to catch yourself a rich bird?
L521139 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Millionaires.  Flocks of them.  They all go south for the winter.  Like birds.
L521138 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What's in Florida?
L521137 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
L521136 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ About what?
L521135 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.
L521134 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You are?
L521133 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?
L521129 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
L521128 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Brains aren't everything.
L521127 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright.
L521126 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Men!
L521125 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
L521124 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You don't say?
L521123 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
L521122 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yeah.
L521121 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.
L521120 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yeah.
L521119 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ But you're a girl, thank goodness.
L521118 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You know - I play tenor sax.
L521117 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Every time!
L521116 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ That so?
L521115 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
L521114 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Really?
L521113 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.
L521112 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Bingo?
L521111 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
L521110 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You can't trust those guys.
L521109 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I'll say.
L521108 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Rough?
L521107 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!
L521106 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Me?
L521105 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Have you ever been with a male band?
L521104 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Afford it?
L521103 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
L521102 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Then why did you take this job?
L521101 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
L521100 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
L521099 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I'm not very bright, I guess.
L521098 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway?
L521097 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Better keep a lookout.
L521096 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
L521095 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Put it here.
L520944 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ All the girls drink - but I'm the one that gets caught.  That's the story of my life. I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
L520943 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ We understand.
L520940 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Don't get me started on that.  Want a drink?  It's bourbon.
L520939 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Running away?  From what?
L520936 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I play the ukulele.  And I sing too.
L520935 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh.
L520934 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ On the Baltimore and Ohio.
L520933 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Where did he conduct?
L520932 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Yes.  I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.
L520927 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ If they catch me once more, they'll boot me out of the band.  You the replacement for the bass and the sax?
L520926 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Tell what?
L520624 +++$+++ u7714 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MOZARELLA +++$+++ Show the gentleman to the chapel - pew number three.
L520623 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
L520622 +++$+++ u7714 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MOZARELLA +++$+++ PLEASE!
L520621 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ That's because I've been on the wagon.
L520620 +++$+++ u7714 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MOZARELLA +++$+++ I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
L520619 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ I come to the old lady's funeral.
L520618 +++$+++ u7714 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MOZARELLA +++$+++ Good evening, sir.
L520638 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ Some people got no respect for the dead.
L520637 +++$+++ u7724 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Who's going to raid a funeral?
L520636 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ Better bring the check now - in case the joint gets raided.
L520634 +++$+++ u7724 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Sorry, sir.  That's reserved for members of the immediate family.
L520633 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ Haven't you got another pew - not so close to the band?  How about that one?
L520632 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ Make is Scotch.  A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.
L520631 +++$+++ u7724 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
L520630 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ Coffee?
L520629 +++$+++ u7724 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
L520628 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ Booze.
L520627 +++$+++ u7724 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ What'll it be, sir?
L521750 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ You boys know anything about any garage - or any witnesses?
L521749 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
L521748 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ You and who else?
L521747 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ Quit kidding.  You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.
L521746 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ I sleep with my spats on.
L521745 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ You shave with your spats on?
L521744 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ I cut myself shaving.
L521743 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
L521742 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ Why?
L521741 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
L521740 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
L521739 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
L521738 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ That's an opera, you ignoramus.
L521737 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ What's his first name?  And where does he live?
L521736 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ Me?  I was at Rigoletto.
L521735 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
L521734 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ Big joke!
L521733 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
L521732 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
L521731 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one.
L520685 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ These are my lawyers - all Harvard men.
L520684 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
L520683 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
L520680 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ Toothpick Charlie?  Never heard of him.
L520679 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
L520678 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ We got different information.
L520677 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
L520676 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint.  Mozarella is just fronting for you.
L520675 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ Me?  I'm just a customer here.
L520674 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
L520673 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
L520672 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
L520671 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ I never join nothin'.
L520670 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ A little country club we run for retired bootleggers.  I'm gonna put your name up for membership.
L520669 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ Go where?
L520668 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ Okay, Spats - the services are over. Lets go.
L520615 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ Goodbye, Charlie.
L520614 +++$+++ u7723 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ TOOTHPICK CHARLIE +++$+++ Look, Chief - I better blow now, because if Spats Colombo sees me, it's Goodbye Charlie.
L520612 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ Okay, Charlie.
L520611 +++$+++ u7723 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ TOOTHPICK CHARLIE +++$+++ If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.
L520610 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ Thanks, Charlie.
L520609 +++$+++ u7723 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ TOOTHPICK CHARLIE +++$+++ I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
L520608 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
L520607 +++$+++ u7723 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ TOOTHPICK CHARLIE +++$+++ Spats Colombo.
L520606 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ Refresh my memory.
L520605 +++$+++ u7723 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ TOOTHPICK CHARLIE +++$+++ I already told you.
L520604 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ And who runs it?
L520603 +++$+++ u7723 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ TOOTHPICK CHARLIE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L520602 +++$+++ u7715 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ MULLIGAN +++$+++ All right, Charlie - this the joint?
L521718 +++$+++ u7718 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ PARADISE +++$+++ Orders from Little Bonaparte.
L521717 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ What for?
L521716 +++$+++ u7718 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ PARADISE +++$+++ Yeah.  You never know who's going to be next.  Okay, Spats.  Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms.
L521715 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ Well, we all got to go sometime.
L521714 +++$+++ u7718 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ PARADISE +++$+++ We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
L521713 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ Why wouldn't I?
L521712 +++$+++ u7718 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ PARADISE +++$+++ Hi, Spats.  We was laying eight to one you wouldn't show.
L520829 +++$+++ u7723 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ TOOTHPICK CHARLIE +++$+++ No, Spats - no, no, no -  NO!
L520828 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ Too bad, Charlie.  You would have had three eights.  Goodbye, Charlie!
L520827 +++$+++ u7723 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ TOOTHPICK CHARLIE +++$+++ Honest, Spats.  I had nothing to do with it.
L520826 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
L520825 +++$+++ u7723 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ TOOTHPICK CHARLIE +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.
L520824 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ Oh, I wouldn't say that.  You were nice enough to recommend my mortuary to some of your friends...
L520823 +++$+++ u7723 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ TOOTHPICK CHARLIE +++$+++ You don't owe me no nothing.
L520822 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ Just dropped in to pay my respects.
L520821 +++$+++ u7723 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ TOOTHPICK CHARLIE +++$+++ What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
L520820 +++$+++ u7720 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SPATS +++$+++ Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
L523309 +++$+++ u7725 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Yeah. Most important day of my life. Whatever. Listen, I chose you to be my Maid of Honor for a lot of reasons: I love you, you’re my favorite, and only, half-sister, blah blah blah. But the main reason I picked you is because you’ve been so miserable for the past few years, I knew you wouldn’t outshine me.  But here it is, my big day. My big day. And something doesn’t feel right. Maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night, I don’t know, but your misery just isn’t working for me anymore.
L523308 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Wow. You look beautiful.
L523287 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Sure, disappear. We’ve been walking away our whole lives.
L523286 +++$+++ u7725 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You know what? I’m not having this conversation right now.
L523283 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Hey.
L523282 +++$+++ u7725 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Hey.
L523224 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ You practically bribed him with your erector set.
L523223 +++$+++ u7725 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
L523222 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend.  I was fourteen.
L523027 +++$+++ u7725 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I’m fine. I promise.
L523026 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Are you sure you’re okay?
L523025 +++$+++ u7725 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I should get going.
L523024 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ What? Why? What do you mean?
L523023 +++$+++ u7725 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ God, Kat! Please. Don’t be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.
L523022 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ But I do. I will. You’re my sister.
L523021 +++$+++ u7725 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Don’t worry about it.
L523020 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Do you want to come in for a minute? We could talk about--
L523008 +++$+++ u7725 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ The wedding.  I am so, so bad! I don’t think I should be allowed to get married.
L523007 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Pub Golf?
L523006 +++$+++ u7725 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I don’t think I can go through with this.
L523004 +++$+++ u7725 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Bacardi 151.
L523003 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Why don’t you get my half sister her seventh hole?
L523001 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Drunk isn’t the same thing as happy, Amy.
L523000 +++$+++ u7725 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Oh, shut up and be happy. It’s always this or that. You’re never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
L522999 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Christ, Amy.
L522994 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?
L522993 +++$+++ u7725 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Did Kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath?
L522786 +++$+++ u7725 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ But I’m not taking your name, buster. I’m a feminist!  I need icey! Mr. husband-man, get me more icey!
L522785 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Except it’s Scotch.
L522784 +++$+++ u7725 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Perfect. All ginny.
L522782 +++$+++ u7725 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Exactly! Today’s my day. Tomorrow will be my day. And the day after that? My day.
L522781 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ There’s finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
L522780 +++$+++ u7725 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You know what I love about all this?
L523190 +++$+++ u7725 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ And she wonders why I swim to the bottom of a Lemondrop every time I see her.
L523189 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Or Kat....
L523188 +++$+++ u7725 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ If Ed ever found out....
L523187 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Still--
L523186 +++$+++ u7725 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ It was such a long time ago.
L523180 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Actually, I do.
L523179 +++$+++ u7725 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You know all that “if these walls could talk” stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?
L523178 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ To make sure you’re okay.
L523177 +++$+++ u7725 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ What for?
L523176 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Sorry to interrupt. Your dad sent me.
L523131 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ It’s not me. I swear. It’s her. She’s magic.
L523130 +++$+++ u7725 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Fred Astaire and what’s her face!
L523325 +++$+++ u7727 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Last night?
L523324 +++$+++ u7725 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Jeffrey told her last night.
L523323 +++$+++ u7727 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Does Kat know?
L523322 +++$+++ u7727 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.
L523321 +++$+++ u7725 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Say something. Please.
L523135 +++$+++ u7727 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Your probably best off pretending you’re asleep.
L523134 +++$+++ u7725 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Whatever you do, don’t mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
L523133 +++$+++ u7727 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You’d better get going. My parents will be ‘round to cart you off to the country.
L523306 +++$+++ u7726 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ So she flirted with Tony, and you got mad and sent him away. Who did that leave?  You and Amy. Reunited.
L523305 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ She did?
L523304 +++$+++ u7726 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasn’t just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
