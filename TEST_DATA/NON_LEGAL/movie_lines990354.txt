L552993 +++$+++ u7932 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BUFF +++$+++ And your mom.
L552992 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
L552991 +++$+++ u7932 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BUFF +++$+++ Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
L552990 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie.
L552986 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, "Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out." My duty as a human being is to be pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. It's all so fucking futile.
L552985 +++$+++ u7932 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BUFF +++$+++ Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
L552984 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
L552983 +++$+++ u7932 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BUFF +++$+++ Oh yeah? Oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? Federal Express? Hm? By the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard.
L552974 +++$+++ u7932 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BUFF +++$+++ Needs some pizza in his diet.
L552973 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.
L553593 +++$+++ u7932 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BUFF +++$+++ You know, I should, um, make a video of this place. You know, bring the camera in.
L553592 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Really?

L553492 +++$+++ u7932 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BUFF +++$+++ Wait, what happened to the tree?
L553491 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.
L553459 +++$+++ u7932 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BUFF +++$+++ Play it! Come on!

L553024 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Pony? What's a "pony"? You mean that geek who played the folk music at the senior prom? What's that guy's name? Neil Moynihan?
L553003 +++$+++ u7932 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BUFF +++$+++ Hey, don't tell us about private property. This is America, my friend.
L553002 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Come on man.
L552976 +++$+++ u7932 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BUFF +++$+++ You're fascist, man. Neofascist.
L552975 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off.
L553973 +++$+++ u7934 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ It was really nice meeting you, Jeff. If you're ever in L.A., you should come by the offices. I talked to Pony earlier. He said he had a really nice time and he's really looking forward to reading some of your songs.
L553972 +++$+++ u7932 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BUFF +++$+++ I will.
L553971 +++$+++ u7934 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ You better! Yes!

L553381 +++$+++ u7934 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.
L553901 +++$+++ u7937 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ NAZEER +++$+++ Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
L553900 +++$+++ u7932 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BUFF +++$+++ Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
L553899 +++$+++ u7937 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ NAZEER +++$+++ Yeah it's okay. You know, we have a saying back home: "Either the salt is rotten or the meat."
L553898 +++$+++ u7932 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BUFF +++$+++ You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
L553897 +++$+++ u7937 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ NAZEER +++$+++ You're a drunk and an idiot.
L553896 +++$+++ u7932 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BUFF +++$+++ Good. See you later.
L553895 +++$+++ u7937 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ NAZEER +++$+++ In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.
L553894 +++$+++ u7932 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BUFF +++$+++ Um, if you're talking to me, could you make some sense? 'Cause I don't speak Swahili.
L553893 +++$+++ u7937 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ NAZEER +++$+++ I'll tell you what. When I get my engineering degree and I'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.
L553892 +++$+++ u7932 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BUFF +++$+++ Glad it's okay.
L553891 +++$+++ u7937 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ NAZEER +++$+++ It's okay.

L553158 +++$+++ u7932 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BUFF +++$+++ Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for that, mama!

L553142 +++$+++ u7932 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BUFF +++$+++ No, you don't belong here. We were here before you.
L553141 +++$+++ u7937 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ NAZEER +++$+++ Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
L553140 +++$+++ u7932 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BUFF +++$+++ You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is our corner. You don't fucking own it!
L553137 +++$+++ u7937 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ NAZEER +++$+++ Look, look, I'm not joking around now, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go!
L553136 +++$+++ u7932 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BUFF +++$+++ Hey, call the cops! Call 'em, call 'em right now, man. Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up. He'll definitely take your word over mine. You can tell him about the trespassing. I'll tell him about how you sell beer to minors.
L553133 +++$+++ u7937 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ NAZEER +++$+++ That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
L553132 +++$+++ u7932 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BUFF +++$+++ It's safe, come on.

L553001 +++$+++ u7937 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ NAZEER +++$+++ This is private property, my friend.
L553000 +++$+++ u7932 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BUFF +++$+++ Hey, we're just having a conversation.

L553848 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Hey, Gary, how's the divorce comin'?
L553847 +++$+++ u7933 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ CHIP +++$+++ Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.

L553844 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.
L553841 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Uh, you know, just admiring the scenery, you know?
L553840 +++$+++ u7933 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ CHIP +++$+++ What's up guys?
L553661 +++$+++ u7934 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L553660 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Taking care of business.
L553659 +++$+++ u7934 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?
L553620 +++$+++ u7934 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson.
L553619 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ No, no, see, you, you don't understand.
L553618 +++$+++ u7934 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ Mm-hm. I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself. If I didn't want to be here, I'd be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids looking for Chinese food.
L553617 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Yeah?
L553616 +++$+++ u7934 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ I know. It's okay.
L553615 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ I'm not a nice guy.
L553614 +++$+++ u7934 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ That's what I mean.
L553613 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ It's nice to do a lot of things.
L553612 +++$+++ u7934 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
L553611 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ It's a mistake to think that.
L553610 +++$+++ u7934 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ Deep down. Way down.
L553609 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
L553608 +++$+++ u7934 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ Erica.
L553607 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ What was your name again?
L553606 +++$+++ u7934 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ I mean, what is there to be happy about really? I mean, going to the gym, climbing the StairMaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. Smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. Sometimes I just want something different, you know?
L553575 +++$+++ u7934 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ Let's see.
L553574 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
L553573 +++$+++ u7934 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ You cut off your little finger?

So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.

L553570 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
L553569 +++$+++ u7934 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ Really?
L553568 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.

L553561 +++$+++ u7934 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
L553560 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ What about me? I don't have a car.

L553555 +++$+++ u7934 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ You got everything right but the car. My dad didn't get me a BMW.
L553515 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. I mean, I know, it's time to leave the nest. Parents hate your smoking. You didn't tell them about the abortion. All your friends got boob jobs, you got the tattoo instead. Subscribe to Vaniety Fair.
