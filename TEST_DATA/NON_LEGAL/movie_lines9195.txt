L329709 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Why aren't you at work?
L329708 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
L329707 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
L329706 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?
L329705 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Right. I hear they can be kind of a time-suck.
L329704 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ No, she's working late tonight. She's trying to accrue some extra time off for when, you know...
L329703 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
L329702 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
L329636 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ That's all right. My axe is named Roosevelt. After Franklin, not Ted. Franklin was the hot one with the polio.
L329635 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Yeah.
L329634 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Your guitar is named Kimber?
L329621 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ You weren't even alive!
L329620 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
L329619 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ '93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
L329618 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ When was this, like '96?
L329617 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
L329616 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Yeah.
L329615 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are?
L329614 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck?
L329613 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
L329612 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
L329611 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Oh.
L329610 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I rock a Harmony.
L329609 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ What do you play?
L329608 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.
L329607 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Shut up.
L329606 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
L329605 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.
L329603 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ We'd better get back downstairs ASAP.
L329602 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Blood and guts.
L329601 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Viscera?
L329600 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
L329599 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Am I supposed to feel happy now?
L329597 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I did steal a squirt of perfume. What do you think? It's Clinique Happy.
L329596 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
L329595 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
L329594 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
L329593 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
L329592 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Sorry. I was just getting something.
L329591 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.
L329570 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.
L329569 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.
L329565 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
L329564 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
L329548 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Cool. Well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit.
L329547 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ No.
L329543 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Geeeerta Rauuuss!
L329542 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.
L329430 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Really? Fingernails?
L329429 +++$+++ u1666 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ SU-CHIN +++$+++ Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails.
L329428 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Well, it was nice seeing you.
L329427 +++$+++ u1666 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ SU-CHIN +++$+++ I heard that was you.
L329426 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
L329425 +++$+++ u1666 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ SU-CHIN +++$+++ No thanks. I'm off pills.
L329424 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ You should try Adderall.
L329423 +++$+++ u1666 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ SU-CHIN +++$+++ No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
L329422 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
L329421 +++$+++ u1666 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ SU-CHIN +++$+++ Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
L329420 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Uh, hi Su-Chin.
L330020 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.
L330019 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Mark? Why is Juno crying?
L330018 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Nothing.
L330017 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Juno? What's going on?
L329900 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Wow! It's magical.
L329899 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Elbow.
L329898 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Oh my God -- It moved! I felt it!
L329892 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.
L329891 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it?
L329887 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!
L329886 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
L329885 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
L329884 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ No...
L329882 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
L329881 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
L329801 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
L329800 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
L329797 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ No, no, I don't think that, Juno. It's just that, we went through a situation before where it didn't work out.
L329796 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
L329795 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
L329792 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.
L329791 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
L329784 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Yeah. Yeah, it kind of does.
L329783 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"
L329782 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Oh my God...
L329781 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ This is the baby. Your baby.
L329780 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ What...
L329779 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
L329778 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Is the baby okay?
L329777 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I went to the doctor today.
L329776 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Then what's going on?
L329775 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Nothing...
L329774 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
L329647 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Look, if I could give it to you now, I would. But it probably looks like a Sea Monkey at this point, so I think we should leave it in there for a while until it gets cuter, you know?
L329646 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Oh really?
L329645 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.
L329642 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
L329641 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.
L329590 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Room with a toilet, got it.
L329589 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
L329588 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
L329587 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
L329563 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Well, you're lucky it's not you.
L329562 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I think pregnancy is beautiful.
L329561 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
L329560 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
L329559 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
L329558 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
L329550 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ A Maker's Mark, please. Up.
L329549 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
L329540 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ You found us in the Penny Saver?
L329539 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know?
L329538 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Sure.
L329537 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Can I take your coats?
L329534 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Vanessa, right?
L329533 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.
L329440 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Congrats.
L329439 +++$+++ u1664 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ PUNK RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie.
L329438 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ No thank you. I'm off sex.
L329437 +++$+++ u1664 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ PUNK RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
L329434 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Juno MacGuff.
L329433 +++$+++ u1664 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ PUNK RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ Your name, please?
L329432 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Hi. I'm here for the big show?
L330113 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Thundercats are go!
L330112 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Or...
L330111 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Either I just pissed my pants or...
L330110 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ What?!
L330081 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
L330080 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I sort of already have.
L330078 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
L330077 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
L330076 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Tore up from the floor up?
L330075 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Please stop now.
L330074 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?
L330073 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Dad, no!
L330072 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
L330071 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Yeah, like people in love.
L330070 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ You mean like couples?
L330069 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
L330068 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Think you can narrow it down for me.
L330067 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I'm losing my faith in humanity.
L330066 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
L330065 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Yeah, she does.
L330064 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.
L330063 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
L330062 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
L330061 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
L330060 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
L330059 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Hi Dad.
L329577 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.
L329576 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Excuse me?
L329552 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.
L329551 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts.
L329523 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
L329522 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
L329512 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!
L329511 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.
L329506 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.
L329505 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
L329504 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair.
L329503 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Okay, this is no laughing matter.
L329500 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
L329499 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ What?
L329495 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.
L329494 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Who is the kid?
L329492 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I'm so sorry, you guys. If it's any consolation, I have heartburn that's like, radiating down to my kneecaps and I haven't gone number two since Wednesday. Morning!
L329491 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ You're pregnant?
L329490 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
L329485 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ What have you done, Junebug? Did you hit someone with the Previa?
L329484 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
L329483 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?
L329415 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?
L329414 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ So Juno, how did your maneuver go last night?
L329407 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...
L329406 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...
L329318 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.
L329317 +++$+++ u1665 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ ROLLO +++$+++ So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle? Minus or plus?
L329315 +++$+++ u1665 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ ROLLO +++$+++ Well, it's not. You're not a lion in a pride!  These kids, acting like lions with their unplanned pregnancies and their Sunny Delights.
L329314 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Jesus, I didn't say it was.
L329313 +++$+++ u1665 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ ROLLO +++$+++ Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
L329312 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Silencio! I just drank my weight in Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto.
L329311 +++$+++ u1665 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ ROLLO +++$+++ Maybe you're having twins. Maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice!
L329306 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.
L329305 +++$+++ u1665 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ ROLLO +++$+++ Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test?
L329936 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore.
L329935 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
L329934 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. She seems so nice and all.
L329933 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
L329932 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
L329931 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
L329930 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
L329929 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
L329928 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
L329927 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
L329926 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
L329925 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
L329924 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Eww, he's all beardy!
L329923 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Keith's hot.
L329922 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
L329921 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
L329920 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!
