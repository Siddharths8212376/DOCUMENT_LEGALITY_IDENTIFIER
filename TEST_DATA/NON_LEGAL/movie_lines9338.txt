L454676 +++$+++ u2518 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ KATHLEEN +++$+++ I'll see you there.
L454675 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Ok.
L454674 +++$+++ u2518 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ KATHLEEN +++$+++ Yeah but I'm serious.
L454673 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ I know.
L454672 +++$+++ u2518 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ KATHLEEN +++$+++ You can't just stay in your house.
L454671 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ I know.
L454670 +++$+++ u2518 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ KATHLEEN +++$+++ Seriously.
L454669 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ I know.
L454668 +++$+++ u2518 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ KATHLEEN +++$+++ You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
L454667 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ I know.
L454666 +++$+++ u2518 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ KATHLEEN +++$+++ You can't be late though.
L454665 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Ok.
L454664 +++$+++ u2518 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ KATHLEEN +++$+++ Seriously.
L454663 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ I know.
L454662 +++$+++ u2518 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ KATHLEEN +++$+++ I'm serious.
L454661 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ I won't.
L454660 +++$+++ u2518 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ KATHLEEN +++$+++ You can't be late.
L454659 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Seven o'clock.
L454658 +++$+++ u2518 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ KATHLEEN +++$+++ What time are you gonna be there?
L454657 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
L454656 +++$+++ u2518 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ KATHLEEN +++$+++ Right now, you're doing nothing?
L454655 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Nothing.
L454654 +++$+++ u2518 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ KATHLEEN +++$+++ What are you doing?
L454653 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Yes I am.
L454652 +++$+++ u2518 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ KATHLEEN +++$+++ Are you going to the party tonight?
L454651 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
L454650 +++$+++ u2518 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ KATHLEEN +++$+++ What are you doing?
L454649 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ This is Barry.
L455110 +++$+++ u2514 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
L455109 +++$+++ u2515 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ That's it.
L455108 +++$+++ u2514 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Ok.
L455107 +++$+++ u2515 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ This is this place called Ace Vintage, you gotta find it, I don't know exactly where this is and I don't understand these maps so just go there and check it out. It's a '61 AC Cobra that this old guy says is fine, but I need to figure out why he's only asking 23 for it. So take a look, the whole thing, call me about that, if it seems alright then I'll head down there and check it out.
L455101 +++$+++ u2515 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ David, Don't. Just. Seriously. It doesn't make sense if you think about it in a fair deal like sense. Ok? It's business. Seriously. One hundred dollars for two days work is a lot more than your family is making sitting around your house. I'm serious now. Ok. Please. Now. Just stop.
L455100 +++$+++ u2514 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ It's....whatever....that's not cool.
L455099 +++$+++ u2515 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ -- she didn't know what she was talking about --
L455098 +++$+++ u2514 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I thought Latisha said you would --
L455097 +++$+++ u2515 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ Your expenses are your own.
L455086 +++$+++ u2515 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ I want you to go right away, I think that's best. I also need you to check out a car for me down there that this guy is selling.
L455085 +++$+++ u2514 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ As soon as you want.
L455084 +++$+++ u2515 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ When can you leave?
L455083 +++$+++ u2514 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ That's cool.
L455453 +++$+++ u2515 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ Shut up, just put him on the phone, it doesn't matter, just shut up --
L455452 +++$+++ u2520 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LATISHA +++$+++ No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
L455451 +++$+++ u2515 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ Put him through.
L455450 +++$+++ u2520 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LATISHA +++$+++ Nothing.
L455449 +++$+++ u2515 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ What did you say?
L455448 +++$+++ u2520 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LATISHA +++$+++ Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
L455447 +++$+++ u2515 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ Hello?
L455105 +++$+++ u2520 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LATISHA +++$+++ You don't need to talk all macho, "shake him out, little bad boy." Whatever -- you're not an action hero, tough guy, you're not a gangster --
L455104 +++$+++ u2515 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ What's the problem?
L455103 +++$+++ u2520 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LATISHA +++$+++ Uch. Shut up, Dean.
L455102 +++$+++ u2515 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ ...keys for the track. You have to gas it up and save the receipts on that. His address. We have a business address too if you need that -- but hit him at his house first, see what this little bad boy is all about and shake him up -- give him a little doe-see-doe --
L455082 +++$+++ u2515 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ I'm only paying two of you guys.
L455081 +++$+++ u2520 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LATISHA +++$+++ So they'll go.
L455414 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ Ok.
L455413 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I'll just see you when you get back here.
L455412 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ Should I call you later?
L455411 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I think he's weird, but that's me.
L455410 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ I'm sorry. You're right.
L455409 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
L455408 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ He did seem a little strange.
L455407 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ You wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes.
L455406 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ It's fine.
L455405 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
L455404 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ No.
L455403 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ So...did my brother call you?
L455402 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ Ok.
L455401 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Just tell him to call me.
L455400 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ Ok. What should I do about Eric?
L455399 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ They need to see the new 484's to make sure it works with their OC....
L455047 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ Ok.
L455046 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
L455043 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ Bye, Barry.
L455042 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
L455041 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ Are you ready?
L455032 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Are you coming to eat with us?
L455031 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ You ready?
L455030 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?
L454993 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Yeah, no, I have to get something from my car, I said.
L454992 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ We should be going --
L454963 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Sorry.
L454962 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
L454961 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ -- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --
L454960 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ It's not bad, it's ok.
L454959 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
L454958 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ Yeah.
L454957 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Are you sure?
L454956 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ I'll go pay for my car.
L454933 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Are you learning how to play the piano? What is that?
L454932 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ It's ok. That's alright.
L454919 +++$+++ u2521 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ It's fine.
L454918 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ He's wearing a suit again, I don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that --
L457288 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ We've still a few lone incurables. Prone to violence, to perversion.
L457287 +++$+++ u2529 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ABBE DU MAUPAS +++$+++ My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
L457286 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.
L457280 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ Ever since his unfortunate death, there's been a surge of interest in his work. I'll use the profits to restore Charenton to her former glory.
L457279 +++$+++ u2529 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ABBE DU MAUPAS +++$+++ I don't believe it. The Marquis de Sade? You're actually publishing his novels?
L457278 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ They've the satisfaction only a hard day's labor can provide.
L457277 +++$+++ u2529 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ABBE DU MAUPAS +++$+++ It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
L457276 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ -- and the listless ones do the binding.
L457271 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ I'm afraid that our endowment has shrivelled to a mere pittance; we're the laughing stock of all France. But -- on a happier note --
L457270 +++$+++ u2529 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ABBE DU MAUPAS +++$+++ I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
L457269 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
L456504 +++$+++ u2530 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think.
L456503 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories --
L456497 +++$+++ u2530 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ Then what's he doing here?
L456496 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ He's a writer, not a madman.
L456495 +++$+++ u2530 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ I hear he's got a whetstone and chisel, and he uses them to sharpen his teeth.
L456494 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Once or twice.
L456493 +++$+++ u2530 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ You've been to his quarters, haven't you?
L456490 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No one's forcing you to listen.
L456489 +++$+++ u2530 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
L456488 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ "And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --"
L457175 +++$+++ u2531 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ CLEANTE +++$+++ "...a poker... he took a poker from the fire..."
L457174 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ "To seal the wound, he took a poker from the fire --"
L457170 +++$+++ u2531 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ CLEANTE +++$+++ "With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --"
L457169 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ "With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --"
L457154 +++$+++ u2531 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ CLEANTE +++$+++ "One day, Fanchon was visited by a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting follicles..."
L457153 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ "One day, Fanchon's first client was a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting each and every follicle..."
L457138 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Now give the signal.
L457137 +++$+++ u2531 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ CLEANTE +++$+++ At your service, Count.
L457136 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd turned into a cat. If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks, and suck the marrow straight out of your bones.
L457135 +++$+++ u2531 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ CLEANTE +++$+++ I'm no longer a man! I awoke to discover I'd turned into a sparrow!
L457134 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?
L457133 +++$+++ u2531 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ CLEANTE +++$+++ Marquis? Is that you?
L457131 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
L457130 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --
L457099 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ You'll hate me now, won't you?
L457098 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
L457097 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ What? What've I done?
L457096 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Go back to your room. Quickly.
L457094 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ They incite us to act. In ways we should not... cannot... a lesson the Marquis would do well to learn.
L457093 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Why not?
L457092 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice.
L457091 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Mother's not half so blind as you.
L457090 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ By whom? The Marquis?
L457089 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...
L457088 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ "Turn you out?"
L457087 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Don't turn us out, Abbe.
L457069 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I've you to look after me, haven't I?
L457068 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.
L457067 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Is that a promise you can truly keep?
L457066 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
L457065 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --
L457064 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ He's not the man who's cast a shadow here.
L457063 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ In part, yes.
L457015 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ If I wasn't such a bad woman on the page, Abbe, I'll hazard I couldn't be such a good woman in life.
L457014 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
L457013 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
L457012 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
L457011 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Ow!
L457010 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest.
L457009 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ But why must you indulge in his pornography?
L457008 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
L457007 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Had I known your taste in novels, I never would've taught you to read.
L457000 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Not now, or we're both done for.
L456999 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I was wrong to free him, but so are you -- for taking all his treasures -- his quills and his ink --
L456763 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
L456762 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Has he hurt you?
L456548 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ The next time you feel the urge to visit the Marquis, I hope you'll come to confession instead.
L456547 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Yes, Abbe?
L456546 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Madeleine --
L456486 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
L456485 +++$+++ u2538 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
L457263 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ You'd deny a dying man his salvation?
L457262 +++$+++ u2545 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ VALCOUR +++$+++ I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
L457261 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ I must grant him his last rites.
L457260 +++$+++ u2545 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ VALCOUR +++$+++ Mustn't do that, sir.
L457259 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Free his mouth.
L456566 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ You needn't worry, Valcour. It's administrative, nothing more.
L456565 +++$+++ u2545 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ VALCOUR +++$+++ They've got no right, sending someone to sit on your shoulder. I work for you; I won't take orders from a stranger.
L457244 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Of course.
L457243 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Surely you'll grant me a final word.
L457242 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ I'm here.
L457241 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Abbe de Coulmier!
L457238 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.
L457237 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed?
L457233 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin.
L457232 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES! IN EVERY ORIFICE! AND ALL THE WHILE, SHE PLEAD FOR MORE --
L457231 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Then it must've been love --
L457230 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ NEVER!
L457229 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Was it impotence?
L457228 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Who's to say I did not?
L457227 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Why was it you never took her by force?
L457226 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Go to hell!
L457225 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
L457224 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
L457223 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ AND DID YOU?
L457222 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
L457221 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ I know, because I felt it myself --
L457220 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Don't confuse one organ with another --
L457219 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ -- the passion in your heart --
L457218 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ -- that was lust --
L457217 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ I saw the longing in your eye --
L457216 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
L457215 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ It's no secret that you loved her.
L457214 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ So many authors are denied the gratification of a concrete response to their work. I am blessed, am I not?
L457213 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ An innocent child is dead.
L457212 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ For fuck's sake, Abbe! What am I to do? Police my readers as you police me? Suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? Would you condemn the Bible? I think not!
