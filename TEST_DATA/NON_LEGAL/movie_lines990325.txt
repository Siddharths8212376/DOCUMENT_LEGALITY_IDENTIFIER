L526711 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ The whole world thinks you're underground.
L526706 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ He says that to all his wives.
L526705 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ We ain't married no more.
L526434 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I couldn't care less.
L526433 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
L526432 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
L526431 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.
L526430 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
L526429 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.
L526428 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I didn't think so.
L526427 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ No...
L526426 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You got a better offer?
L526425 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
L526424 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I gotta survive.
L526423 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?
L526422 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm getting to like it here.
L526421 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Theo, I want you to get out of this town.
L526253 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ You're dead without the pro-tour, and you know it. Get him away from me. Sid and Breeze punch Theo in the face.
L526252 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
L526251 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
L526250 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Fuck you and fuck bowling.
L526249 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
L526248 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Don't say that about my mom!
L526247 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ What makes you so sure it was me? She coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men struggle for the pin.
L526245 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ You wish!
L526244 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm your blood.
L526243 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
L526242 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.
L526241 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ I do what I gotta do to survive.
L526235 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ It looks like dwarf bowling.
L526234 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ What's it look like to you?
L526233 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What the fuck is this?
L526169 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Maybe I could bowl in Japan.
L526168 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
L526167 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
L526166 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
L526165 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ The small ball.
L526164 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ It's the next level, the next dimension...  ...the small ball.
L526163 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Putt-putt golf?
L526162 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ kissed a lotta tadpoles.  Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you.  Putt-putt golf.
L526161 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Watch out for that one. She's got a great average, but she's looking for a prince. And, believe me, she's 
L526151 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Theo! This is Sheila Kastle, my partner's daughter.
L526150 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Theo.
L526146 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.
L526145 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
L526144 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
L526143 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
L526142 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
L526141 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.
L526113 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ I ain't nobody's father!
L526112 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I got a right. You're my father.
L526111 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ You're a bullshit artist, that's what you are. You got no right to be here! Theo yanks the trophy away from Buzz.
L526109 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You knew her. You married her in 1963.
L526108 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ I don't know no Grace Skinner.
L526104 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm your son. You're a hard father to find.
L526103 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Who are you? Who sent you here?
L526102 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ She's my mom.
L526101 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
L526100 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Grace Skinner.
L526099 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Who gave it to you?
L526098 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ It's mine.
L526097 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Where'd you get this ball?
L526092 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Thanks.
L526091 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods. Thanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so that Buzz takes the untainted whip.  Theo takes the other glass.
L526089 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ My mom was there. She told me about it. The 'Fazeli Split.'
L526088 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ That game was before you was born.
L526087 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.
L526086 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
L526085 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
L526077 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I've never had orange whips, I'm from Akron.
L526076 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
L526075 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
L526074 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ What do you think I can do?
L526073 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
L526072 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ 100 years! 
L526071 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ They suspended me for 100 years.
L526070 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ I got suspended when I was young, too. I was pretty cocky in my day.
L526064 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Don't worry about the Congress, they're just a bunch of moralistic busy-bodies.
L526063 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
L526062 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Need some advice, huh.
L526061 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm not on the tour this year.
L526060 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour.
L526059 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Theo.
L526058 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Buzz Fazeli.
L526116 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ You see what you did?  Take your ball and get out.
L526115 +++$+++ u7798 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ MILLIE +++$+++ My poor baby!
L526106 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Millie, please.  I don't have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door.
L526105 +++$+++ u7798 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ MILLIE +++$+++ Son?
L526084 +++$+++ u7798 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ MILLIE +++$+++ We should leave this town. I can't take this anymore. I'm not gonna let him kill you in my house.
L526083 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Millie, I know what I'm doing.
L526082 +++$+++ u7798 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ MILLIE +++$+++ You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
L526081 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
L526080 +++$+++ u7798 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ MILLIE +++$+++ I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
L526079 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
L526078 +++$+++ u7798 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ MILLIE +++$+++ He's the guy Buzz.
L526054 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Clam it!
L526053 +++$+++ u7798 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ MILLIE +++$+++ Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin!
L526603 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I gotta go. Love ya mom.
L526602 +++$+++ u7793 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
L526601 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.
L526600 +++$+++ u7793 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ He's dead, isn't he.  Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.
L526599 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I found dad.
L526598 +++$+++ u7793 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
L526597 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Hello, mom?
L526596 +++$+++ u7793 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Hello?
L526345 +++$+++ u7794 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I'll tell you one thing, you won't see me around that alley with that freak on the loose. Stay away from his ass - and don't play any of his fuckin' knock-knock jokes.
L526344 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Uh...over easy.
L526343 +++$+++ u7794 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I was a pi–ata. If nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped. He woulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just snapped. How do you like your burger?
L526342 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ How's that?
L526341 +++$+++ u7794 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Hey man, welcome to our parking lot. Lemme give you some advice, if she asks you to dance, make sure her brother's not around. Somebody blew out Junior's pilot light, if you get my meaning.
L526340 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Theo. Howzitgoin.
L526339 +++$+++ u7794 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Cool!
L526338 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Don't tell me, John.
L526563 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I don't want to play.
L526562 +++$+++ u7795 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. 
L526561 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What did you do to Buzz?
L526560 +++$+++ u7795 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
L526559 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.
L526558 +++$+++ u7795 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
L526557 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
L526556 +++$+++ u7795 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ You shouldn't touch her.
L526555 +++$+++ u7795 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ JUNIOR!  You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.
L526553 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Who's there?
L526552 +++$+++ u7795 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right.  Knock-knock.
L526551 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Buzz Fazeli.
L526550 +++$+++ u7795 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ Who's there!
L526549 +++$+++ u7795 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ Who's there?
L526548 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Knock-knock.
L526483 +++$+++ u7795 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
L526482 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ It depends.
L526481 +++$+++ u7795 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
L526480 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I don't like to talk about it.
L526494 +++$+++ u7795 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ J'you-and-your-friend do it yet? 
L526493 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Junior who?
L526492 +++$+++ u7795 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ Junior.
L526491 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Who's there?
L526490 +++$+++ u7795 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ Come on Sheila, knock-knock.
L526475 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?
L526474 +++$+++ u7795 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
L526401 +++$+++ u7795 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ Blueface! Blueface is my favorite.
L526400 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
L526399 +++$+++ u7795 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ Someone wants to play with me?
L526398 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ I have someone for you to play with Junior.
L526394 +++$+++ u7795 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ You made me hurt him!
L526393 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ We're having a party for you, boy. Cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light.
L526392 +++$+++ u7795 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
L526391 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for you, son. The beam of light catches Junior's face. He is crouched inside the machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy.
L526317 +++$+++ u7795 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ SHEILA!
L526316 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ Junior's a problem child. He has a thing about -
L526512 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ I want you two to pick up Buzz and bring him to lane six. Junior will take it from there.
L526511 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ No!
L526510 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other.
L526508 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen. 
L526507 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.
L526269 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ If I find out Buzz is comin' up short on dwarf bowling, it's lights out for him and pink slips for you. Sid and Breeze look sideways at each other.
L526268 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Someone gonna get kacked, boss?
L526265 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ It's not an "Alley". I hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common! I prefer "Bowling Center".
L526264 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.
L526614 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
L526613 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Where's Junior?
L526517 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
L526516 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
L526312 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ I like you, Theo. You bowl with soul.
L526311 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Why would you help me?
L526310 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
L526309 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ How Mr. Kastle?
L526308 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.  Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  I think I could help you, Theo.
L526307 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I like the sport the way it is.
L526306 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
L526305 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What ever happened to just bowling?
L526304 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.
L526303 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ He's earned an early retirement.  But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future.  I wanna show you something.
L526302 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What if he wants to get out?
L526301 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.
L526300 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Nice set-up.
L526299 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ Profits down there, philanthropy up here.  Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.
L526298 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ Think of this business like a big aquarium. You gotta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top. 
L526293 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ?  Now go take out your "big four", darling.  Come on, we're making her nervous.
L526292 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.
L526284 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance.  How's Gloria's thumb?
L526283 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
L526282 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
L526281 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
L526280 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
L526279 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.
L526278 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You know who I am?
L526277 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.
L526522 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ Bowling "Center"!
L526521 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Don't go near the bowling alley.
L526496 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ You still got the touch Junior.
L526495 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ Fantastic! What talent.
L526487 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! I can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that.  Sheila and Kastle sit up.
L526486 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Leave him alone!
L526485 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ Look who's talking!
L526484 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!
L526478 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ She ran away to be with that...  that Motocross champion.
L526477 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
L526476 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ You're just like you mother! Always jealous!
L526473 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
L526472 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ After we eat, Dad.
