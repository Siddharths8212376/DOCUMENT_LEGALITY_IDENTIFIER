L447813 +++$+++ u2497 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BIFF +++$+++ What?
L447812 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You want to get out of here?
L447811 +++$+++ u2497 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BIFF +++$+++ Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
L447802 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Oh you bet.  Will you excuse me for a sec?
L447801 +++$+++ u2497 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BIFF +++$+++ I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?
L447800 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Oh, gosh no.
L447799 +++$+++ u2497 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BIFF +++$+++ So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
L447798 +++$+++ u2497 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BIFF +++$+++ Hunh?  Oh, right ...
L447797 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
L447796 +++$+++ u2497 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BIFF +++$+++ ... And you always seemed so smart and everything. Like that report you did on "Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know what I'd talk to you about.
L447790 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
L447789 +++$+++ u2497 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BIFF +++$+++ Oh yeah.
L447788 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Really Biff? The keenest?
L447787 +++$+++ u2497 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BIFF +++$+++ I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
L447786 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.
L447785 +++$+++ u2497 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BIFF +++$+++ I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.
L447689 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Um ... It's ...
L447688 +++$+++ u2497 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BIFF +++$+++ What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
L447900 +++$+++ u2497 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BIFF +++$+++ Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.
L447899 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What'll it be?
L447728 +++$+++ u2497 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BIFF +++$+++ I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...
L447727 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
L447726 +++$+++ u2497 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BIFF +++$+++ She won't go out with me?
L447725 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately ...
L447724 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Lucky guess.  Look, Biff ... I don't think it's a real good time for that right now ...
L447723 +++$+++ u2497 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BIFF +++$+++ Yeah ... How'd you know?
L447722 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
L447721 +++$+++ u2497 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BIFF +++$+++ What's the matter?
L447720 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I don't believe it.
L447719 +++$+++ u2497 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BIFF +++$+++ What?
L447718 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Oh God! Are we in that episode?
L448509 +++$+++ u2498 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BIG BOB +++$+++ No it couldn't!
L448508 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ But it could happen.
L448507 +++$+++ u2498 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BIG BOB +++$+++ That's not going to happen!
L448506 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
L448494 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her?
L448493 +++$+++ u2498 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BIG BOB +++$+++ Okay, that's IT!!!
L448492 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too.  You might even call it "love."
L448267 +++$+++ u2504 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."
L448266 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ What happened?
L448263 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Real rain?
L448262 +++$+++ u2504 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Rain.
L448261 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Are you alright?  What is it?
L448067 +++$+++ u2504 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Oh sure ... You bet.  Betty ...
L448066 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
L448065 +++$+++ u2504 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
L448064 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
L448063 +++$+++ u2504 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ No. Of course not.
L448062 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
L448061 +++$+++ u2504 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Thank you very much.
L448060 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ...
L448055 +++$+++ u2504 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ ... How?
L448054 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
L448053 +++$+++ u2504 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?
L448052 +++$+++ u2504 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ One of those ... big beds?
L448051 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
L448050 +++$+++ u2504 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ No. What?
L448049 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ "Changes."  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
L448048 +++$+++ u2504 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ "Changes."
L448047 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town.  You know what I mean by "changes"?
L448045 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I'm fine--but thank you.
L448044 +++$+++ u2504 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
L448043 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Oh, no thanks ...
L448042 +++$+++ u2504 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Want some bridge mix?
L448504 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ No it isn't.
L448503 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Oh sure it is.
L448502 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ It's not in ME.
L448501 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
L448500 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
L448499 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.
L448498 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
L448497 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Why am I out of order?
L448496 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
L448476 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm not lying ... Here I'll show you.
L448475 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ You're not allowed to lie.
L448474 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
L448473 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Okay--that's enough!
L448472 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ See, I know you want it to stay "Pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ...  And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
L448470 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Sure. Everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win.
L448469 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ The basketball team?
L448468 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ It's like the basketball team.
L448465 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Very well ...
L448464 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I think I've got something to say.
L448461 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Very well. Let the record show that the defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the charges.
L448460 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ It was accessible to everyone.
L448459 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
L448458 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Well--it was dark out ...
L448457 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?
L448456 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ We prefer to keep these proceedings as "pleasant" as possible. I don't think a lawyer will be necessary.
L448455 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
L448454 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall:  Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.
L448423 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Still doesn't make it right.
L448422 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
L448421 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
L448420 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
L448419 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yes I do.
L448418 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Do you know that it's illegal?
L448417 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yes I did.
L448416 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Did you do this?
L448429 +++$+++ u2501 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Oh. guess I could do that, then.
L448428 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
L448427 +++$+++ u2501 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Well, I never had to do it before.
L448426 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ What do you mean!?
L448425 +++$+++ u2501 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
L448424 +++$+++ u2499 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Dan! Arrest them!
L448025 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I thought the books were blank?
L448024 +++$+++ u2500 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ "It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see."
L448015 +++$+++ u2500 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ What is it?
L448014 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
L448013 +++$+++ u2500 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ What's outside of Pleasantville?
L448012 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
L448011 +++$+++ u2500 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ And where's that?
L448009 +++$+++ u2500 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ How'd you know how to put it out and all?
L448008 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What?
L448007 +++$+++ u2500 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ How'd you know about the fire?
L448483 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ The one in your mind. The one that you see on a bright cold morning. The one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare.
L448482 +++$+++ u2510 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. SIMPSON +++$+++ The other one?
L448481 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No, not that hedge. The other one.
L448480 +++$+++ u2510 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. SIMPSON +++$+++ Green.
L448479 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What color is that hedge of yours?
L448478 +++$+++ u2510 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. SIMPSON +++$+++ Yes.
L448477 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Mr. Simpson ...
L447674 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
L447673 +++$+++ u2510 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. SIMPSON +++$+++ Hear your Dad got a new car.
L447672 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Hello Mr. Simpson.
L447671 +++$+++ u2510 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. SIMPSON +++$+++ Hello Bud.
L448520 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.
L448519 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ And you're sure about this?
L448518 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Right here.
L448517 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You got the admissions letter.
L448516 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Honestly ... no.
L448515 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there?
L448514 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
L448513 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ This thing works. We could go home right now.
L448512 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I told you. I'm like positive.
L448511 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Are you sure?
L448161 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ What?
L448160 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ...
L448159 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
L448158 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What?
L448157 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ How come I'm still in black and white?
L448156 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yes.
L448155 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Can I ask you a question?
L448154 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Wow.
L448153 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
L448152 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
L448151 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ No. She really liked you.
L448150 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
L448149 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Yeah ...
L448148 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
L448147 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Sure.
L448146 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Well ... I just ...  Can I ask you a question?
L448145 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ So what is it?
L448144 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ That's great.
L448143 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
L448142 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ ... Yeah.
L448141 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
L448140 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
L448139 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You're reading?
L448137 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Nothing?
L448136 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Nothing.
L448135 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ What's wrong?
L448029 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ But like only up to the part about the raft, because I didn't read any farther.
L448028 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ The pages filled in?
L448027 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. They asked me what it was about and I like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, But I told them what I DID remember, and the next thing I knew the pages had filled in.
L448004 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Sure.
L448003 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ...
L448002 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ It's fine.
L448001 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Not directly anyhow ...
L448000 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ It's okay.
L447999 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I had nothing to do with that fire.
L447902 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Really? It seems so fattening.
L447901 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Me too. Sounds swell.
L447891 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Um--hello? You want to like take a look?
L447890 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ They don't have that kind of potential.
L447889 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
L447888 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I just don't think we have the right to ...
L447887 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it.  Oh God! I am just so personally horrified right now ...
L447886 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
