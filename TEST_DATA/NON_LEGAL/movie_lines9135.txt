L282698 +++$+++ u1339 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KNIGHT +++$+++ I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.
L282697 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ What's the point!  You have me, finish it!
L282696 +++$+++ u1339 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KNIGHT +++$+++ This isn't done.  Get up.
L282695 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ What's the point?
L282687 +++$+++ u1339 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KNIGHT +++$+++ As you wish.
L282686 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Leave her out of this.
L282685 +++$+++ u1339 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KNIGHT +++$+++ You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
L282112 +++$+++ u1339 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KNIGHT +++$+++ MACLEOD!
L282111 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Run!
L282103 +++$+++ u1339 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KNIGHT +++$+++ I do hope she enjoys a good show.
L282102 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Of sorts.
L282101 +++$+++ u1339 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KNIGHT +++$+++ Friend of yours?
L282100 +++$+++ u1339 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KNIGHT +++$+++ My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
L282099 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ You've been here from the start.
L282098 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Not so long.
L282097 +++$+++ u1339 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KNIGHT +++$+++ Long time.
L282679 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Should I care?
L282678 +++$+++ u1340 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KNIGHT'S VOICE +++$+++ Yes laddie, I have her.
L282677 +++$+++ u1340 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KNIGHT'S VOICE +++$+++ Give me an address where I can forward Miss Cart- wright's head.
L282676 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ And if I refuse?
L282675 +++$+++ u1340 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KNIGHT'S VOICE +++$+++ I want you to come to me.
L282674 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Are you here?
L282673 +++$+++ u1340 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KNIGHT'S VOICE +++$+++ We have some unfinished business.
L282078 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ I've got all the time in the world.  Except right now.  If you will excuse me, Lieutenant.
L282077 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ All I need is time.
L282076 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Do you?
L282075 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.
L282074 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ He's mistaken.
L282073 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ A neighbor saw your car leave.
L282072 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Home.
L282071 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Where were you Tuesday night?
L282070 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ My condolences.
L281911 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ For the moment.
L281910 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ A mystery.
L281909 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
L281908 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Your murder weapon?
L281907 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
L281906 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ I presume it's a sword.
L281905 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Do you know what this is?
L281904 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ You're wrong.
L281903 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ That's none of your business.
L281902 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ What were _you_ looking for?
L281901 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Let's just say that in my years with this department I've seen more than one well dressed business man look for a hand job on 14th Street.
L281900 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ What are you getting at?
L281899 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh- borhood at night?
L281898 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ American.
L281897 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in the country less than a week.  What is your citizenship?
L281896 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ He was carrying a Syrian passport and had been in the country less than a week.
L281895 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ It doesn't.
L281894 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
L281893 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ No.
L281892 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Did you know the victim?
L281891 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after.
L281890 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Mr.-  Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
L281889 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Yes.
L281888 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ This your present address?
L281919 +++$+++ u1346 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ They were Steven, they were.  It's been a miracle it has.  He lasted right through and healed.  No one in the village has ever seen anything like it.  Ever.
L281918 +++$+++ u1353 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TRAVELLER +++$+++ But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
L281917 +++$+++ u1346 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Steven, Conor didn't die.
L281916 +++$+++ u1353 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TRAVELLER +++$+++ I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
L281915 +++$+++ u1346 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ You're a kind man to be sure.
L281914 +++$+++ u1353 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TRAVELLER +++$+++ I only just heard of Conor.  I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.
L281913 +++$+++ u1346 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Ah Steven, it is good to see you.
L282581 +++$+++ u1347 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MR. NORTH +++$+++ Just your pappy scared some.
L282580 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Nothing to be sorry about.
L282510 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ I'm sure that's true.
L282509 +++$+++ u1347 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MR. NORTH +++$+++ Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
L282508 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ No.
L282507 +++$+++ u1347 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MR. NORTH +++$+++ Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
L282506 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Same.
L282505 +++$+++ u1347 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MR. NORTH +++$+++ Morning Mr. North
L282211 +++$+++ u1347 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MR. NORTH +++$+++ I'll send them right up.
L282210 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ When may I expect the cleaners?
L282209 +++$+++ u1347 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MR. NORTH +++$+++ The resemblance is amazing.
L282208 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ We were very close.
L282207 +++$+++ u1347 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MR. NORTH +++$+++ Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.
L282206 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ His only kid.
L282205 +++$+++ u1347 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MR. NORTH +++$+++ You're one of William's kids, huh?
L282203 +++$+++ u1347 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MR. NORTH +++$+++ Oh yes, more than enough.
L282202 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
L282201 +++$+++ u1347 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MR. NORTH +++$+++ When your father died I saw to it that the grounds were kept up.
L283758 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ And to prove to the voters that the Red Menace is on the level, the Sheriff has written himself four more letters, threatening his life. I know he wrote 'em on account of the misspellings.
L283757 +++$+++ u1355 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BENSINGER +++$+++ The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
L283756 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
L283755 +++$+++ u1355 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BENSINGER +++$+++ A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
L283754 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging.
L283735 +++$+++ u1355 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BENSINGER +++$+++ Why don't you fellows get your own news?
L283734 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?
L284536 +++$+++ u1355 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BENSINGER +++$+++ Open this door!
L284535 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
L284533 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ That's Bensinger. That's his desk.
L284532 +++$+++ u1355 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BENSINGER +++$+++ What's the idea of locking this?
L284531 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Who is it?
L283742 +++$+++ u1355 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BENSINGER +++$+++ Well, congratulations! Good luck!
L283741 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ I'm getting married tomorrow.
L283740 +++$+++ u1355 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BENSINGER +++$+++ What doing?
L283739 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
L283738 +++$+++ u1355 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BENSINGER +++$+++ Are you back?
L283737 +++$+++ u1355 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BENSINGER +++$+++ Hildy!
L283736 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
L284568 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Bon jour!
L284567 +++$+++ u1355 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BENSINGER +++$+++ Au revoir, mon capitaine.
L284566 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ I'll keep you in mind.
L284564 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ It doesn't have to rhyme!
L284563 +++$+++ u1355 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BENSINGER +++$+++ I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
L284562 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Exactly!
L284561 +++$+++ u1355 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BENSINGER +++$+++ Sort of a Jack London style?
L284560 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Let him have everything he wants.  Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.  He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay!
L284559 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ I'll give you a hundred and a by- line.
L284558 +++$+++ u1355 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BENSINGER +++$+++ Seventy-five.
L284557 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
L284556 +++$+++ u1355 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BENSINGER +++$+++ No. Roy. Roy V.
L284555 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you.  Mervyn, isn't it?
L284552 +++$+++ u1355 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BENSINGER +++$+++ What?
L284551 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
L284550 +++$+++ u1355 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BENSINGER +++$+++ Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."
L284549 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ The poem?... The poem was great!
L284548 +++$+++ u1355 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BENSINGER +++$+++ Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
L284547 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
L284546 +++$+++ u1355 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BENSINGER +++$+++ Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.
L284545 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.
L284544 +++$+++ u1355 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BENSINGER +++$+++ How do you mean?
L284541 +++$+++ u1355 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BENSINGER +++$+++ Excuse me, I just want to --
L284540 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Hello, Bensinger.
L284539 +++$+++ u1355 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BENSINGER +++$+++ Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here.
L284495 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Fine.
L284494 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station.
L284491 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ You got it back, eh? There's something funny going on around here.
L284490 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back.
L284487 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Thank you.
L284486 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.
L284485 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Oh, yes. Here it is.
L284484 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
L284483 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
L284482 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Did you give her the money?
L284481 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
L284480 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Hildy! Where's mother?
L284479 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Out some place.
L284478 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Where'd she go?
L284477 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Oh, she was here.
L284468 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  Walter!
L284467 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.
L284466 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ We'll explain the whole thing to them. 
L284465 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail...  I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!
L284461 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Bruce, I know, but I was in the biggest jam --
L284460 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
L284459 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
L284458 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Hello, Bruce...
L284457 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Hildy!
L283976 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Well, the story's practically finished. I'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger.
L283975 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
L283974 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
L283973 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ The Criminal Courts Building.
L283972 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Did you finish the interview?
L283971 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
L283970 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.
L283969 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
L283968 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.
L283967 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ I'm sure you haven't any.
L283966 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
L283965 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Yes, wasn't it?
L283964 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ That's right here. Gee, it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper superstition.
L283963 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ The check, Bruce!
L283962 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I lost my wallet.
L283961 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ What's the matter?
L283806 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
L283805 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
L283799 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.
L283798 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
L283693 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.
L283692 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
L283691 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.
L283690 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ But I don't gamble, Hilda!
L283689 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
L283688 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ But --
L283687 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
L283686 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ The five hundred? Sure.
L283685 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
L283684 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ All right, dear.
L283679 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Better make that a certified check, Walter.
L283678 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ About twenty-five hundred dollars.
L283673 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I could get a company doctor in twenty minutes.
L283672 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?

L283670 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
L283669 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
L283668 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
L283667 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
L283632 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ He certainly -- hic -- does!
L283631 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
L283630 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ No. It's strong.  But I like it that way.
L283629 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Too hot?
L283624 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
L283623 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
L283622 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
L283621 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.
L283620 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
L283619 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.
L283585 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
L283584 +++$+++ u1356 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Oh, it isn't like that.
