L556539 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
L556538 +++$+++ u7985 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ First paycheck?
L556537 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Sonofagun! Look at this here!
L557240 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Join the party, genius! Come on up!
L557239 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got --  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!
L557211 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
L557210 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ You want to mess with Superman?
L557168 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
L557167 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
L557166 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
L557165 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Can you do that?
L557164 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
L557163 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
L557162 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Exactly. Stoned mother.
L557161 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Stone mutha.
L557160 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking "get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it.
L557159 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ I told you it wasn't no jive.
L557158 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
L557157 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Yeah? How's it look?
L557126 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Tell me more...
L557125 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Anything.
L557124 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ What will it get me?
L557123 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Everything.
L557122 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ What will it do?
L557121 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
L557120 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ You designed it?
L557119 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
L557118 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ We've already got some.
L557117 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ A computer.
L557116 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ For what?
L557115 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.
L557114 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ What do you want?
L557113 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Fair's fair.
L557112 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Is this whitemail?
L557111 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
L557110 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Is this blackmail?
L557109 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Don't lay that jail number on me no more. You need me out here doin' stuff for you more'n sitten' in no jail doin' nothin' for nobody.  'Sides, I be known' some heavy stuff about you now. You don't want em spillin' the coffee beans.
L557108 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
L557107 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Now...when do I get a taste?
L557105 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ The moon! Listen, man, when I was a little bitty kid all my friends got them electric trains for Christmas. My mama didn't have barely enough to pay the electric bill, let alone buy me no train set.
L557104 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
L557103 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!
L557102 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Thanks, kiddo. now, listen, this part's important. I want you to program one special command into all these systems. Tell them these orders are irreversible, so it'll be impossible for anybody to switch them back. Can you do that, pal?
L557101 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
L557100 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ And then shut down the pipe lines.
L557096 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ You catch on fast, old buddy.  Tell him about the pumps. I know how you love the part about the pumps.
L557095 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
L557094 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ And do nothing. Just sit there.
L557091 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Yes, but they don't really need them. it's just a throw- back to some sentimental sea- faring baloney.
L557090 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ They ain't got captains?
L557089 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
L557081 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Huh?
L557080 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ KRYPTONITE!
L557079 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ He sure wasn't actin' bad and nasty that day in Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of...
L557017 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Greed!  Let me tell you something---
L557016 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
L557015 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
L557014 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ God, that's what I keep you for.
L557013 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
L557010 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Wait a second. Astronomers know where the planet used to be, right? And you know what happens when a planet explodes? Debris. Pieces floating in space.
L557009 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ It ain't. It's nowhere. It blew up. That's how come they shipped the dude to Earth when he was a baby.  well. I know some stuff too, y'all.
L556983 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ What are you talking about, fella?
L556982 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Uh...what channel were you watching?
L556981 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ I did. isn't it neat-o?
L556980 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Turn on the T.V.
L556979 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Just the man I wanted to see!
L556978 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Hey, boss.
L556816 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.
L556815 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ What?
L556814 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ First question got to be "Where."
L556813 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ When?
L556812 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
L556811 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
L556786 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.
L556785 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ How do you do that?
L556779 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ That what they call you?
L556778 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
L556775 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Me? How?
L556774 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."  And you are going to do it for me.
L556773 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
L556768 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
L556767 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Wipe 'em out?
L556766 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Columbia's got two major exports and one of them's coffee. 
L556765 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Columbia.
L556764 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Columbia.
L556763 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Which country?
L556762 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me.  You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?
L556761 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Decaffeinated too?
L556760 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!
L556758 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
L556757 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Man, what is this?
L556756 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ I don't think you understand.
L556755 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Black or regular?
L556754 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!
L556753 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ I'm tryin' to.
L556752 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow?
L556748 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ 'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
L556747 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
L556746 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Or socks.
L556745 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
L556744 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
L556743 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
L556742 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Uh...
L556741 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- "dig where you're comin' from."  You want to be rich, right?
L556740 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
L556739 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ You've been a naughty boy haven't you?  C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.
L556738 +++$+++ u7994 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...
L556737 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and...
L557300 +++$+++ u7996 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Suit yourself, Gus.  Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?
L557299 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
L557298 +++$+++ u7996 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Thanks.  Let's go
L557293 +++$+++ u7996 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Just a second.
L557292 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Whatcha wanna stop here for?  Not that I ain't glad to be on the ground, y'understand.
L557291 +++$+++ u7996 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ No...I just have a little stop to make.
L557290 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ We back in Metropolis?
L557289 +++$+++ u7996 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
L557288 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ We gonna crash?
L557287 +++$+++ u7996 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ No, we're just going down.
L557286 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Watch out for them air pockets!
L557285 +++$+++ u7996 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
L557284 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
L557283 +++$+++ u7996 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Hey, you're perfectly safe.
L557282 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
L557281 +++$+++ u7996 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ How you doing down there?
L557099 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Will you stop interrupting ?!  You will command the pumps to stop pumping.
L557098 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ I know, by computers.
L557093 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ And do what?
L557092 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
L556803 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ What she call you?
L556802 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
L556801 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
L556777 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Sister! I'm his sister!
L556776 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
L556796 +++$+++ u7987 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ It was hot!
L556795 +++$+++ u7992 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
L556794 +++$+++ u7987 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Why do I have to do this?
L556525 +++$+++ u7987 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures.  The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
L556524 +++$+++ u7992 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ What about you?
L556523 +++$+++ u7987 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ What about me?
L556522 +++$+++ u7992 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ All right, Kent. I just hope you know what you're doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for it.
L556487 +++$+++ u7992 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ A photographer eats with his camera, A Photographer sleeps with his camera --
L556486 +++$+++ u7987 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I didn't have my camera with me.
L556485 +++$+++ u7992 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!
L556482 +++$+++ u7987 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ That's his sister. Vera Webster.
L556481 +++$+++ u7992 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Who's the other woman?
L556479 +++$+++ u7987 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
L556478 +++$+++ u7992 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Who is she?
L557065 +++$+++ u7996 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ The bridge...?  I'd better get going!
L557064 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
L557063 +++$+++ u7996 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:
L557062 +++$+++ u7996 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Hey, Don't I always get there in time?  Come on, relax.
L557061 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ But the bridge...
L557060 +++$+++ u7996 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ There's no rush.
L557057 +++$+++ u7996 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ You just did, with that great dinner.
L557056 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.
L557039 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
L557038 +++$+++ u7996 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.
L556873 +++$+++ u7996 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.  See you around, pal.
L556872 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
L556871 +++$+++ u7996 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ We've already met.
L556870 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
L556869 +++$+++ u7996 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Anytime.
L556868 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ Thank ...you.
L556867 +++$+++ u7996 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
L556866 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ Ricky?  Where...what...
L557332 +++$+++ u7989 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
L557331 +++$+++ u7992 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?
L556527 +++$+++ u7992 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
L556526 +++$+++ u7989 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.
L556504 +++$+++ u7989 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Whoopee.
L556503 +++$+++ u7992 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.

L556484 +++$+++ u7989 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ The picture's fine. That's the way she looks in real life.
L556483 +++$+++ u7992 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ The picture looks blurry.
L557245 +++$+++ u7996 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ That wasn't me. That guy's gone.  And you're next Webster.
L557244 +++$+++ u7990 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LORELEI +++$+++ But the other night...
L557243 +++$+++ u7996 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ I don't know you, lady.
L557144 +++$+++ u7990 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LORELEI +++$+++ It isn't much, really, you see, there's this little boat. Well, not so little, really. And it's not going where it's supposed to go and...
L557143 +++$+++ u7996 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
L557142 +++$+++ u7990 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LORELEI +++$+++ Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
L557141 +++$+++ u7996 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
L557140 +++$+++ u7990 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LORELEI +++$+++ I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first.
L557139 +++$+++ u7996 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Tell me.
L557138 +++$+++ u7990 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LORELEI +++$+++ Lots of things...
L557137 +++$+++ u7996 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?
L557136 +++$+++ u7990 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LORELEI +++$+++ Well, don't let me keep you from anything.
L557135 +++$+++ u7990 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LORELEI +++$+++ Don't worry. I'm long past saving.
L557134 +++$+++ u7996 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
L557133 +++$+++ u7990 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LORELEI +++$+++ I thought you'd never get here.
L557266 +++$+++ u7990 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LORELEI +++$+++ But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!
L557265 +++$+++ u7997 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ I can't! It's out of control!
L557234 +++$+++ u7990 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LORELEI +++$+++ He can have mine. Anytime.
