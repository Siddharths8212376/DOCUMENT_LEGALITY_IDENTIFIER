L491270 +++$+++ u2656 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MISTY +++$+++ It's him!
L491269 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. 
L491268 +++$+++ u2656 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MISTY +++$+++ I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
L491198 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
L491197 +++$+++ u2656 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MISTY +++$+++ Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.
L491062 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ We all have bad nights. 
L491061 +++$+++ u2656 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MISTY +++$+++ He killed people, Mom.
L491046 +++$+++ u2656 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MISTY +++$+++ Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
L491045 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ And who may I ask is Carl?
L491042 +++$+++ u2656 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MISTY +++$+++ Sorry, Mom. Thanks.  Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice.
L491041 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing... 
L491040 +++$+++ u2656 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MISTY +++$+++ It's sugarless.
L491039 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
L491038 +++$+++ u2656 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MISTY +++$+++ I do, please.
L491037 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Who wants fruit salad?
L491671 +++$+++ u2661 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MRS. ACKERMAN +++$+++ No...  I don't have room in my kitchen...
L491670 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
L491669 +++$+++ u2661 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MRS. ACKERMAN +++$+++ Yes... but... I didn't...
L491668 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
L491667 +++$+++ u2661 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MRS. ACKERMAN +++$+++ Yes, but I lent it...
L491666 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
L491665 +++$+++ u2661 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MRS. ACKERMAN +++$+++ NO! I could never hurt anyone!
L491664 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
L491663 +++$+++ u2661 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MRS. ACKERMAN +++$+++ I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
L491662 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
L491661 +++$+++ u2661 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MRS. ACKERMAN +++$+++ ...Browsing.
L491660 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?
L491377 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Ewwww!  Thank you, Rosemary.
L491376 +++$+++ u2661 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MRS. ACKERMAN +++$+++ Beverly, honey, you've got some...  ...do-do on your shoe.
L491366 +++$+++ u2661 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MRS. ACKERMAN +++$+++ If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale.
L491365 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ You want me to keep that under the table for you?
L491364 +++$+++ u2661 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MRS. ACKERMAN +++$+++ I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
L491363 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
L491228 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ I'm not that bad a driver.  Look at her hair!  Turn it off, honey.
L491227 +++$+++ u2661 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MRS. ACKERMAN +++$+++ That's like your car, Beverly,
L491143 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Who on earth would want to harass poor Dottie Hinkle?
L491142 +++$+++ u2661 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MRS. ACKERMAN +++$+++ Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
L491141 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?
L491140 +++$+++ u2661 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MRS. ACKERMAN +++$+++ It's the least I could do.  I heard shouting.
L491139 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering.
L491138 +++$+++ u2661 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MRS. ACKERMAN +++$+++ Beverly, are you alright?
L491167 +++$+++ u2660 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MR. STUBBINS +++$+++ Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
L491166 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
L491165 +++$+++ u2660 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MR. STUBBINS +++$+++ Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
L491164 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Certainly not!
L491163 +++$+++ u2660 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MR. STUBBINS +++$+++ That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
L491162 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ He is assistant manager of a video shop...
L491161 +++$+++ u2660 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MR. STUBBINS +++$+++ His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
L491160 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
L491159 +++$+++ u2660 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MR. STUBBINS +++$+++ There is one big problem though.
L491158 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ He's a good boy.
L491157 +++$+++ u2660 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MR. STUBBINS +++$+++ Chip is off to a fine start this year.  Focused... conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion.
L491156 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Bon Appetit!
L491155 +++$+++ u2660 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MR. STUBBINS +++$+++ Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
L491154 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
L491153 +++$+++ u2660 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MR. STUBBINS +++$+++ Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.
L491152 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Right here!
L491151 +++$+++ u2660 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MR. STUBBINS +++$+++ Mrs... Sutphin?
L491293 +++$+++ u2664 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ SCOTTY +++$+++ Now, here's a babe!
L491292 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Murder, honey.
L491289 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.
L491288 +++$+++ u2664 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ SCOTTY +++$+++ SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
L491187 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Yes you are.
L491186 +++$+++ u2664 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ SCOTTY +++$+++ Are we leaving?
L491185 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ You forgot something...
L491184 +++$+++ u2664 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ SCOTTY +++$+++ Man, that one made me puke!
L491176 +++$+++ u2664 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ SCOTTY +++$+++ Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.
L491175 +++$+++ u2657 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!
L491433 +++$+++ u2663 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MRS. STERNER +++$+++ We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
L491432 +++$+++ u2659 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MR. STERNER +++$+++ What is it, Betty?
L491429 +++$+++ u2663 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MRS. STERNER +++$+++ How to send a bill!!
L491428 +++$+++ u2659 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MR. STERNER +++$+++ What's he know?
L491427 +++$+++ u2663 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MRS. STERNER +++$+++ Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
L491426 +++$+++ u2659 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MR. STERNER +++$+++ I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
L491425 +++$+++ u2663 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MRS. STERNER +++$+++ What was that?
L491362 +++$+++ u2665 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ VENDOR +++$+++ Nice one, huh? Winter's coming.  Three dollars?... I guess that's what I marked it...
L491361 +++$+++ u2661 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MRS. ACKERMAN +++$+++ I'll take this instead.
L491360 +++$+++ u2661 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MRS. ACKERMAN +++$+++ Eight dollars?! Franklin Mint or not, it's damaged goods! 
L491359 +++$+++ u2665 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ VENDOR +++$+++ That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
L491358 +++$+++ u2661 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MRS. ACKERMAN +++$+++ I'll give you fifty cents.
L491357 +++$+++ u2665 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ VENDOR +++$+++ Yes, ma'am, it is.
L491356 +++$+++ u2661 +++$+++ m173 +++$+++ MRS. ACKERMAN +++$+++ Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
L496342 +++$+++ u2667 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ AUGUST +++$+++ Okay, Mr. Radeau, it's forgot.
L496341 +++$+++ u2685 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ RADEAU +++$+++ That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson. I'd forget it if I were you.
L496340 +++$+++ u2667 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ AUGUST +++$+++ Yeah —- sure.
L496339 +++$+++ u2685 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ RADEAU +++$+++ Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.
L496338 +++$+++ u2667 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ AUGUST +++$+++ Sure I do.
L496337 +++$+++ u2685 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ RADEAU +++$+++ You know who I am, August?
L496403 +++$+++ u2667 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ AUGUST +++$+++ Listen ——
L496402 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You could go and open the door.
L496401 +++$+++ u2667 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ AUGUST +++$+++ We can't stand here all night.
L496400 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No.
L496399 +++$+++ u2667 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ AUGUST +++$+++ I'd like to get out of here.
L496398 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It's only a little way, Mr. August.
L496396 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No.
L496395 +++$+++ u2667 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ AUGUST +++$+++ Let's get out of here.
L496394 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yes.
L496393 +++$+++ u2667 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ AUGUST +++$+++ You scared?
L496392 +++$+++ u2667 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ AUGUST +++$+++ It's the last door at the end of this hall.
L496391 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Which room is it?
L496390 +++$+++ u2667 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ AUGUST +++$+++ I don't like this.
L496389 +++$+++ u2667 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ AUGUST +++$+++ I don't know if I want to go with you or not.
L496388 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
L496387 +++$+++ u2667 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ AUGUST +++$+++ Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
L496386 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Can we go there now?
L496385 +++$+++ u2667 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ AUGUST +++$+++ You can't tell.
L496384 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You think my sister is there?
L496383 +++$+++ u2667 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ AUGUST +++$+++ That's what I tried to find out.	I went to La Jeunesse ——  -- used a phony health inspector's badge —— they let me go through the works -- all but one room. That room was locked. I'd like to see the inside of that room.
L496382 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
L496381 +++$+++ u2667 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ AUGUST +++$+++ That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
L496380 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yes. She bought my sister's business.
L496379 +++$+++ u2667 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ AUGUST +++$+++ Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
L496378 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Where?
L496377 +++$+++ u2667 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ AUGUST +++$+++ Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.
L496376 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
L496375 +++$+++ u2667 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ AUGUST +++$+++ I've been waitin' for you Miss Gibson. I want you to know I've decided to take your case.
L496335 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
L496334 +++$+++ u2667 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ AUGUST +++$+++ Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
L496333 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You can?
L496332 +++$+++ u2667 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ AUGUST +++$+++ The name may not mean anything to you, young lady, but say the word and I'll have your sister for you in forty-eight hours.
L496953 +++$+++ u2668 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ BRUNS +++$+++ You won't get any water and you won't get any rest. You may as well drink.
L496952 +++$+++ u2672 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JACQUELINE +++$+++ No.
L496951 +++$+++ u2668 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ BRUNS +++$+++ Drink.
L496950 +++$+++ u2672 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JACQUELINE +++$+++ May I have some water? I'm thirsty.
L496937 +++$+++ u2668 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ BRUNS +++$+++ It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.
L496936 +++$+++ u2672 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JACQUELINE +++$+++ When I wanted to.
L496933 +++$+++ u2672 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JACQUELINE +++$+++ No.
L496932 +++$+++ u2668 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ BRUNS +++$+++ Then, you also understand that you must die.
L496931 +++$+++ u2672 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JACQUELINE +++$+++ Yes, I understand.
L496930 +++$+++ u2668 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ BRUNS +++$+++ The acceptance of a secret is an obligation and in this case my dear, the obligation carried with it the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret. You understand that don't you?
L496446 +++$+++ u2678 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MISS SUMMERS +++$+++ No. It's my father -- I wanted to talk to you -- you wrote about cures --
L496445 +++$+++ u2669 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ DR. JUDD +++$+++ You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
L496444 +++$+++ u2678 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MISS SUMMERS +++$+++ I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
L496443 +++$+++ u2669 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ DR. JUDD +++$+++ Yes.
L496442 +++$+++ u2678 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MISS SUMMERS +++$+++ Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
L496440 +++$+++ u2669 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ DR. JUDD +++$+++ Thank you.
L496439 +++$+++ u2678 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MISS SUMMERS +++$+++ Mr. Ward will see you in just a few minutes. Won't you wait, Dr. Judd?
L496478 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ What circumstances?
L496477 +++$+++ u2669 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ DR. JUDD +++$+++ She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
L496476 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ But tell me --
L496475 +++$+++ u2669 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ DR. JUDD +++$+++ Oh, as beautiful as ever.
L496474 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Tell me, how is Jacqueline?
L496473 +++$+++ u2669 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ DR. JUDD +++$+++ For the time being, I imagine that must do.
L496472 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ About forty-five dollars.
L496471 +++$+++ u2669 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ DR. JUDD +++$+++ How much have you got?
L496470 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ I haven't got that much in cash.
L496469 +++$+++ u2669 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ DR. JUDD +++$+++ She can only use cash.
L496468 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ I'll give you a check.
L496467 +++$+++ u2669 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ DR. JUDD +++$+++ She could use a hundred dollars.
L496466 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ How much does she want?
L496464 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ But why? She's been ill --erratic, but I've never heard of anything like that!
L496463 +++$+++ u2669 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ DR. JUDD +++$+++ Well, then I can tell you that in addition to other dangers, there is a grave danger of Jacqueline losing her sanity. I would advise against you seeing her.
L496462 +++$+++ u2669 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ DR. JUDD +++$+++ As a man, you distrust me —- perhaps you believe me as a physician.
L496461 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ It's not just for myself I'm asking. Her sister is here. The kid's half crazy with anxiety.
L496460 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ You come to me with some wild story about her being in danger - naturally I want to know what kind of danger. I want to know where she is.
L496459 +++$+++ u2669 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ DR. JUDD +++$+++ You're a curious man. You're willing to jeopardize Jacqueline's life in order to satisfy your own curiosity.
L496456 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ What sort of danger?
L496455 +++$+++ u2669 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ DR. JUDD +++$+++ I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
L496454 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
L496453 +++$+++ u2669 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ DR. JUDD +++$+++  I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
L496452 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ I thought you told me you didn't know where she was.
L496451 +++$+++ u2669 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ DR. JUDD +++$+++ I've come from Jacqueline. She needs money.
L496690 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What is it?
L496689 +++$+++ u2670 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I ought to know.
L496688 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Do you know what this is, Frances?
L496687 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Thank you.
L496686 +++$+++ u2670 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ The tip is, anyhow. I like to work on your hair.
L496683 +++$+++ u2670 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I guess most people are.
L496682 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
L496681 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What does she do with herself after business hours?
L496680 +++$+++ u2670 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ She's a pretty good sort.
L496679 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ She seems rather an odd woman to me.
L496678 +++$+++ u2670 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Redi's all right.
L496677 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
L496676 +++$+++ u2670 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.
L496675 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ But I like teaching school.
L496674 +++$+++ u2670 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.
L496285 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'll try there.
L496284 +++$+++ u2670 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her.  People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
L496283 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ "The Dante?"
L496282 +++$+++ u2670 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village —-	"The Dante."
L496281 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I can't understand it at all.
L496280 +++$+++ u2670 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
L496279 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I know. For the first time I'm beginning to be frightened. I almost feel as if I'd never known my sister.
L496278 +++$+++ u2670 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I don't get this. Miss Jacqueline was always so fond of you -- she was always talking about you -— had your picture in her office.
L496277 +++$+++ u2670 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ You mean Miss Jacqueline's gone, and you don't know where she is?
L496276 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
L496275 +++$+++ u2670 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ How's Miss Jacqueline?
L496274 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Hello, Frances.
L496273 +++$+++ u2670 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Why, Mary --
L496762 +++$+++ u2670 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Yes.
L496761 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding.
L496706 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ You	fool! That symbol is us -- us. She was asking about us.
L496705 +++$+++ u2670 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ She showed me a drawing.
L496704 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ What did she want to know?
L496703 +++$+++ u2670 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ No. She asked about the trademark.
L496702 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ And that was all?
L496701 +++$+++ u2670 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
L496700 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
L496699 +++$+++ u2670 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Nothing.
