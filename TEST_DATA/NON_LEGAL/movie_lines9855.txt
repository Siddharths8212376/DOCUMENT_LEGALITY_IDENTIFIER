L244736 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ How do you know I made it up?
L244733 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ ...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
L244732 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Excuse me...
L244731 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
L244730 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Why I don't...
L244729 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
L244728 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ What are you trying to tell me?
L244727 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Yes, I am.
L244726 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ You are?
L244725 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Yes.  Mmm.  Yes.  Precisely. Precisely. 'Cause your partner depends on it.  I'm talking to you, I'm trying to tell you something.
L244724 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Mmm.
L244723 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
L244722 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Yes.  I hear you.
L244721 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed.  You hear me?  I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...?
L244720 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Mmm.
L244496 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ On an eighty-thousand dollar day? And it ain't even noon.
L244495 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ It's not impossible.
L244494 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Would you?  Would you...?  Or you're gonna what, fire me?
L244493 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ I were you, I'd calm down, Shelly.
L244492 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your "end of month board..." You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
L244491 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
L244490 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ What does that fucking mean?
L244489 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
L244488 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
L244487 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
L244486 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
L244485 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine.
L244484 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Did you tell 'em my sale?
L244483 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
L244482 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Get 'em to me!
L244481 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ The leads are coming.
L244480 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Ah, fuck.  Leads!  Leads! Williamson!  Send me out!  Send me out!
L244370 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Somebody broke in.
L244369 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ What happened?
L243951 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ The deal still stands, our other thing.
L243950 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ That's alright.
L243949 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
L243948 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Is that what you're saying?
L243947 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Yeah.  Yeah.
L243946 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ You want something off the B list?
L243945 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ You want to do business that way...? Alright.  Alright.  Alright. Alright.  What is there on the other list...?
L243944 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Is that it?  Is that it?  You want to do business that way...?
L243943 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Because I say so.
L243942 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Why?
L243941 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ I can't split them.
L243940 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Wait.  Alright.  Fine.  The one.  Give me the lead.  Give me the one lead.  The best one you have.
L243939 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ I have to go... 
L243938 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Well, I want to tell you something, fella, wasn't long I could pick up the phone, call Murray and I'd have your job.  You know that?  Not too long ago.  For what?  For nothing. "Mur, this new kid burns my ass." "Shelly, he's out." You're gone before I'm back from lunch.  I bought him a trip to Bermuda once...
L243937 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ I can't do it, Shelly...
L243936 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
L243935 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ No.
L243934 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel.  John?  We do that, for chrissake?
L243933 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Can't do it.
L243932 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ You fucking asshole.  I haven't got it.  I haven't got it, John.  I'll pay you tomorrow.  I'm coming in here with the sales, I'll pay you tomorrow.  I haven't got it, when I pay, the gas...I get back the hotel, I'll bring it in tomorrow.
L243931 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ I wish I could.
L243929 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Now.  Yes...When?
L243928 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Now?  Now?
L243926 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Good.  Now we're talking.
L243925 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Alright.
L243924 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Bullshit.  They ain't been in the office yet.  Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits in Des Plaines.
L243923 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
L243922 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I saw the board.  You've got four...
L243921 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ I'm not sure I have two.
L243920 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
L243919 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ What are we going to say?
L243918 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ John.  Listen.  I want to talk to you. Permit me to do this a second.  I'm older than you.  A man acquires a reputation.  On the street.  What he does when he's up, what he does otherwise...I said "ten," you said "no." You said "twenty." I said "fine," I'm not going to fuck with you, how can I beat that, you tell me?...Okay.  Okay.  We'll...Okay. Fine.  We'll...Alright, twenty percent, and fifty bucks a lead. That's fine.  For now.  That's fine. A month or two we'll talk.  A month from now.  Next month.  After the thirtieth.  We'll talk.
L243917 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ And fifty bucks a lead.
L243916 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Alright.
L243915 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Twenty percent.
L243914 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck that.  Fuck it...Get on my side. Go with me.  Let's do something. You want to run this office, run it.
L243913 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Not lately you can't...
L243912 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I will close.  John, John, ten percent.  I can get hot.  You know that...
L243911 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ What if you don't?  Then I'm fucked. You see...?  Then it's my job. That's what I'm telling you.
L243910 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I will close.
L243909 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ What if you don't close...?
L243908 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I will close.
L243907 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ And what if you don't close.
L243906 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Of what?
L243904 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ I can't do it, Shel.
L243903 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I can't close these leads, John. No one can.  It's a joke.  John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads.  As a "test," alright?  As a "test" and I promise you...
L243902 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
L243901 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Then put me on the board.
L243900 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ ...apart from the top men on the contest board.
L243899 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
L243898 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ The leads are assigned randomly...
L243897 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Why?
L243895 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ They all kick out.  You run in streaks, pal.  Streaks.  I'm... I'm...don't look at the board, look at me.  Shelly Levene.  Anyone. Ask them on Western.  Ask Getz at Homestead.  Go ask Jerry Graff. You know who I am...I NEED A SHOT. I got to get on the fucking board. Ask them.  Ask them.  Ask them who ever picked up a check I was flush. Moss, Jerry Graff, Mitch himself...Those guys lived on the business I brought in.  They lived on it...and so did Murray, John. You were here you'd of benefited from it too.  And now I'm saying this.  Do I want charity?  Do I want pity?  I want sits.  I want leads that don't come right out of a phone book.  Give me a lead hotter than that, I'll go in and close it.  Give me a chance. That's all I want.  I'm going to get up on that fucking board and all I want is a chance.  It's a streak and I'm going to turn it around.  I need your help.
L243894 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ ...they kicked out.
L243893 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I've seen those leads.  I saw them when I was at Homestead, we pitched those cocksuckers Rio Rancho nineteen sixty-nine they wouldn't buy.  They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.  They're broke, John. They're cold.  They're deadbeats, you can't judge on that.  Even so. Even so.  Alright.  Fine.  Fine. Even so.  I go in, FOUR FUCKING LEADS they got their money in a sock.  They're fucking Polacks, John.  Four leads.  I close two. Two.  Fifty per...
L243892 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I'll tell you why I'm out.  I'm out, you're giving me toilet paper. John. 
L243891 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Yes.
L243890 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I'm out.
L243889 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Either way.  You're out.
L243888 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You don't look at the fucking percentage. You look at the gross.
L243887 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ The...Shelly?  The hot leads are assigned according to the board.  During the contest. Period.  Anyone who beats fifty per...
L243886 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ ...ah, fuck this...
L243885 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Will you please wait a second. Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me: the hot leads...
L243884 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ John.  John...
L243883 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Murray said...
L243882 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Money.  A fortune.  Money lying on the ground.  Murray?  When was the last time he went out on a sit? Sales contest?  It's laughable. It's cold out there now, John. It's tight.  Money is tight.  This ain't sixty-five.  It ain't.  It just ain't.  See?  See?  Now, I'm a good man--but I need a...
L243881 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Fuck him.  Fuck Murray.  John?  You know?  You tell him I said so. What does he fucking know?  He's going to have a "sales" contest...you know what our sales contest used to be? 
L243880 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Murray said...
L243879 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...
L243878 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ You know what those leads cost?
L243877 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something...
L243876 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to watch the leads.  I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy.  My job is to do that.  What I'm told.  That's it.  You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
L243875 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Yes.
L243874 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ ...let me...are you listening to me...?
L243873 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ ...and I'm going to get bounced and you're...
L243872 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Let me...
L243871 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Yes.  I am.  I'm sorry to antagonize you.
L243870 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ You're saying that I'm fucked.
L243869 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Marshal the leads...marshal the leads?  What the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the leads.  What the fuck talk is that? What the fuck talk is that?  Where did you learn that?  In school?  That's "talk," my friend, that's "talk." Our job is to sell.  I'm the man to sell.  I'm getting garbage.  You're giving it to me, and what I'm saying is it's fucked.
L243868 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ I have.  And my job is to marshal those leads...
L243867 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ ...you talk to Murray...
L243866 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Murray...
L243865 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass.  I need the leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you.
L243864 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ ...after the thirtieth...
L243863 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ ...it isn't you...?  Who is it? Who is this I'm talking to?  I need the leads...
L243862 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ It isn't me...
L243861 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Lately kiss my ass lately.  That isn't how you build an org...talk, talk to Murray.  Talk to Mitch. When we were on Peterson, who paid for his fucking car?  You talk to him.  The Seville...?  He came in, "You bought that for me Shelly." Out of what?  Cold calling.  Nothing. Sixty-five, when we were there, with Glen Ross Farms?  You call 'em downtown.  What was that?  Luck? That was "luck"?  Bullshit, John. You're burning my ass, I can't get a fucking lead...you think that was luck.  My stats for those years? Bullshit...over that period of time...?  Bullshit.  It wasn't luck. It was skill.  You want to throw that away, John...?  You want to throw that away?
L243860 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Not lately it isn't.
L243859 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Bullshit.  John.  Bullshit.  April, September 1981.  It's me.  It isn't fucking Moss.  Due respect, he's an order taker, John.  He talks, he talks a good game, look at the board, and it's me, John, it's me...
L243858 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Moss.
L243857 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Under him?
L243856 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Roma.
L243855 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ What is this "you say"?  A deal kicks out...I got to eat.  Shit, Williamson, shit.  You...Moss... Roma...look at the sheets...look at the sheets.  Nineteen eighty, eighty-one...eighty-two...six months of eighty-two...who's there? Who's up there?
L243854 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ All that I'm saying...
L243853 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ ...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?
L243852 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ ...I only...
L243851 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ ...then...
L243850 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ ...no...
L243849 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ ...do you want to go downtown...?
L243848 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ ...no...
L243847 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ ...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
L243846 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
L243845 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ What two?
L243844 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ What about the other two?
