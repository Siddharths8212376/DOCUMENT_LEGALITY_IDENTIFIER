L536541 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.
L536537 +++$+++ u2971 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ ANIJ +++$+++ It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
L536536 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
L537134 +++$+++ u2972 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ ARTIM +++$+++ Bye.
L537133 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ I have to go home now.
L536968 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
L536967 +++$+++ u2972 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ ARTIM +++$+++ No... I want to stay with you...
L536966 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Tournel will take you the rest of the way...
L536965 +++$+++ u2972 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ ARTIM +++$+++ Anij!
L536855 +++$+++ u2972 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ ARTIM +++$+++ If you want to know 'what it's like to be a child', you need to learn how to play...
L536854 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ No one's ever asked me that before.
L536853 +++$+++ u2972 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ ARTIM +++$+++ Why not...?
L536852 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Androids... don't have...fun.
L536851 +++$+++ u2972 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ ARTIM +++$+++ Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
L536850 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...
L536849 +++$+++ u2972 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ ARTIM +++$+++ Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
L536848 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ For what purpose?
L536847 +++$+++ u2972 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ ARTIM +++$+++ Chase me!
L536844 +++$+++ u2972 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ ARTIM +++$+++ No, I mean...
L536843 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
L536842 +++$+++ u2972 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ ARTIM +++$+++ Do machines ever play?
L536841 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
L536840 +++$+++ u2972 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ ARTIM +++$+++ But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like...
L536839 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ My legs are eighty-seven-point- two centimeters. They were eighty-seven-point-two centimeters the day I was created. They will be eighty- seven-point-two centimeters the day I go off line. My operation depends on specifications that do not change.  I... cannot imagine... the experience of growing up or even tripping over my own feet...
L536838 +++$+++ u2972 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ ARTIM +++$+++ Sometimes I do.
L536837 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
L536836 +++$+++ u2972 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ ARTIM +++$+++ For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
L536835 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Really.
L536834 +++$+++ u2972 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ ARTIM +++$+++ Really?
L536833 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child...
L536832 +++$+++ u2972 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ ARTIM +++$+++ I can't imagine what it would be like to be a machine.
L536831 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
L536830 +++$+++ u2972 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ ARTIM +++$+++ Don't you ever get tired?
L536829 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Perhaps, that is true.
L536828 +++$+++ u2972 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ ARTIM +++$+++ I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
L536827 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ I aspire to be more than I am.
L536826 +++$+++ u2972 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ ARTIM +++$+++ Not everyone here agrees with him. I mean, you know, about machines. There was even a big fight about it once.  Do you like being a machine?
L536825 +++$+++ u2972 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ ARTIM +++$+++ I don't.
L536824 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ I understand.
L536823 +++$+++ u2972 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ ARTIM +++$+++ My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.
L536612 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ I am better.
L536611 +++$+++ u2972 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ ARTIM +++$+++ You're what?
L536610 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
L536701 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ If not for Data, you'd probably have been re-located by now.
L536700 +++$+++ u2972 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ ARTIM +++$+++ The artificial lifeform was right?
L536699 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum.  And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.
L536639 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ No.
L536638 +++$+++ u2972 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ ARTIM +++$+++ Won't he rust?
L536637 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Data doesn't breathe.
L536636 +++$+++ u2972 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ ARTIM +++$+++ Can he breathe under water?
L536684 +++$+++ u2981 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD'S COM VOICE +++$+++ Very good, Doctor. Picard out.
L536683 +++$+++ u2973 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ CRUSHER +++$+++ Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.
L536682 +++$+++ u2981 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD'S COM VOICE +++$+++ Are they in any danger?
L536681 +++$+++ u2973 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ CRUSHER +++$+++ They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
L536680 +++$+++ u2981 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD'S COM VOICE +++$+++ And our people?
L536679 +++$+++ u2973 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ CRUSHER +++$+++ Captain, the Son'a hostages declined to be examined. I had them confined to quarters.
L536988 +++$+++ u2973 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ CRUSHER +++$+++ Safer than leaving her here.
L536987 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Is it safe to move her?
L536986 +++$+++ u2973 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ CRUSHER +++$+++ She's stabilizing.
L536956 +++$+++ u2973 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ CRUSHER +++$+++ Yes. But look at this medscan...
L536955 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Will he live?
L536535 +++$+++ u2973 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ CRUSHER +++$+++ They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
L536534 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
L536349 +++$+++ u2973 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ CRUSHER +++$+++ Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...
L536348 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Very funny...
L536328 +++$+++ u2973 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ CRUSHER +++$+++ Sure it is. And your hair is still chestnut brown.
L536327 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ 'Yew-cheen chef-faw'... My collar size is exactly the same as it was at the Academy.
L536326 +++$+++ u2973 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ CRUSHER +++$+++ You either need a new uniform or a new neck.
L536934 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ I believe it is safe, sir.
L536933 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Will the structure hold if we blast through?
L536932 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ I'm showing fresh air  behind this calcite formation, Captain...
L536927 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Another forty-three people reported taken, sir...
L536926 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ How many?
L536801 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
L536800 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...
L536659 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ I don't know.
L536658 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
L536655 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
L536654 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ ... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
L536651 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...
L536650 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Incomplete, I might add.
L536645 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ 'Just a few loose ends to tie up.'
L536644 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
L536643 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ A ship,
L536634 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ How about a passive radiation scan?
L536633 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills...
L536617 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ And I do not believe I made a very good first impression.
L536616 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
L536615 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ ... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
L536614 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
L536613 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ I believe the boy is... afraid... of me.
L536601 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ I was in an isolation suit collecting physiometric data on Ba'ku children. My last memory is going into the hills, following a boy...
L536600 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ From the mission...
L536599 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ 'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
L536598 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ What's the last thing you remember, Data...
L536597 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Yes... that looks like them.
L536594 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ You're aboard the Enterprise.
L536593 +++$+++ u2974 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Captain, Geordi...?
L536592 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Hello, Data...
L537013 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ If you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated, the Federation will pursue you until...
L537012 +++$+++ u2984 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ RU'AFO +++$+++ I do not take orders from you.
L537011 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ It is over.
L537010 +++$+++ u2984 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ RU'AFO +++$+++ It is not over.
L537009 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over...
L536999 +++$+++ u2984 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ RU'AFO +++$+++ In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.
L536998 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ You're not going to launch anything until...
L536820 +++$+++ u2984 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ RU'AFO +++$+++ Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
L536819 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ I'll order Riker to turn around.
L536816 +++$+++ u2984 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ RU'AFO +++$+++ Federation support, Federation procedures, Federation rules... look in the mirror, Admiral... the Federation is old... in the last twenty four months, it's been challenged by every major power in the quadrant -- the Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion... they all smell the scent of death on the Federation. That's why you've embraced our offer... because it will give your dear Federation new life. Well, how badly do you want it, Admiral? Because there are hard choices to be made now. If the Enterprise gets through with news about their brave Captain's valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless Ba'ku, your Federation politicians will waver, your Federation opinion polls will open a public debate, your Federation allies will want their say... need I go on?
L536815 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...
L536814 +++$+++ u2984 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ RU'AFO +++$+++ Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
L536813 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.
L536467 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
L536466 +++$+++ u2984 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ RU'AFO +++$+++ It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.
L536464 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc... but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet...
L536463 +++$+++ u2984 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ RU'AFO +++$+++ Your android has turned dangerously violent, Captain... Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be destroyed.
L536392 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...
L536391 +++$+++ u2984 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ RU'AFO +++$+++ Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...
L536390 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ Another time.
L536389 +++$+++ u2984 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ RU'AFO +++$+++ Take us into a high orbit.  Lie down, Admiral. The girls will take twenty years off your face...
L536387 +++$+++ u2984 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ RU'AFO +++$+++ Planet's population. Six hundred people. You want to avoid unnecessary risks? Next time leave your android home.
L536386 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
L536385 +++$+++ u2984 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ RU'AFO +++$+++ Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...
L536996 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ There's nothing further to be gained from this...
L536995 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
L536992 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it.
L536991 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.
L536764 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ How many people would it take... before it becomes wrong? A thousand? Fifty thousand. A million?
L536763 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc.
L536762 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ We are betraying the principles upon which the Federation was founded... this is an attack on the very soul of the Federation.  This will destroy the Ba'ku. Just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history.
L536761 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ The Ba'ku.
L536760 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?
L536759 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
L536758 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
L536757 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.
L536756 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.
L536755 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
L536754 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
L536753 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
L536752 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
L536751 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.
L536750 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.
L536749 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ A planet in Federation space...
L536748 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...
L536747 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
L536746 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
L536745 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
L536744 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
L536743 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ ... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
L536742 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
L536741 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
L536740 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested.
L536557 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.
L536556 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ You're not finished here?
L536555 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
L536554 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
L536553 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
L536552 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ ... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal...
L536471 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ Good luck. Dougherty out.
L536470 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Understood.
L536469 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ All right. You have twelve hours, Captain. Then I want you out of The Briar Patch. In the meantime, we'll be heading out to the perimeter to call for Son'a reinforcements in case you fail.
L536462 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Sir, Commander Worf and I have been working on several tactical plans to safely...
L536461 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
L536460 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
L536459 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ Captain, I wasn't expecting you.
L536376 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out.
L536375 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ What kind of concerns?
L536374 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
L536373 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
L536372 +++$+++ u2975 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ DOUGHERTY +++$+++ ... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
L536371 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
L537095 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Scan for lifesigns.
L537094 +++$+++ u2976 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ GALLATIN +++$+++ The countdown control has been transferred to the collector...I can't override...
L537039 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ What if he doesn't realize something's happening...  Can you get me to a transmitter? I have to speak with Worf and Data on the surface... we'll need their help...
L537038 +++$+++ u2976 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ GALLATIN +++$+++ It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
L537037 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ If we could lure him away from the bridge...
L537036 +++$+++ u2976 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ GALLATIN +++$+++ But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
L537035 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Do you know how to disable the injector?
L537034 +++$+++ u2976 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ GALLATIN +++$+++ What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
L537032 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ I'm not begging for my life. I'm begging for yours.  There is still a way home, Gal'na.
L537031 +++$+++ u2976 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ GALLATIN +++$+++ Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
L537030 +++$+++ u2980 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
L537023 +++$+++ u2984 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ RU'AFO +++$+++ Thank-you for reminding me.
L537022 +++$+++ u2976 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ GALLATIN +++$+++ The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
L537021 +++$+++ u2984 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ RU'AFO +++$+++ Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them...
L537020 +++$+++ u2984 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ RU'AFO +++$+++ No one hated them more than you, Gal'na.  We've come a long way together. This is the moment we've planned for so many years...
L537019 +++$+++ u2976 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ GALLATIN +++$+++ Moving them is one thing. Killing them all...
L537018 +++$+++ u2984 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ RU'AFO +++$+++ Deploy the collector.
L537017 +++$+++ u2976 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ GALLATIN +++$+++ May I talk to you alone?
L537016 +++$+++ u2984 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ RU'AFO +++$+++ Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders?
L536818 +++$+++ u2984 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ RU'AFO +++$+++ We'd have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don't have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation...
L536817 +++$+++ u2976 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ GALLATIN +++$+++ There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.
L536812 +++$+++ u2984 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ RU'AFO +++$+++ Recommendations?
L536811 +++$+++ u2976 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ GALLATIN +++$+++ They're following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters...
L536791 +++$+++ u2984 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ RU'AFO +++$+++ We're not waiting until morning... take the shuttles and get everyone off the surface tonight.
L536790 +++$+++ u2976 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ GALLATIN +++$+++ Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
L536789 +++$+++ u2984 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ RU'AFO +++$+++ The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
L536771 +++$+++ u2984 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ RU'AFO +++$+++ I'm sure. Just don't forget what they did to us.  We'll have them rounded up in a day or two... we needn't bother with the Federation holo-ship any more. Just get the holding cells ready.
L536770 +++$+++ u2976 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ GALLATIN +++$+++ No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
L536769 +++$+++ u2984 +++$+++ m195 +++$+++ RU'AFO +++$+++ Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?
