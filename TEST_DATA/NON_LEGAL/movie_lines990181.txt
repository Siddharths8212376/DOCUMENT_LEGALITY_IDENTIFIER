L431695 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ I wish I knew.
L431694 +++$+++ u6961 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
L431693 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.
L431690 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ He was always a good kid. You know that.
L431689 +++$+++ u6961 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the— er— as you put it— main order of business?
L431688 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
L431687 +++$+++ u6961 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ After what we been hearing about your brother, I thought your throat'd be kind of dry.
L431686 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ I'm not thirsty.
L431685 +++$+++ u6961 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Drink up, Charley. We're ahead of you.
L431112 +++$+++ u6961 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Why should he forget it?
L431111 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ You got a real friend here, kid. Don't forget it.
L431104 +++$+++ u6961 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Gimme.
L431103 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ I make it twentysix twenty-three. You're fifty short, Skins.
L431100 +++$+++ u6961 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ So look, kid, you don't think we c'n afford to be boxed out of a deal like this— a deal I sweated and bled for— on account of one lousy little cheese-eater, that Doyle bum, who thought he c'd go squealin' to the Crime Commission? Do you?—
L431099 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ It'll do.
L431098 +++$+++ u6961 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ We ain't robbin' pennies from beggars. We cuttin' ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a dozen piers—  a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor.  But a mighty sweet little drop, eh, Charley?
L431097 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.
L431096 +++$+++ u6961 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local— that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady— well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out— we take our cut.
L431095 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
L431092 +++$+++ u6961 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Listen kid, I'm a soft tough too. Ask any rummy  on the dock if I'm not good for a fin any time they put the arm on me.  But my old lady raised us ten kids on a stinkin' watchman's pension. When I was sixteen I had to beg for work in the hold. I didn't work my way up out of there for nuthin'.
L431091 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that— he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
L431090 +++$+++ u6961 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.
L431759 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ Okay— I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but— go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in.
L431758 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ It was you, Charley... .
L431757 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ You don't understand! I could've been a contender. I could've had class and been somebody. Real class. Instead of a bum, let's face it, which is what I am. It was you, Charley.
L431756 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
L431755 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ See! You don't understand!
L431754 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
L431753 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ It wasn't him!  It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says, "Kid, this ain't your night— we're going for the price on Wilson." It ain't my night. I'd of taken Wilson apart that night! I was ready— remember the early rounds throwing them combinations. So what happens— This bum Wilson he gets the title shot— outdoors in the ballpark! – and what do I get— a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to Palookaville.  It was you, Charley. You was my brother. You should of looked out for me. Instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money.
L431752 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.
L431751 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ ...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
L431750 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ What do you weigh these days, slugger?
L431749 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Wow... .
L431748 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ I wish I didn't have to do this, Terry.
L431747 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .
L431746 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ Take the boss loading, kid. For God's sake. I don't want to hurt you.
L431744 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Four thirty-seven— that isn't where Gerry G...?
L431743 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
L431742 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!
L431741 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ The point is— there isn't much time, kid.
L431740 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I could have been better!
L431739 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ What the hell!!!
L431738 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Don't say that!
L431737 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ —ex-tanker who's walking on his heels— ?
L431736 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Don't say that!
L431735 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped—
L431734 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I know. I know.
L431733 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals— you know what they're worth to us?
L431732 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I don't know— I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
L431731 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against— 
L431730 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Yeah— yeah— I guess I do— but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
L431729 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?
L431728 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
L431727 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
L431726 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Boss loader!
L431725 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ There's a slot for a boss loader on the new pier we're opening up.
L431724 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ Maybe.
L431723 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I always figured I'd live longer without it.
L431722 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
L431721 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
L431720 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
L431719 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Mm—hmmm.
L431718 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
L431717 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Mm—hmm.
L431716 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater.
L431715 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ That's right... .
L431714 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
L431713 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
L431712 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
L431711 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden.
L431708 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ Thicker than water.
L431707 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Gee, Charley, I'm sure glad you stopped by for me. I needed to talk to you. What's it they say about blood, it's— 
L431539 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Nolan? I knew he had guts but—
L431538 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.
L431258 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ Let me explain you something, kid. Stooling is when you rat on your friends, on the guys you're with.  When Johnny needs a favor, don't try to figure it out, just do it. Now go ahead, join the congregation.
L431257 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
L431256 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
L431255 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.
L431254 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.
L431253 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
L431252 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
L431251 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ It's a living.
L431250 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ Working hard?
L431026 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ In a minute.
L431025 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.
L431017 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ He probably gave 'em an argument.
L431016 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
L431015 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ Maybe he gave them an argument.
L431014 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I thought they'd talk to him. Try to get him to dummy up.
L431013 +++$+++ u6951 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ That was the idea.
L431012 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ You said they was only going to talk to him.
L431982 +++$+++ u6954 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ FATHER BARRY +++$+++ You hear that, Terry?  Terry, did you hear that?  You lost the battle but you have a chance to win the war. All you gotta do is walk.
L431981 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ They're waiting for him to walk in.
L431970 +++$+++ u6954 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ FATHER BARRY +++$+++ Terry... Terry... .
L431969 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Terry...?
L431964 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Tommy, what happened?
L431963 +++$+++ u6954 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ FATHER BARRY +++$+++ What happened?  What happened?
L431189 +++$+++ u6954 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ FATHER BARRY +++$+++ You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
L431188 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
L431187 +++$+++ u6954 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ FATHER BARRY +++$+++ Hello, Edie.
L431186 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Father Barry.
L431052 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ "In the church when you need me." Was there ever a saint who hid in the Church?
L431051 +++$+++ u6954 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ FATHER BARRY +++$+++ Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.
L431050 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too— don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.
L431049 +++$+++ u6954 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ FATHER BARRY +++$+++ I wish I knew, Edie, But— 
L431048 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me— who?  -- who?
L431047 +++$+++ u6954 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ FATHER BARRY +++$+++ Why Edie, I—
L431046 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Time and faith... . My brother's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith.
L431988 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Terry...?
L431987 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Am I on my feet...?
L431930 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ You always said I was a bum. Well—  —not anymore. I'm going down to the dock. Don't worry, I'm not going to shoot anybody. I'm just going to get my rights.  Joey's jacket. It's time I start wearing it.
L431929 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Then go ahead— go ahead! Go down to the shape-up and get yourself killed, you stupid, pigheaded, son of a—  What are you trying to prove? With a decisive gesture Terry takes the hook and sticks it through his belt. Then he goes to the wall and lifts Joey's windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging. He puts the windbreaker on in a deliberate way, and grins at her as he does so; then he walks to the door with a sense of dignity he has never had before.
L431921 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Farm...
L431920 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland— the Middle West somewhere— a job on a farm... .
L431919 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Every one of 'em... .
L431918 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
L431917 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ My pigeons... .
L431916 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ He's going to have to grow up too.
L431915 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Jimmy...
L431909 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Are you sure they're your friends?
L431908 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ But I feel like— My friends won't talk to me.
L431907 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Well, it's over.
L431906 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Thanks just the same.
L431905 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ I thought you might want some hot coffee.
L431904 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Edie.
L431836 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ No, I can't let you. I can't, you're—
L431835 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Get out of my way.
L431834 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Terry, for God's sake.
L431833 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
L431832 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Terry, you're bleeding.
L431829 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.
L431828 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Terry, no, no... .
L431827 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I'll take it out of their skulls.
L431826 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
L431825 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I'll take it out of their skulls.
L431824 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ I mean it, let's get away from here, first Joey then Nolan, now Charley— and any minute... .  ...I'm frightened— I'm frightened.
L431823 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Charley.
L431815 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I'm looking for Charley. I heard Charley was waiting for me.  Charley?
L431814 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.
L431785 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Edie, Edie, I...
L431784 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
L431783 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
L431782 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Get away from me.
L431781 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Edie...
L431780 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
L431779 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ My hand.
L431778 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I keep hearing it and I don't know what to do..I don't know what to do... .
L431777 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
L431776 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ That—  —word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
L431775 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
L431774 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I know what you want me to do!
L431773 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
L431772 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I don't want to hurt Charley— I don't want to hurt you...
L431771 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.
L431770 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.
L431769 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
L431768 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?

L431500 +++$+++ u6953 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Why should I come hollering to you at all?
L431499 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
