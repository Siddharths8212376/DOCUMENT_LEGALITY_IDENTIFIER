L295636 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Yes, I need them very much. And if you ever say them I'll never let you take them back.
L295635 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You need the words?
L295634 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I love you.
L295633 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You know, someday, Sarah, you're gonna settle down. You're gonna marry a college professor, and you're gonna write a great book. Maybe about me, huh? Fast Eddie Felson, hustler.
L295632 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ You're not a loser, Eddie. You're a winner. Some men never get to feel that way about anything. I love you, Eddie.
L295631 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah.  Yeah. It bothers me a lot.  'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.
L295630 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Does it bother you? What he said?
L295629 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Well, what else does?
L295628 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Is that what makes a winner?
L295627 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Well, he owns things.
L295626 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Is he a winner?
L295625 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ He's a gambler.
L295624 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
L295623 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
L295622 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Why did he tell you?
L295621 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ He knows. A lot.
L295620 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Would he know?
L295619 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.
L295618 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ A loser?
L295617 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Sarah, do you think I'm a loser?
L295615 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What's it so hot in here for?
L295614 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ No. You?
L295613 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You wanna drink?
L295612 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?
L295608 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I got beat up. They...  They broke my thumbs.
L295607 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ What happened?
L295606 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Me. It's Eddie.
L295605 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Who is it?
L295479 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ That's right! And I'm sure you'll help me.
L295478 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You'll find yourself another rich old lover.
L295477 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ You told Charlie to lay down and die. Will you say that to me too?  What happens, Eddie?
L295474 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What's this supposed to mean: "We have a contract of depravity. All we have to do is pull the blinds down."
L295473 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Give it back to me.
L295472 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What's this supposed to mean?
L295471 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Give it to me.
L295470 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
L295469 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What are you writing?
L295465 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah. For a little while.
L295464 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ You going out?
L295418 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ No, stick around.  Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?
L295417 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Do you want me to go?
L295411 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ From a rich old man who used to be my lover.
L295410 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
L295409 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ No, why should I? It's yours.
L295408 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Haven't you opened it?
L295407 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Eddie, what's in that case?
L295406 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Oh, it's not bad.
L295405 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I've got something in my bag.
L295404 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Oh, cut my finger.
L295403 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Raw.
L295402 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Eggs. How do you like them?
L295401 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Don't you ever cook anything?
L295400 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
L295399 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
L295398 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ When you've got money, you'll pay.
L295397 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What did all this stuff cost you?
L295396 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
L295395 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I'm hungry.
L295394 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I'm getting treatments right here.
L295393 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.
L295392 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
L295391 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You got it all in your head?
L295390 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Mm hmm.
L295389 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What, are you kidding? See that book?  I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here. I haven't finished the first chapter.  Did you read all them books?
L295388 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ You want to go with me?
L295387 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Well, I believe you when you say you go to school.
L295386 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Museums... art galleries... concerts.
L295385 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
L295384 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Thanks.
L295383 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, "Listen, I got a fella."
L295381 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.
L295380 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?
L295379 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Oh, I forgot.
L295378 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ At school. It's Thursday.
L295377 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Where you been all day?
L295374 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Well, what do you want to know? And why?
L295373 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I'm not sure... I don't know.
L295372 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later...  Come here.
L295371 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Sarah.  Eddie, look. I've got troubles, and I think maybe you've got troubles. Maybe it'd be better if we just leave each other alone.
L295370 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Okay. So what's your name today?
L295369 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
L295368 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You told me.
L295367 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ How did you know my name was Sarah?
L295366 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What did you say that for, Sarah?
L295365 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Oh, you need a shave. You mustn't go looking like that. There's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. Compliments of the house.
L295364 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Come here.
L295363 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Why?
L295362 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
L295361 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ What time is it?
L295360 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Give me a drag.
L295359 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ A day like any other. People come, people go.
L295358 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
L295357 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Why did you do that?
L295334 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ No. I'll take you home.
L295333 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
L295332 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Fifth of scotch?
L295331 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ No.
L295330 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I could always get us a bottle.
L295329 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
L295328 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
L295327 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
L295326 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Eddie. The name is Eddie.
L295325 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?
L295324 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Hey!
L295323 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I drink.
L295322 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What do you do on the other days?
L295321 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
L295320 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ So why go to college?
L295319 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I'm not.
L295318 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.
L295317 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
L295316 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You don't look like a college girl.
L295315 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
L295314 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah? What do you do now?
L295313 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I used to be an actress.
L295312 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You talk kind of funny, but I like it.
L295309 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Sometimes I wake up and I can't sleep, not without a drink. The bars don't open until eight. Mack over there has faith in me. When I'm broke, he trusts me. Don't you trust me, Mack?
L295308 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ No, not always.
L295307 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Do you always ask so many questions?
L295306 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
L295305 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
L295304 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Around.
L295303 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?
L295302 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Then why go to the bus station?
L295301 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I wasn't waiting for a bus.
L295300 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ How come you didn't catch your bus?
L295299 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ It's the lights. And the scotch.
L295295 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Can I buy you another drink?
L295294 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
L295293 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
L295292 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
L295291 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Can I sit down?
L295290 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Fair.
L295289 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Have a nice trip?
L295282 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Thanks. I will.
L295281 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Have a nice trip.
L295279 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
L295278 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
L295277 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Eight o'clock.
L295276 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yours.
L295275 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ What bus?
L295274 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What time does the bus leave?
L295273 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Fine, thanks.
L295272 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Just a cup of black coffee, please...  Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute!  Would you, uh, like another cup?
L295271 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Since four.
L295270 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ How long have you been waiting?
L295269 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ What?
L295268 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ How long you been waiting?
L295267 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Yes.
L295266 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Long wait for a bus?
L295968 +++$+++ u1417 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FATS +++$+++ So do you, Fast Eddie.

L295936 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I'm shootin' pool, Fats. When I miss you can shoot.
L295935 +++$+++ u1417 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FATS +++$+++ Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.

L295926 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's savings.  What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland.
L295925 +++$+++ u1417 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FATS +++$+++ Thousand dollars a game.
L295924 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You name it.
L295923 +++$+++ u1417 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FATS +++$+++ That's good, Eddie. For how much?
L295922 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I came to play pool, Fats.
L295259 +++$+++ u1417 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FATS +++$+++ You watch me.
L295258 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
L295257 +++$+++ u1417 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FATS +++$+++ Game's over, Eddie.
L295256 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.

L295203 +++$+++ u1417 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FATS +++$+++ Preach! Go down and get me some White Tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice.
L295196 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You know I gotta hunch, fat man. I gotta hunch it's me from here on in... One ball, corner pocket.  I mean, that ever happen to you? When all of a sudden you feel like you can't miss? I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about this game every night on the road... five ball...  You know, this is my table, man. I own it.
L295195 +++$+++ u1417 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FATS +++$+++ Very good shot.
L295194 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.
L295193 +++$+++ u1417 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FATS +++$+++ That's what the game's all about.
L295192 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You miss?  Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
L295191 +++$+++ u1417 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FATS +++$+++ Your shot.
L295181 +++$+++ u1417 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FATS +++$+++ Nine ball.  Three ball.
L295180 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ And them fingers, them chubby fingers. And that stroke. It's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something.
