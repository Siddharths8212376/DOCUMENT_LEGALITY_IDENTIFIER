L231204 +++$+++ u5467 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ GANDHI +++$+++ Not true!  The secret is mastering the urge.
L231203 +++$+++ u5473 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ PATEL +++$+++ It must have been the only Non-violent campaign ever led by a man who wanted to kill everybody every day.
L231076 +++$+++ u5473 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ PATEL +++$+++ Well, I've called you here because I've had a chance to see the new legislation. It's exactly what was rumored. Arrest without warrant. Automatic imprisonment for possession of materials considered seditious...
L231075 +++$+++ u5467 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ GANDHI +++$+++ I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru.
L230878 +++$+++ u5467 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ GANDHI +++$+++ No.
L230877 +++$+++ u5473 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ PATEL +++$+++ Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
L230876 +++$+++ u5467 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ GANDHI +++$+++ I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
L230875 +++$+++ u5473 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ PATEL +++$+++ I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.
L230874 +++$+++ u5473 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ PATEL +++$+++ That's young Nehru. He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! Wave! -- he may amount to something.
L230873 +++$+++ u5467 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ GANDHI +++$+++ Who is that young man?
L230819 +++$+++ u5470 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ KHAN +++$+++ Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
L230818 +++$+++ u5467 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ GANDHI +++$+++ If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
L230817 +++$+++ u5470 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ KHAN +++$+++ Well, that's one victory.
L230816 +++$+++ u5467 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ GANDHI +++$+++ It's split the Government.
L230815 +++$+++ u5470 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ KHAN +++$+++ The fools!  Sorry...
L230814 +++$+++ u5467 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ GANDHI +++$+++ My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
L230813 +++$+++ u5470 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ KHAN +++$+++ I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
L230811 +++$+++ u5467 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ GANDHI +++$+++ So did I.
L230810 +++$+++ u5470 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ KHAN +++$+++ No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.
L230809 +++$+++ u5467 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ GANDHI +++$+++ They're sparing no one, I see.
L230643 +++$+++ u5467 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ GANDHI +++$+++ I -- I will write to the press -- here -- and in England.  And I will use the courts.
L230642 +++$+++ u5470 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ KHAN +++$+++ Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
L230641 +++$+++ u5467 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ GANDHI +++$+++ Well, then, it must be fought. We are children of God like everyone else.
L230640 +++$+++ u5470 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ KHAN +++$+++ I can. But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less "holy" than Mr. Baker.
L230639 +++$+++ u5467 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ GANDHI +++$+++ You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him?
L230634 +++$+++ u5470 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ KHAN +++$+++ That was England.
L230633 +++$+++ u5467 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ GANDHI +++$+++ In England, I was a poor student but I --
L230845 +++$+++ u5476 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ SMUTS +++$+++ Oh!  Neither have I.  I'm awfully sorry.
L230844 +++$+++ u5467 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ GANDHI +++$+++ I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
L230843 +++$+++ u5476 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ SMUTS +++$+++ All right. Fine.
L230842 +++$+++ u5467 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ GANDHI +++$+++ Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
L230841 +++$+++ u5476 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ SMUTS +++$+++ Assuming we are in agreement?
L230839 +++$+++ u5467 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ GANDHI +++$+++ I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment.
L230838 +++$+++ u5476 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ SMUTS +++$+++ You're an extraordinary man.
L230835 +++$+++ u5467 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ GANDHI +++$+++ I congratulate them.
L230834 +++$+++ u5476 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ SMUTS +++$+++ Good. Good.  I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to "investigate" the new legislation.  I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed.
L230833 +++$+++ u5467 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ GANDHI +++$+++ Very well.
L230832 +++$+++ u5476 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ SMUTS +++$+++ I'm glad to hear you say that... very glad. You see if we repeal the Act under pressure  under this kind of pressure it will create a great deal of resentment. Can you understand that?
L230831 +++$+++ u5467 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ GANDHI +++$+++ Somehow I expected not.
L230830 +++$+++ u5476 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ SMUTS +++$+++ Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
L230829 +++$+++ u5467 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ GANDHI +++$+++ Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done.
L230828 +++$+++ u5476 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ SMUTS +++$+++ Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such "exception" to.
L230826 +++$+++ u5476 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ SMUTS +++$+++ Ahh.
L230825 +++$+++ u5467 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ GANDHI +++$+++ I dined at the prison.
L230824 +++$+++ u5476 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ SMUTS +++$+++ Perhaps some tea?
L230823 +++$+++ u5467 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ GANDHI +++$+++ Thank you. No.
L230822 +++$+++ u5476 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ SMUTS +++$+++ Will you have a glass of sherry?
L231377 +++$+++ u5468 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ IRWIN +++$+++ Thank him for his letter, and put him in jail.
L231376 +++$+++ u5475 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ SENIOR POLICE OFFICER +++$+++ Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.
L231375 +++$+++ u5468 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ IRWIN +++$+++ He's addressed this letter directly to you, has he?
L231369 +++$+++ u5475 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ SENIOR POLICE OFFICER +++$+++ I don't know! Nehru, Patel, almost every Congress Official is in jail... and their wives and their children -- we've even arrested Nehru's mother.
L231368 +++$+++ u5468 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ IRWIN +++$+++ Who's leading them?
L231367 +++$+++ u5475 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ SENIOR POLICE OFFICER +++$+++ ...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest.  And it still goes on.
L231327 +++$+++ u5475 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ SENIOR POLICE OFFICER +++$+++ Yes, sir. The day he sets off everyone is supposed to raise the flag of "Free India." Then he walks some two hundred and forty miles to the sea and makes salt.
L231326 +++$+++ u5468 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ IRWIN +++$+++ And that's the basis of this "Declaration of Independence"?
L231489 +++$+++ u5472 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ NEHRU +++$+++ Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
L231488 +++$+++ u5473 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ PATEL +++$+++ Could we cut all news off? I know --
L231485 +++$+++ u5473 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ PATEL +++$+++ ...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.
L231484 +++$+++ u5472 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ NEHRU +++$+++ In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.
L231480 +++$+++ u5473 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ PATEL +++$+++ Have you found him?
L231479 +++$+++ u5472 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ NEHRU +++$+++ He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.
L231468 +++$+++ u5473 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ PATEL +++$+++ If you did this, no one could control it. No one.
L231467 +++$+++ u5472 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ NEHRU +++$+++ Bapu, for me, and the rest,  if that is what you want, we will accept it. But out there  already there is rioting because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away.
L230946 +++$+++ u5473 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ PATEL +++$+++ No -- but I think I'm going to.
L230945 +++$+++ u5472 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ NEHRU +++$+++ Have you read his magazine?
L230908 +++$+++ u5472 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ NEHRU +++$+++ He's "discovering" India.
L230907 +++$+++ u5473 +++$+++ m364 +++$+++ PATEL +++$+++ Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?
L232132 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Too late for that.  We're closer to the other side.
L232131 +++$+++ u5478 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ ANTON +++$+++ Vincent, where's the shore?  We're too far out. We have to go back!
L232130 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Now is your chance to find out.
L232129 +++$+++ u5478 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ ANTON +++$+++ How are you doing this, Vincent?  How have you done <i>any</i> of this?
L232119 +++$+++ u5478 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ ANTON +++$+++ I will prove it to you.  Come swim with me now, Vincent.  Now--tonight.
L232118 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Who are you trying to convince?
L232117 +++$+++ u5478 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ ANTON +++$+++ You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
L232116 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that possible?
L232115 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ God, even <i>you</i> want to tell me what I <i>can't</i> do. In case you hadn't noticed, Anton, I don't need rescuing.  But <i>you</i> did, once.
L232114 +++$+++ u5478 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ ANTON +++$+++ It's for the best.
L232113 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
L232112 +++$+++ u5478 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ ANTON +++$+++ It's over.
L232111 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ There are a few million miles to go yet.
L232110 +++$+++ u5478 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ ANTON +++$+++ Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
L232109 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ You almost sound like you believe that.
L231628 +++$+++ u5484 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ GENETICIST +++$+++ Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
L231627 +++$+++ u5479 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ ANTONIO +++$+++ I'm sorry, there's no way we can.
L231626 +++$+++ u5484 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ GENETICIST +++$+++ It would be five thousand more.
L231625 +++$+++ u5479 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ ANTONIO +++$+++ How much extra?
L231619 +++$+++ u5484 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ GENETICIST +++$+++ I have to warn you, Mr Luca, he's going to be at least a head taller than you. Prepare for a crick in the neck in sixteen years time.
L231618 +++$+++ u5479 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ ANTONIO +++$+++ I like football.
L231617 +++$+++ u5484 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ GENETICIST +++$+++ Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
L231616 +++$+++ u5479 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ ANTONIO +++$+++ Er, no...
L231615 +++$+++ u5484 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ GENETICIST +++$+++ Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
L231614 +++$+++ u5479 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ ANTONIO +++$+++ He's right, Maria.  That's right.
L231613 +++$+++ u5484 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ GENETICIST +++$+++ You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
L231612 +++$+++ u5479 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ ANTONIO +++$+++ We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance.
L232102 +++$+++ u5480 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ I'll take care of it.
L232101 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
L232100 +++$+++ u5480 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
L232099 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ I'll see what I can do.
L232098 +++$+++ u5480 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ I guess so.  Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
L232097 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ I guess I'm a slow learner.
L232096 +++$+++ u5480 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ No?  What's keeping you?
L232095 +++$+++ u5489 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ JEROME +++$+++ Not yet, I'm afraid.
L232094 +++$+++ u5480 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ So you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, Vincent.
L232092 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ Where did you get this?
L232091 +++$+++ u5481 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DETECTIVE HUGO +++$+++ It's not <i>exactly</i> him.
L232084 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ Luca could still be an accomplice.
L232083 +++$+++ u5481 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DETECTIVE HUGO +++$+++ We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night.  What more do you want?
L232038 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ So we have two choices.  Either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or...  ...he <i>is</i> here.  We test again.  You're right, Hugo, this was a desperate act.  Someone had a lot to lose that night--perhaps their place in line.  I'd like the profiles of everyone with an upcoming mission.
L232037 +++$+++ u5481 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DETECTIVE HUGO +++$+++ Positive saliva match.  The cup was definitely used since the original sweep.
L232021 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ We'll vacuum these streets if we have to.
L232020 +++$+++ u5481 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DETECTIVE HUGO +++$+++ Where do we start?
L232019 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ What are you waiting for?
L231967 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
L231966 +++$+++ u5481 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DETECTIVE HUGO +++$+++ From what budget?
L231965 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
L231964 +++$+++ u5481 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DETECTIVE HUGO +++$+++ We don't have the manpower.
L231963 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.
L231962 +++$+++ u5481 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DETECTIVE HUGO +++$+++ He's not here.  It's a blind alley.
L231961 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ Something's not right.
L231960 +++$+++ u5481 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DETECTIVE HUGO +++$+++ That's the last.
L231939 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ Blood.  From the vein.
L231938 +++$+++ u5481 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DETECTIVE HUGO +++$+++ You know their workforce.  Two-thirds at least fall into the category.  We'll be closing down their operation for days.  At least go with a fingertip sample or urine.
L231937 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ A man can change his face--but blood is forever. Sample every employee within the parameters I gave you.  Intravenous.
L231936 +++$+++ u5481 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DETECTIVE HUGO +++$+++ None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
L231935 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ Don't underestimate these imposters.
L231934 +++$+++ u5481 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DETECTIVE HUGO +++$+++ It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  You've seen their security system.  They know who works there.  Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
L231933 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.
L231932 +++$+++ u5481 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DETECTIVE HUGO +++$+++ It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.
L231931 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ Of course.  He's a "de-gene-erate".  He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
L231929 +++$+++ u5481 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DETECTIVE HUGO +++$+++ No.  But one or two "borrowed ladders" have shown up there in the past.
L231928 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
L231927 +++$+++ u5481 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DETECTIVE HUGO +++$+++ The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.
L231889 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ This is a murder investigation.  The public should be happy to co-operate, to get this disease off the streets.
L231888 +++$+++ u5481 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DETECTIVE HUGO +++$+++ We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
L231887 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.  Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier establishments.  Random car stops.
L231886 +++$+++ u5481 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DETECTIVE HUGO +++$+++ With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.
L231885 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that?
L231884 +++$+++ u5481 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DETECTIVE HUGO +++$+++ Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.
L231883 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ --There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
L231882 +++$+++ u5481 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DETECTIVE HUGO +++$+++ This <i>is</i> the most likely location--
L231881 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.
L231805 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and found.  All we have to do is locate the man who's minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself.
L231804 +++$+++ u5481 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DETECTIVE HUGO +++$+++ What a pity.
L231803 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ --I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
L231802 +++$+++ u5481 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DETECTIVE HUGO +++$+++ I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
L231801 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
L231800 +++$+++ u5481 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DETECTIVE HUGO +++$+++ Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.
L231798 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ No.  Not <i>likely</i>.
L231797 +++$+++ u5481 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DETECTIVE HUGO +++$+++ Even if this Vincent Luca <i>is</i> alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?
L231796 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.
L231795 +++$+++ u5481 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DETECTIVE HUGO +++$+++ According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.
L231794 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ --What <i>about</i> his profile?
L231793 +++$+++ u5481 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DETECTIVE HUGO +++$+++ With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--
L231792 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ No, <i>this</i> is your man.
L231791 +++$+++ u5481 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DETECTIVE HUGO +++$+++ I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not...  ...universally loved.  He was leading the cut-backs in the program.  You're looking at a room full of motives.
L231790 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ Grudges?
L231789 +++$+++ u5481 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DETECTIVE HUGO +++$+++ Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
L231788 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ A man's dead, Detective.
L231787 +++$+++ u5481 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DETECTIVE HUGO +++$+++ I don't understand why you were dragged out here, Sir.  It's hardly worth wasting your time--a no-nothing case like this.
L232049 +++$+++ u5482 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DIRECTOR JOSEF +++$+++ I will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission.  We're already counting backwards.
L232048 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ At least it's nothing contagious.
L232040 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ This time I will supervise each test personally.
L232039 +++$+++ u5482 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DIRECTOR JOSEF +++$+++ Twelve have a mission within the week.
L231973 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep.  If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.  I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective.  In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.
L231972 +++$+++ u5482 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DIRECTOR JOSEF +++$+++ Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
L231971 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
L231970 +++$+++ u5482 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DIRECTOR JOSEF +++$+++ One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
L231969 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ Thank you, no.
L231968 +++$+++ u5482 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DIRECTOR JOSEF +++$+++ Would you care to look--in the telescope?
L231821 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ This unaccountable specimen was found in the south wing corridor.
L231820 +++$+++ u5482 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DIRECTOR JOSEF +++$+++ What a relief.
L231819 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ We believe we have a suspect.
L231817 +++$+++ u5482 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DIRECTOR JOSEF +++$+++ We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around.
L231816 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ Surely you know what you have.
L231815 +++$+++ u5482 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ DIRECTOR JOSEF +++$+++ Often.
L231814 +++$+++ u5487 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ INVESTIGATOR +++$+++ How often do you test, Director?
L232127 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ You have more in common than you know.
L232126 +++$+++ u5488 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ What's wrong with him?
L232125 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are just the clothes.  He has to wear them. Something I could never do.
L232124 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes.
L232123 +++$+++ u5488 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
L232122 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
L232064 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ Again?
L232063 +++$+++ u5488 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ It's about the Director.
L232062 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your "friends"?
L232061 +++$+++ u5488 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ Good to see you're feeling better.
L232059 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ Hello, sweatheart.  Come on up.
L232058 +++$+++ u5488 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ IRENE +++$+++ Jerome--?
L232057 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ Hello.
L231685 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ At least you're honest.  Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it.
L231684 +++$+++ u5493 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ I don't know exactly, Jerome.
L231683 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ You're both going to a lot of trouble--  Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own.  I'm sure you're sincere...  ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself.  Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it.  My point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?
L231682 +++$+++ u5493 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ German.
L231681 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
L231680 +++$+++ u5493 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Suit yourself.
L231679 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
L231678 +++$+++ u5493 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ What's wrong with it?
L231677 +++$+++ u5483 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?
L231676 +++$+++ u5493 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ You okay, Jerome?
L231672 +++$+++ u5493 +++$+++ m365 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ He's too tall.
