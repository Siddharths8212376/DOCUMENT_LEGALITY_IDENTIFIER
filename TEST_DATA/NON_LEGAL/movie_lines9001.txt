L101709 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us?
L101695 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ "I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."
L101694 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ "Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"
L101688 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us?
L101687 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya?
L101681 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
L101680 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
L101665 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Okay. We're ready.
L101664 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ "We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
L101663 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ "What do we tell him about the guns and money?"
L101578 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
L101577 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?
L101562 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ If that was a girl I want ta see some papers. She had ta be just preoperative for Christ sakes.
L101561 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ He got beat up by a girl.
L101560 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Don't even do it, ya bastard.
L101559 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.
L101558 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Oh, Jesus.
L101547 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.
L101546 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
L101529 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Shut it. It's Ma.
L101528 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ No fuckin' hot water man. That...
L101511 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Two. One ta screw it in and one ta suck my cock.
L101510 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ How many?
L101509 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
L101508 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Aye.
L101507 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Hey Murphy?
L101487 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Aye.
L101486 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.
L101518 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
L101517 +++$+++ u595 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROZ +++$+++ Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
L101513 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
L101512 +++$+++ u595 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROZ +++$+++ I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!
L101505 +++$+++ u595 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROZ +++$+++ Do you know where that term comes from? In the early 1900's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb.
L101504 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Yeah?
L101503 +++$+++ u595 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROZ +++$+++ Rule of thumb?
L101502 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...
L101495 +++$+++ u585 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ CONNOR +++$+++ Okay then... let's get ya started.
L101494 +++$+++ u595 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROZ +++$+++ I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.
L101955 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends.
L101954 +++$+++ u587 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DOLLY +++$+++ How do you figure?
L101953 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ The shooter knew these guys, huh?
L101943 +++$+++ u587 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DOLLY +++$+++ That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
L101942 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories.
L101939 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ No. This guy is big time.  These two are street-walking scum.
L101938 +++$+++ u587 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DOLLY +++$+++ Maybe the three of them had something in common.
L101929 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here.
L101928 +++$+++ u587 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DOLLY +++$+++ Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?
L101927 +++$+++ u587 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DOLLY +++$+++ Three.
L101926 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Of course they were. How many?
L101925 +++$+++ u587 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DOLLY +++$+++ They were wearing masks.
L101924 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Can she I.D. them?
L101923 +++$+++ u587 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DOLLY +++$+++ She was in here when it went down.
L101825 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
L101824 +++$+++ u587 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DOLLY +++$+++ So, what do we do now?
L101813 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Fan-fuckin-tastic!
L101812 +++$+++ u587 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DOLLY +++$+++ Uh... two shooters!
L101811 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ And number three, Dolly.
L101804 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.
L101803 +++$+++ u587 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DOLLY +++$+++ Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.
L101998 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ Male or female, bitch?!!
L101997 +++$+++ u588 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ It was... It was...
L101996 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
L101995 +++$+++ u588 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Pee...Per...Man.
L101994 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 
L101993 +++$+++ u588 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ My, my...
L101992 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!
L101991 +++$+++ u588 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ You killed my... my...
L101990 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
L101989 +++$+++ u588 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ You... oh god, why?
L101988 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
L101987 +++$+++ u588 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Where's my cat?
L101986 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ What?
L101974 +++$+++ u588 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Rocco!
L101973 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!
L101961 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Fucking figures. Look, are you guys seeing the pattern here? We got big questions at both of these crime scenes, with no answers. WHY did they kill the guys in the other two booths? WHY did he do the bartender? It would seem unnecessary, even stupid.  God, I hate cold crime scenes! I'm fucking leaving now. And do me a favor, tell me when the next guy dies, cause these guys are not done yet.
L101960 +++$+++ u589 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
L101959 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
L101958 +++$+++ u589 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
L101957 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?
L101947 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Why was I not informed of this?
L101946 +++$+++ u589 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
L101945 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ What?
L101944 +++$+++ u589 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
L101937 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Those doors were down... which means this. They looked down in through the peep hole, saw these guys and opened the doors from the inside. Pop, pop, pop, right through the glass. Why?
L101936 +++$+++ u589 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ No way they could have seen it?
L101935 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's  little fireman time.
L101823 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ And is there an American, shit is there a man seated among us that hasn't thought about it many times, let's just put them all on an island, give them guns and let them kill each other. This is our wet dream come true. You can expect federal and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law, then bury it from here on out.
L101822 +++$+++ u589 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
L101821 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?
L101816 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Possible, but unlikely. The angles are too extreme. A guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gonna shoot straight ahead. He wouldn't cock out his elbows, makes no sense. Besides, you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds? No way. Had to be at least two.
L101815 +++$+++ u589 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ What about one guy with two guns?
L101814 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!
L101808 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Excellent! Number two. Greenly.
L101807 +++$+++ u589 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
L101806 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy.
L101799 +++$+++ u589 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ The Sicilians.
L101798 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ The Greeks. The Italians.
L101797 +++$+++ u589 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
L101796 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
L101795 +++$+++ u589 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ New hitman wants to leave his mark
L101794 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ And the pennies?
L101793 +++$+++ u589 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
L101792 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?
L101791 +++$+++ u589 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ The fat man.
L101790 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ The what man?
L101789 +++$+++ u589 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
L101788 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.
L101621 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Really want to know?
L101620 +++$+++ u589 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ So what are you thinkin' here?
L102122 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
L102121 +++$+++ u590 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ GREENLY +++$+++ What if it was just one guy with six guns?
L101951 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the scumbags in the quiet city of Boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police doing my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad car and get me over there. I want the crime scene photos and any witness statements. NOW!
L101950 +++$+++ u590 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ GREENLY +++$+++ A couple of peons for the mob and...
L101949 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Who were the victims?
L101948 +++$+++ u590 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ GREENLY +++$+++ They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
L101934 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ No way they could have seen it.
L101933 +++$+++ u590 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ GREENLY +++$+++ Witness?
L101932 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth. After she watches them whack him, she passes out.  Why the two extra victims?
L101810 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men  Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?!  They sure as fuck did!
L101809 +++$+++ u590 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ GREENLY +++$+++ Uh.  Shit, I, uh...
L101787 +++$+++ u590 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ GREENLY +++$+++ Shit! Shit!
L101786 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?
L101784 +++$+++ u590 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ GREENLY +++$+++ Eight.
L101783 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ How many bodies, Greenly?
L101782 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Respect is earned, Greenly, never given. Guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps from my table.
L101781 +++$+++ u590 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ GREENLY +++$+++ Why do you always disrespect me like that?
L101780 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?
L101600 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Sweet-n-low!
L101599 +++$+++ u590 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ GREENLY +++$+++ Chief, what the fuck is this?
L101598 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Twist of lemon!
L101597 +++$+++ u590 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ GREENLY +++$+++ Who the...
L101591 +++$+++ u590 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ GREENLY +++$+++ Detective Greenly. Who the fuck are you?
L101590 +++$+++ u596 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ SMECKER +++$+++ Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
L101589 +++$+++ u590 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ GREENLY +++$+++ That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.
L101574 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ We promise.
L101573 +++$+++ u591 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Promise me boys.
L101557 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does.

L102083 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Well, I'm sold.
L102082 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ Worst day of my life, man.
L102031 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin' to be professional, but no...
L102030 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.
L102023 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ Well, what'ya do?
L102022 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.
L102019 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ So let's kill the motherfucker. I mean, what are you guys... like that's your new thing right?
L102018 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ So?
L102017 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone I was as good as dead. He goes in there every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses.
L102015 +++$+++ u594 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ ROCCO +++$+++ Y'know it is, a bit.
L102014 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Liberating isn't it?
L102006 +++$+++ u592 +++$+++ m37 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ You sure you killed them?
