L490223 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ You fit a lot of descriptions.
L490222 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Got a warrant?
L490221 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.

L490219 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ Why?  You wanted for a crime, Ethan?
L490218 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You can forget that...  Wouldn't be legal anyway.
L490213 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Well, swear him out again!...I'll go with you.

L490206 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ Haven't seen you since the surrender.  Come to think of it, I didn't see you <U>at</U> the surrender.

L490946 +++$+++ u7531 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ JOINT action?

L490960 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Mose...try to remember!...You were in Scar's camp...
L490956 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
L490955 +++$+++ u7543 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MOSE +++$+++ Come f'r my rockin' chai'...ole Mose.

L490759 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Well, the reward still stands...
L490752 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You were born old...
L490751 +++$+++ u7543 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MOSE +++$+++ Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
L490750 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever.
L490382 +++$+++ u7543 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MOSE +++$+++ Ay-eh...That's jest what I tole Joe Powers...That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan?
L490381 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want to miss...It makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours...
L490363 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ SURE!...They <U>WERE</U> here...Now they're out there...an' waitin' to jump us!...
L490362 +++$+++ u7543 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MOSE +++$+++ Ay-eh...They was here...
L490542 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Ain't yours yet.
L490541 +++$+++ u7534 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ FUTTERMAN +++$+++ Don't forget to come back with my thousand dollars.
L490538 +++$+++ u7534 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ FUTTERMAN +++$+++ In that case you won't find her -- and I won't get my thousand dollars.
L490537 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ And maybe you lie...
L490536 +++$+++ u7534 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ FUTTERMAN +++$+++ Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
L490535 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Keep talking.
L490534 +++$+++ u7534 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ FUTTERMAN +++$+++ Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
L490533 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.
L490532 +++$+++ u7534 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ FUTTERMAN +++$+++ A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...
L490531 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Talk!
L490526 +++$+++ u7534 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ FUTTERMAN +++$+++ You got it with you?
L490525 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ That's what I said.
L490524 +++$+++ u7534 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ FUTTERMAN +++$+++ You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
L490523 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ How'd you come by this?
L490708 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ That'll be the day...  'As we developed the village'... Next time you develop a village, hit it where the fightin' men are... You won't get any headlines for killin' squaws.
L490707 +++$+++ u7535 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
L490706 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Are you sure they didn't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o' Yank bluebellies so scared they couldn't tell the difference between a Cheyenne and a Comanche?
L490703 +++$+++ u7535 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
L490702 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
L490698 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche...Chief Scar's bunch...
L490697 +++$+++ u7535 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L490696 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ <U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
L490695 +++$+++ u7535 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Sir -- we charged!..Gentlemen -- and I hope you will quote me -- I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp...
L490998 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
L490997 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
L490994 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ She's alive...Better she's alive and livin' with Comanches than her brains bashed out...
L490993 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
L490992 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...
L490991 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ It's what I'm countin' on.
L490990 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.
L490877 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ What's goin' on?
L490876 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ What's that got to do with us?
L490859 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ She's been with the bucks! She's nothin' now but a...
L490858 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ You can keep your will!  I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
L490857 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Not no more.
L490856 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ 'I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound mind and without any blood kin, do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to Martin Pauley...'  I don't want your property.... 'Sides, what do you mean no 'blood kin?' Debbie's your blood kin...
L490850 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ We won't be here...Come on!
L490849 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ They'll be back...
L490848 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Over there!
L490847 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Go on! Get out of here while you can...
L490830 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
L490829 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ How? She's even forgot her own language!
L490823 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I don't know...Somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality...
L490822 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Why didn't he make his move back there?
L490821 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ He's got to...All these years, run- nin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him...Now we caught up...It's him or us.
L490820 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ You figger Scar means to kill us?
L490796 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Not likely.
L490795 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Stay out here.
L490774 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Cicatriz is Mex for <U>Scar</U>...an' he has a white girl in his tepee...Be seein' you...
L490773 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Never heard of him...
L490772 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Suit yourself...While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here... The Comanch' medicine country ain't far...there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz.
L490770 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'...
L490769 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Lemme alone...
L490719 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I ain't sure...Where's that doll?
L490718 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ No...She's not...
L490678 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
L490677 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Well, you're a widower now...
L490667 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Ain't that too bad...If you feel that sorry for your kinfolk, I'm surprised you didn't take up with that squaw wife of yours...
L490666 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
L490665 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.
L490663 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ What's the sense in it!
L490662 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Nine...  Ten!
L490661 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Ethan, quit it!
L490653 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
L490652 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I think maybe we oughta...
L490651 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
L490650 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Think she means for us to follow?
L490649 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
L490648 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Beats me how she could get that pony out o' camp without neither of us hearin' a thing...
L490643 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Look!  Scar?...  Do you know where he went? And if he has a girl with him...a <U>white</U> girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo...
L490642 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You ask her!
L490638 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Look?
L490637 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya...
L490633 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Cut it out, will ya...
L490632 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
L490628 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ And have her whole family after our scalps for floutin' one o' their women?...No sir! Come on, Mrs. Pauley...
L490627 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
L490626 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
L490625 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ What?
L490624 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ <U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!
L490619 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Think it might be...?
L490618 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ What I heard back there was that a band o' hostile Nawyeckas came through this way less'n two weeks ago...
L490616 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Forget it...
L490615 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ But I just bought a good blanket.
L490614 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ When are you goin' to learn to keep your mouth shut! Come on. Let's get out of here.
L490613 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Scar?
L490612 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Let's go...I think I stumbled onto somethin'...
L490560 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Whatchu doin'?...
L490559 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ He just couldn't wait...
L490558 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Futterman?
L490554 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You all settled an' comfortable now?
L490553 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Oh...
L490552 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse...
L490551 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ What's that?
L490550 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Not so funny...if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means...
L490548 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight...
L490547 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Hey! What's the idea...?
