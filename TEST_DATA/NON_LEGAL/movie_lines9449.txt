L589929 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
L589928 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I just saw Gray.  What was he laughing at?
L589907 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Pulse?
L589906 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ She's unconscious.
L589904 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Wait, Doctor -- wait!  The child's fainting.
L589903 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Here is where you must watch closely, gentleman -- closely -- it is the very heart of the matter --
L589898 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Who would believe that?  And you know, someone else might recognize her.  She was as well known as the Castle Rock.
L589897 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ But, I didn't ask him to kill.
L589896 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Believe it or not.  It's best for you to pretend that you do.  After all, it was you who ordered this specimen, received it here, and paid for it.  That makes you a party to murder.
L589895 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I can't believe that.
L589894 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I don't know that -- neither do you.  This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --
L589893 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
L589892 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I wouldn't do that, Fettes.  I wouldn't report it.
L589891 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I am sure.  I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again.
L589890 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ We can't be sure of that.
L589889 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Gray killed her.
L589888 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Well --
L589884 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
L589883 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
L589862 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Now you run off and see that pretty Mrs. Marsh and explain to her.
L589861 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Yes, I suppose so.
L589860 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ You see, it is completely out of the question.
L589859 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
L589858 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
L589857 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ But you did promise.
L589856 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
L589855 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
L589854 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
L589853 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ It was about last night I wanted to talk to you -- about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
L589807 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ So she told me.  I'm a teacher -- not a practitioner.
L589806 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ She came again today.  She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate.  She feels you are her only hope.
L589805 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I remember her.
L589804 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
L589791 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I'm sorry for the woman, Fettes. But her son might be alive today had more doctors been given the opportunity to work on more human specimens.  As for me, Fettes, I let no man stop me when I know I'm right -- when I know that I need those lifeless subjects for my student's enlightenment and for my own knowledge.  And if you're a real man and want to be a good doctor, you'll see it as I see it.
L589790 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ But this woman -- and her son --
L589788 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.
L589787 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?
L589786 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I saw the woman whose son's body was delivered last night.
L589785 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
L589784 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I don't think I can go on, sir.
L589743 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
L589742 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
L589731 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Richardson is a fine student.  He's got a glib tongue, but you'll be a better doctor, Fettes.  Come along now --
L589730 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ But Richardson?
L589729 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Well? And are you not a good student?
L589728 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I thought only the best students were made assistants.
L589727 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
L589726 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --
L589725 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ You're made for a doctor, young man!
L589724 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane.
L589712 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Excuse me.
L589711 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Dr. MacFarlane --
L589698 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Come -- it's a chance to try out your bedside manner, Fettes.  Take a look at the child.
L589697 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ But, Doctor, I only wanted to speak to you --
L589696 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Come in, boy -- come in.
L589695 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --
L590143 +++$+++ u3179 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GEORGINA +++$+++ I wanted to see the white horse --
L590142 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ You'll not need that again, Georgina.
L590127 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.
L590126 +++$+++ u3179 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GEORGINA +++$+++ I thought this was a school day.
L589937 +++$+++ u3179 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GEORGINA +++$+++ I can't.
L589936 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Don't you want to find the white horse, Georgina?  You can't find him from a wheelchair.  You have to walk and run to find him.
L589846 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ But you'll have to stand great pain, Georgina.  Greater pain than you ever dreamed of in the worst time of your sickness.  Do you want it that much?
L589845 +++$+++ u3179 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GEORGINA +++$+++ I want it --
L589844 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Aye, but I still wonder how much.
L589842 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ One shouldn't get used to the wrong things, Georgina.  You want to walk and run and play.
L589841 +++$+++ u3179 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GEORGINA +++$+++ Of course -- I don't have friends. That's because I can't walk.  I try to make myself used to it.
L589840 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Maybe there's another reason. Maybe you haven't friends enough. Could that be it, Georgina?
L589839 +++$+++ u3179 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GEORGINA +++$+++ He was a nice horse.
L589838 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Why do you want the white horse to bid you "good-day"?
L589835 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ An old acquaintance, eh?
L589834 +++$+++ u3179 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GEORGINA +++$+++ The white horse.  The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.
L589833 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Hear him?
L589705 +++$+++ u3179 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GEORGINA +++$+++ Well --
L589704 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Why, yes.
L589703 +++$+++ u3179 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GEORGINA +++$+++ What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?
L589701 +++$+++ u3179 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GEORGINA +++$+++ You'll be a good doctor.  I know all about doctors.
L589700 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Not yet.
L589699 +++$+++ u3179 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GEORGINA +++$+++ Are you a doctor, too?
L589668 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ A student.  I'm studying under Dr. MacFarlane -- that is, I've been studying until today --
L589667 +++$+++ u3184 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MACBRIDE +++$+++ A doctor?
L589666 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I'm by way of being a medical myself.
L589665 +++$+++ u3184 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MACBRIDE +++$+++ They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
L589664 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Not much danger here, ma'am, I wouldn't think -- right here in the heart of Edinburgh.
L589662 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Your son, ma'am?  He must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so.
L589661 +++$+++ u3184 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MACBRIDE +++$+++ He'll not leave the grave -- not since Wednesday last when we buried the lad.
L590109 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ No -- a pride to know that I can force you to my will. I'm a small man -- a humble man -- and being poor, I've had to do much that I did not want to do. But so long as the great Dr. MacFarlane jumps at my whistle, that long am I a man -- and if I have not that, I have nothing. Then I am only a cabman and a grave-robber.
L590108 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ A pleasure to torment me?
L590107 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
L590106 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ But why, Gray? Why?
L590105 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ But then I wouldn't have the fun of having you come here and beg again, Toddy.
L590104 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Well then -- I beg you -- I beseech you --
L590102 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Beg -- beg of you! You crawling graveyard rat!
L590101 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
L590100 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I would make you rich.
L590099 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Would you bribe me to leave you be?
L590098 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ What I was going to say is this -- wouldn't you be more comfortable at Leith in a neat little house?
L590097 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ The Resurrection business? That may end sooner than you think. New laws may come.
L590096 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ I have other means of sustenance.
L590095 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ You're getting old, Gray, and it's a hard life driving a cab through these wet and windy streets of Edinburgh --
L590093 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Another little drop'll never do you any harm.
L590092 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I've drunk enough tonight.
L590091 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Have another glass of something good, Toddy.
L590090 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ We have never been friends.
L590089 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy.
L590086 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I can't understand your hurt to me -- but I must cut you out.
L590085 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
L590084 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Gray, I must rid myself of you -- you've become a cancer -- a malignant, evil cancer -- rotting my mind.
L590040 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ You are not to set foot in here again, Gray, for business or any other reason. And you're going out now!
L590039 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
L590038 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Get out of here!
L590037 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ This is a gift you'll not return.
L590036 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I take no gifts from you.
L590035 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ This is a gift.
L590034 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I've ordered nothing from you.
L590033 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ I brought you something tonight, MacFarlane -- an interesting specimen -- in very good condition.
L590030 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony, Meg?
L590029 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ What are you going here? Have I not told you --
L589984 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ I have no wish for a rope cravat. I've never liked the smell of hemp, so I'll bid you good night, Doctor MacFarlane.
L589983 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me.
L589982 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Aye, Toddy, there is something in what you say.
L589981 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ No, I'm not afraid. Tell! Shout it from the housetops!  And remember this -- they hanged Burke -- they mobbed Hare -- but Dr. Knox is living like a gentleman in London.
L589980 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
L589979 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me?
L589977 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Here, have another glass, MacFarlane. I'll take you home and we'll be friends again -- now that you know that you're Knox's man and my friend -- aye, forever.
L589976 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I am a doctor - a good doctor. I could make her walk, but she won't - she won't --
L589974 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ You don't know and you'll never know or understand, Toddy. Not from me or from Knox would you learn those things. Look --
L589973 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ In the brain, I tell you. I know.
L589972 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ But what makes a thought start?
L589971 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ The nerve centers -- the brain --
L589970 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
L589969 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ The heart pumps it.
L589968 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
L589967 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
L589966 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
L589965 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
L589964 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy.
L589962 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ The same. Look here, Gray --
L589961 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
L589960 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I set those blocks together, patched the muscles. I put the nerves where they should be -- I did it and I did it right -- and she won't walk --
L589959 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ I've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man.
L589958 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
L589957 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ I've had some experience.
L589956 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ You know something about the human body, Gray.
L589954 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More like the old days.
L589953 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me.
L589919 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray --  -- for auld lang syne.
L589918 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
L589917 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
L589916 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy.  Not at all friendly.
L589824 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Hear him?  Did you ever see the lads play knife?
L589823 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
L589822 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Toddy hates me.
L589820 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ That's a good boy, Toddy.
L589819 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ It might be an interesting case.
L589818 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Maybe there's some private reason between you and me which will make you -- some long lost friend of ours.  Say that you'll do it for me and my friend, Mr. Fettes, here.
L589817 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ No.
L589816 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
L589815 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I'll not do it, Gray.
L589814 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
L589813 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ You?  Why?  Since when have you become the protector of little children?
L589812 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Why don't you do it then?
L589811 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I am the best man for the job.
L589810 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
L589809 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Afraid of what?
L589808 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ You're a teacher, eh?  Maybe you're afraid to be a doctor, Toddy.
L589803 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ You will not have it?
L589802 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I will not have you use that name to me.
L589798 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.
L589797 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
L589796 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Well, then, Doctor MacFarlane -- although I've known a time, Toddy, when you liked the name.  Aye, and many are dead now who called you by it; rough and wild ones they were, too.  But come Toddy, sit down here with your young friend.
L589795 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Don't call me that confounded name.
L589794 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.
L590020 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they "Burked" them.
L590019 +++$+++ u3181 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
L590018 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ "Nor did they handle axe or knife To take away their victim's life -- No sooner done than in a chest They crammed their lately welcome guest."
L590017 +++$+++ u3181 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
L590016 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ "A good-day to you Madame Tosspot, and would you like a little glass of something before you take your rest? Come with me to my house and I'll make you my guest. You shall have quarts to drink if you like."  Ah, how he cozened them.
L590015 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ That was Hare's end. Ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!
L590014 +++$+++ u3181 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ But where did they get those people?
L590013 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Eighteen persons they killed and sold the bodies to Dr. Knox at ten pounds for a large and eight pounds for a small. That's good business, Joseph.
L590012 +++$+++ u3181 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ I never heard that song. But what did they do?
L590011 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ "The ruffian dogs, the Hellish pair.  The villain Burke, the meager Hare --"
L590010 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ But still you may have heard the peddlers of verse cry out their names on the streets.
L590009 +++$+++ u3181 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ I come from Lisbon.
L590008 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
L590007 +++$+++ u3181 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Burke them?
L590006 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
L590005 +++$+++ u3181 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
L590004 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ You and I should work together.
L590000 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.
L589999 +++$+++ u3181 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?
L589993 +++$+++ u3181 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Give me money or I'll tell the police you murder the "subjects."
L589992 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ You say you've come here on your own account?  No one knows you are here?
L589991 +++$+++ u3181 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ I know that you kill people to sell bodies.
L589990 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Only Brother.
L589989 +++$+++ u3181 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Can anyone hear what we say?
L589988 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Now that is very interesting --  Take a chair, Joseph,
L589987 +++$+++ u3181 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Yes.
L589986 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ You're welcome to my little nest, Joseph -- is it not? That's right -- you have something to say to  me -- something very private.
