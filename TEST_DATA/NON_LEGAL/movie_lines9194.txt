L329652 +++$+++ u1669 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VIJAY +++$+++ Hey man.
L329699 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ You think you're special because you get to play Picture Pages up there?
L329698 +++$+++ u1667 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ ULTRASOUND TECH +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L329697 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
L329696 +++$+++ u1667 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ ULTRASOUND TECH +++$+++ I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
L329695 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
L329694 +++$+++ u1667 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ ULTRASOUND TECH +++$+++ Excuse me?
L329693 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ What is your job title, exactly?
L329692 +++$+++ u1667 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ ULTRASOUND TECH +++$+++ No... I guess not.
L329691 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?
L329688 +++$+++ u1667 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ ULTRASOUND TECH +++$+++ I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.
L329687 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
L329679 +++$+++ u1667 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ ULTRASOUND TECH +++$+++ Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?
L329678 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ What? I'm not made of stone.
L329532 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You know it wasn't his idea.
L329531 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
L329530 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
L329529 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
L329528 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
L329527 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
L329526 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
L329525 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
L329497 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
L329496 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ Nails? Really?
L330119 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
L330118 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
L330117 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
L330116 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
L330115 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
L330114 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
L329817 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ Oh, go fly a kite.
L329816 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Wow, dream big!
L329815 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.
L329814 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ We don't even have a dog!
L329813 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ I know enough.
L329812 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ You don't know anything about me!
L329811 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
L329810 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
L329809 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
L329808 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.
L329807 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
L329806 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
L329805 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
L329804 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
L329803 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
L329518 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ The term "deliver" is so weird. Can we not say "deliver"?
L329517 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
L329516 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Cool it.
L329515 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
L329514 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ No.
L329510 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Well, I'm not ready to be a mom.
L329509 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
L329508 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ But they have a real lawyer and everything. I'm going to meet with them next weekend.
L329489 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people.
L329488 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ Oh, God...
L329482 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.
L329481 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
L329480 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ Hon, did you get expelled?
L329479 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I have no idea how to spit this out.
L329417 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.
L329416 +++$+++ u1656 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ BREN +++$+++ Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.
L329573 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Shit, yeah. Close it up.
L329572 +++$+++ u1657 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ GERTA +++$+++ Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
L329571 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid.
L329557 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks.
L329556 +++$+++ u1657 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ GERTA +++$+++ No, I mean in your pregnancy.
L329555 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I'm a junior.
L329554 +++$+++ u1657 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ GERTA +++$+++ So, Juno. First off, how far along are you?
L329398 +++$+++ u1659 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ GUY LAB PARTNER +++$+++ Good, I'll be sure to do that, Amanda. I'll make a note of it.
L329397 +++$+++ u1658 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ GIRL LAB PARTNER +++$+++ Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
L329396 +++$+++ u1659 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ GUY LAB PARTNER +++$+++ Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
L329393 +++$+++ u1658 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ GIRL LAB PARTNER +++$+++ Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes.
L329392 +++$+++ u1659 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ GUY LAB PARTNER +++$+++ What? My eyes are not lying!
L329391 +++$+++ u1658 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ GIRL LAB PARTNER +++$+++ Something happened. Because your eyes? Are very cold? They're very cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes.
L329390 +++$+++ u1659 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ GUY LAB PARTNER +++$+++ You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened!
L329389 +++$+++ u1658 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ GIRL LAB PARTNER +++$+++ No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
L329388 +++$+++ u1659 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ GUY LAB PARTNER +++$+++ Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.
L330015 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Not really. I'm sixteen. I'm old enough to tell when people are acting like total a-holes!
L330014 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ God, you're so young.
L330013 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Please don't get a divorce! God, Mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife.
L330011 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying.
L330010 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.
L330009 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?
L330008 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ This...  ...this is what my life has become. Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. Is that so appealing to you?
L330007 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
L330006 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
L330005 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ But you're old!
L330004 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
L330003 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
L330002 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ But I thought you'd be cool if...
L330001 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ This isn't what we agreed on. You guys have to take care of... this! You are the chosen custodians of the big-ass bump!
L330000 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ What's the matter?
L329999 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
L329998 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ No?
L329997 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ No.
L329996 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ It's just not working out, but I'm getting my own place in the city... and I've got it all planned out. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time...
L329995 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ What?
L329994 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I'm leaving Vanessa.
L329992 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I don't know.
L329991 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ What are you?
L329990 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Only squares and nerds go to dances.
L329989 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ You've never been to a dance, have you?
L329988 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Oh, okay. Like this.
L329986 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Oh man, I can just picture you slow dancing like a dork!
L329985 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
L329984 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
L329983 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.
L329982 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ You do?
L329981 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I actually know this one.
L329980 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ What?
L329977 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. You should be proud to be the same condition.
L329976 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now.
L329975 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.
L329974 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ "Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!
L329972 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ You're gonna like this, I promise.
L329971 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Oh God, you're one of those guys...
L329970 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
L329969 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
L329968 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Come on, I have something for you.
L329967 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Cool.
L329966 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Nope. We're safe.
L329965 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Is Vanessa here?
L329964 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Wow. That shirt is working hard.
L329912 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Go learn something.
L329911 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
L329910 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
L329909 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Consider it your musical education.
L329908 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
L329907 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
L329906 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Cute?
L329905 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
L329904 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Oh really? What's the verdict?
L329903 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ So, I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me.
L329902 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Hello?
L329799 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
L329798 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Cold feet.
L329794 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Why?
L329793 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
L329790 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
L329789 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
L329786 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
L329785 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
L329770 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
L329769 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
L329768 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Why? What the big deal?
L329767 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
L329766 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ You're something else.
L329765 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
L329764 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.
L329763 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Uh, thanks.
L329762 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ That suits you.
L329761 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
L329760 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
L329759 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
L329758 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
L329757 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
L329756 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Here's to dovetailing interests.
L329755 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark.
L329754 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Frankly, this looks kind of stupid.
L329753 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Argento's good, but Lewis is completely demented. We're talking buckets of goo. Red corn syrup everywhere. And fake brains up the yin-yang.
L329752 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror.
L329751 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
L329750 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ The Wizard of Gore?
L329749 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Yeah, I definitely need to make you some CDs. At least while my kid is hanging out in there.
L329748 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
L329747 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
L329746 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ You don't have to do that.
L329745 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
L329744 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Hey, I like this.
L329743 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
L329742 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Listen.
L329741 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
L329740 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.
L329739 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ What is it?
L329737 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.
L329736 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ We definitely want it to have junk.
L329735 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Yeah?
L329734 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I know what junk is.
L329733 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ You know... it's parts...
L329732 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Junk?
L329731 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
L329730 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Well, it can really only go two ways.
L329729 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
L329728 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
L329727 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ No, he's the dad.
L329726 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
L329725 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I think it kind of looks like my friend, Paulie.
L329724 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ You're kidding!
L329723 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child.
L329720 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.
L329719 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
L329718 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I wrote that.
L329717 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
L329716 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
L329715 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Oh.
L329714 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Commercials.
L329713 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Like what?
L329712 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ No, more commercial stuff.
L329711 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
L329710 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
