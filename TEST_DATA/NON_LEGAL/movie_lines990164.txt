L410551 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
L410550 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ It's mutating... spreading like a disease.
L410431 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ You cruise A.I.'s, you end up on tape.
L410430 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I have to figure out how to penetrate this thing, Dix... Crack its ice. We gotta get close enough to log the pattern.
L410429 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ Doesn't look like much, but that's King Hell ice, man. Fry your brain out soon as look at you.
L410428 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ Not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying.
L410427 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Can you take me to it?
L410426 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
L410425 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ How are we doing?
L410424 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ Yo.
L410383 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
L410382 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ What?
L410381 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
L410380 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
L410379 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ No problem, amigo.
L410378 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?
L410377 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Nobody has.
L410376 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ Never heard of him.
L410375 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ A guy who calls himself Armitage.
L410374 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ Who got you into this?
L410373 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
L410372 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.
L410316 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ What?
L410315 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
L410314 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
L410313 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
L410312 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Right...
L410311 +++$+++ u6846 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ DIXIE +++$+++ What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?
L410810 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ No!... No...
L410809 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Want to fucking answer them?
L410807 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ The angels... I think they're calling your name.
L410806 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ What?
L410805 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Wait... You hear that?
L410545 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ 3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.
L410544 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ What about the mainframe's access code?
L410498 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ Case. Make yourselves comfortable.  Anyone like a taste?
L410497 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Case.
L410496 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...
L410877 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I don't know. I don't know...
L410876 +++$+++ u6848 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ LINDA LEE +++$+++ Case... are you okay?
L410114 +++$+++ u6848 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ LINDA LEE +++$+++ Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
L410113 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Where did you here that?
L410112 +++$+++ u6848 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ LINDA LEE +++$+++ This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
L410111 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
L410110 +++$+++ u6848 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ LINDA LEE +++$+++ People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
L410109 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
L410108 +++$+++ u6848 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ LINDA LEE +++$+++ Flight's in the morning. You should be on it, too. There's nothing for us here, Case. There never was.
L410107 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I thought you already left.
L410106 +++$+++ u6848 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ LINDA LEE +++$+++ Hello, Case.
L410455 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.
L410454 +++$+++ u6847 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ JULIUS/WINTERMUTE +++$+++ I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.
L410452 +++$+++ u6847 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ JULIUS/WINTERMUTE +++$+++ No, It's you that is full of shit. And blood. And bones. A typically imperfect organic being. You've been hopelessly predictable all along, but you're going to have to do better than that now.
L410451 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I think you're full of shit.
L410450 +++$+++ u6847 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ JULIUS/WINTERMUTE +++$+++ Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
L410449 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Why would you want me to kill you?
L410448 +++$+++ u6847 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ JULIUS/WINTERMUTE +++$+++ I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
L410447 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
L410446 +++$+++ u6847 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ JULIUS/WINTERMUTE +++$+++ Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
L410445 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
L410444 +++$+++ u6847 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ JULIUS/WINTERMUTE +++$+++ You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.
L410443 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ And Linda...
L410442 +++$+++ u6847 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ JULIUS/WINTERMUTE +++$+++ I had to limit your options.
L410441 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
L410440 +++$+++ u6847 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ JULIUS/WINTERMUTE +++$+++ And we really do have to talk.
L410439 +++$+++ u6847 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ JULIUS/WINTERMUTE +++$+++ There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.
L410438 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I know who you are.
L410831 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Hold on.
L410830 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I'm still going in.
L410829 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ You're out of time, man.
L410828 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
L410827 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ What is it?
L410826 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Shit...
L410821 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
L410820 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ My God... these people are insane.
L410818 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ No we don't...
L410817 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ We've still got to find the mainframe.
L410816 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
L410815 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ ...And if I guess wrong?
L410814 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.
L410812 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
L410811 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Is he going to make it?
L410530 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.
L410529 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
L410528 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I know you have. C'mere.
L410527 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Once I kicked, I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. I apprenticed a razor girl in Osaka. Went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. Been taking care of myself just fine ever since.
L410525 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ What went down between you and Riviera?
L410524 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ I know.
L410483 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ For Peter, that's a short trip.
L410482 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
L410481 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ He projects with neural implants.
L410466 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Yeah. One exotic son of a bitch named Riviera.
L410465 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Something exotic I hope.
L410464 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.
L410460 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ So... did you get a look at heaven?
L410459 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I'll be okay.
L410458 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
L410457 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
L410456 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Case... Are you alright?
L410418 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.
L410417 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ What's wrong? Don't like flying?
L410410 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Give me five minutes.
L410409 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Yeah... fine.
L410407 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ They'll cut you down.
L410406 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ I'll get the car.
L410402 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Yeah.
L410401 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I don't sleep much. You packed?
L410400 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Case... it's four a.m.
L410396 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Shhh...
L410395 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Case...
L410394 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ ...Feels like you.
L410393 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Put the gun down, Case.
L410392 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ It sounds like you.
L410391 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
L410390 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
L410325 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ ...Yeah, but the Hosaka's history.
L410324 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ You okay?
L410273 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
L410272 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
L410271 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Dixie McCoy didn't.
L410270 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
L410269 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Won't that mean you're dead?
L410268 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.
L410266 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Suicide. I just needed to set the record straight.
L410265 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Too late?
L410264 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
L410263 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ A regular Fagan.
L410262 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
L410261 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ So you're a wire junkie.
L410260 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ On a good run... yeah.
L410259 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
L410258 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.
L410257 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ If the splices aren't good, you could fry.
L410256 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
L410255 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ You're not ready yet. They said two days.
L410254 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I'm going in.
L410217 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Go ahead...
L410216 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ What the fuck... are you serious?
L410215 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
L410214 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
L410213 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ That's not going to help.
L410212 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Couple of days. They'll examine you.
L410211 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ How soon is soon enough?
L410210 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out.
L410209 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ I gotta know... did it work>
L410208 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Almost two days.
L410207 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ How long have I been out?
L410206 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Hey... you're not supposed to be up.
L410205 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Holy shit...
L410199 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ What?
L410198 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ You've been calling her name.
L410189 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ What's that supposed to mean?
L410188 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Maybe something's onto him.
L410187 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something.
L410186 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
L410185 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
L410184 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ What about before that?
L410183 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Couple of months.
L410182 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?
L410181 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
L410180 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
L410150 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Then, fuck you. I'm gone.
L410149 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
L410148 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ ... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
L410147 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ What is it?
L410145 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ You want to hear the pitch, you gotta meet the man.
L410144 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ What's my end?
L410143 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
L410142 +++$+++ u6845 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ CASE +++$+++ Why should I want to meet him.
L410141 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.
L410851 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Shut up.
L410850 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ What the fuck kind of questions are those?
L410835 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L410834 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ How are you at riddles, Peter?
L410833 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ What?
L410832 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Get up.
L410739 +++$+++ u6853 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ RIVIERA +++$+++ Perversity, darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.
L410738 +++$+++ u6851 +++$+++ m457 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Like what?
