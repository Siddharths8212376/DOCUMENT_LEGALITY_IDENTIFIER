L29152 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ Whaddya got, whaddya got?
L29140 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ Just that on his office wall there's a cartoon with a caption reading, "When you've got them by the balls, their hearts and minds will follow."
L29139 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Thanks, Harry.  Know anything about Colson?
L29138 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman. Just below him are a trio: Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend, and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr. Mitchell we've already discussed. Mr. Colson is the President's special counsel.
L29137 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ The most powerful man in America is President Nixon, probably you've heard his name.
L29136 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Who's Colson, Harry?
L29135 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, "I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?"
L29134 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Who's Charles Colson?
L29122 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ I can't sell hints to Simons--  --you called everyone you know?  Call someone you don't know.
L29121 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Lotsa hints--
L29120 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ What'd you get on W.House?
L29119 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ As a rough rule of thumb, as far as I can throw Bronco Nagurski, that's how much I trust John Mitchell...
L29118 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ You can't believe that.
L29117 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."
L29116 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?
L29115 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?
L29114 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ I did all right on McCord.
L29113 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ OK, get on this W.House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord.
L29107 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ Don't know; who the hell's Howard Hunt?  It's probably nothing but check it out. Just go easy, it could be crazy Cubans.
L29106 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
L29105 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ ...go on, go on...
L29048 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ Two o'clock, work the phones 'til you go.
L29047 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
L29046 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly.  Except  it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters--  --and  these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying--  --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices.  Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.
L29045 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?
L29044 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love?
L29932 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ One Senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes.
L29931 +++$+++ u3632 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SIMONS +++$+++ More denunciations?
L29896 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ --maybe I'm tense--
L29895 +++$+++ u3632 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SIMONS +++$+++ --Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--
L29894 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ --listen, I love this country, you think I want to bring it down?--I'm not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk--
L29891 +++$+++ u3632 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SIMONS +++$+++ --go over your sources again--
L29890 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ --listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it--
L29615 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ --political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?--
L29614 +++$+++ u3632 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SIMONS +++$+++ --has any of them got an ax?--
L29308 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ I know, I did, but damnit Howard--  For the first time since I've known him, I think he's really humping...
L29307 +++$+++ u3632 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SIMONS +++$+++ I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
L29306 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ That was awhile ago.
L29305 +++$+++ u3632 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SIMONS +++$+++ --remember Toronto, Harry.
L29304 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ Howard--
L29303 +++$+++ u3632 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SIMONS +++$+++ Anyone but Bernstein.
L29302 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ I can predict the next words you're gonna say: "anyone but Bernstein."  I want to send a reporter to Miami.
L29112 +++$+++ u3632 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SIMONS +++$+++ Let me see what you get, but don't jump--The New York Times thinks it's crazy Cubans.
L29111 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ Could develop.
L29110 +++$+++ u3632 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SIMONS +++$+++ --in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
L29109 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
L29108 +++$+++ u3632 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SIMONS +++$+++ Anything?
L29833 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ He just did.
L29832 +++$+++ u3632 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SIMONS +++$+++ --well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
L29831 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --and he says Chapin hired Segretti--
L29828 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Larry Young, a California lawyer--
L29827 +++$+++ u3632 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SIMONS +++$+++ --which Young?
L29663 +++$+++ u3632 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SIMONS +++$+++ I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
L29662 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
L29661 +++$+++ u3632 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SIMONS +++$+++ Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.
L29660 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ What do you think Mrs. Graham wants to see me for?
L29617 +++$+++ u3632 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SIMONS +++$+++ --can we use their names?--
L29616 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --no--
L29157 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Absolutely.
L29156 +++$+++ u3632 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SIMONS +++$+++ Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
L29155 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me.  "I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the Democratic National Committee."
L29154 +++$+++ u3632 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SIMONS +++$+++ What else have you got?
L29863 +++$+++ u3633 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Of course--everything they asked--
L29862 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --look, when the Watergate grand jury questioned you, did you name names?
L29859 +++$+++ u3633 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ No, none of those.
L29858 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President.
L29851 +++$+++ u3633 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ A girl. Melissa.
L29850 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ A boy or a girl?
L29602 +++$+++ u3633 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Well, when Liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds, I went to the safe and gave him--out of this whole fortune--I happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me--banks have to keep track of hundreds. If the money had been in fifties, or if I'd grabbed a different stack, there probably wouldn't have been any Watergate story.
L29601 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Go on.
L29598 +++$+++ u3633 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Badly.  You don't realize how close all this came to staying undiscovered--I gave Liddy the Dahlberg check and he gave it to Barker who took it to Miami and deposited it.
L29597 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
L29596 +++$+++ u3633 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I can't say anything, I'm sorry. 
L29592 +++$+++ u3633 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I won't talk about the other two.
L29591 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Haldeman.  Right?
L29590 +++$+++ u3633 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that.
L29586 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ We're not sure we've got all the guys who could order you, but we know there were five. 
L29585 +++$+++ u3633 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ When so ordered.
L29584 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
L29583 +++$+++ u3633 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
L29582 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
L29581 +++$+++ u3633 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
L29580 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Does "they" mean the White House?
L29570 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done--
L29569 +++$+++ u3633 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I'd like to talk to you, I really would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial.
L29566 +++$+++ u3633 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ My wife told me to expect you.  As you know, I haven't talked to the press.
L29565 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Mr. Sloan?
L29449 +++$+++ u3634 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SWEET OLD LADY +++$+++ I'm not Miss Abbott.
L29448 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ You work there, Miss Abbott.
L29447 +++$+++ u3634 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SWEET OLD LADY +++$+++ The what to what?
L29446 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
L29445 +++$+++ u3634 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SWEET OLD LADY +++$+++ --I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.
L29444 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Hi. I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post and I hate to bother you at home--
L34150 +++$+++ u3636 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ CHOIR TEACHER +++$+++ Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
L34149 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ I'll do it.
L34044 +++$+++ u3636 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ CHOIR TEACHER +++$+++ Well then keep it coming.  Alright, people, good work!  Keep it up and we'll do great at the state competition.
L34043 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
L34042 +++$+++ u3636 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ CHOIR TEACHER +++$+++ No, it was good.
L34041 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Sorry.
L34040 +++$+++ u3636 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ CHOIR TEACHER +++$+++ What the hell was that?
L34402 +++$+++ u3637 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ COACH MARSHALL +++$+++ What the fuck is this?  You got someplace more important to be?
L34401 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Sorry, coach.
L34400 +++$+++ u3637 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ COACH MARSHALL +++$+++ Christ!  I didn't say you were out of the game!
L34081 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ -- Thanks, coach --
L34080 +++$+++ u3637 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ COACH MARSHALL +++$+++ You're a killer, Ozzy!
L34079 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Thanks coach.
L34078 +++$+++ u3637 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ COACH MARSHALL +++$+++ Good work, Ostreicher.
L33845 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ I'm not good in math.
L33844 +++$+++ u3638 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ COLLEGE CHICK +++$+++ You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
L33843 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ ...okay...
L33842 +++$+++ u3638 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ COLLEGE CHICK +++$+++ Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
L33841 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Like what?
L33840 +++$+++ u3638 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ COLLEGE CHICK +++$+++ Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
L33838 +++$+++ u3638 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ COLLEGE CHICK +++$+++ You need some work, buddy!
L33837 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova.
L33835 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Suck me...beautiful?
L33834 +++$+++ u3638 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ COLLEGE CHICK +++$+++ What did you just say?
L33832 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ There's something about the spring that's just cool.  Like the smell of fresh rain or something.
L33831 +++$+++ u3638 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ COLLEGE CHICK +++$+++ Sure.
L33830 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Great evening, isn't it?
L34009 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ When was the last time you looked at the facilities here?
L34008 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school?
L34003 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Mochaccino.  Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.
L34002 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?
L33907 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ I thought a fashionably late entrance would enhance my appearance.  When I got here, the Bacchanalia was over and the nymphs had left.
L33906 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
L33905 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Good morning gentleman.
L33766 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ This is no imitation.  Removing the hot dog from the Ultradog yields a better dog.  Behold -- Ultradog, no dog.
L33765 +++$+++ u3642 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
L33764 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.
L34538 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Neither did I!
L34537 +++$+++ u3653 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER'S MOM +++$+++ I had no idea you'd be this good!
L34536 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Yes ma'am, I am.
L34535 +++$+++ u3653 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER'S MOM +++$+++ Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
L34534 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ So...would you object if I said you're quite striking?
L34497 +++$+++ u3653 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER'S MOM +++$+++ Aged eighteen years.  Why don't you get the glasses.  Behind the bar.
L34496 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Single malt?
L34495 +++$+++ u3653 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER'S MOM +++$+++ All right, I got some scotch.
L34494 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ No, no, that's what the cretins drink. I mean alcohol, liquor -- good stuff.
L34493 +++$+++ u3653 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER'S MOM +++$+++ I believe the kegs are upstairs.
L34492 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ ...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
L34491 +++$+++ u3653 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER'S MOM +++$+++ Pardon me?
L34490 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
L34489 +++$+++ u3653 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER'S MOM +++$+++ I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
L34488 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
L34487 +++$+++ u3653 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ STIFLER'S MOM +++$+++ As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
L34486 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Ah, Stifler's mom!  Thank you for letting us have a great party.
L34566 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ So Oz, you almost made it, huh?
L34565 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age.  Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.
L34456 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
L34455 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Me too.  For the most part.
L34382 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ First of all, it's <u>Mocha</u>ccino, and secondly...Oohhhh!
L34381 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
L34380 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Charming.
L34379 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ You're gonna shit your pants!
L34378 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Why is this?
L34377 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Just go!
L34376 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
L34375 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
L34219 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ No idea.
L34218 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ What do you suppose they're saying?
L34192 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Seduce her.
L34191 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ You know, Jim...you could go back there...and...
L34007 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.
L34006 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ What are we gonna hear?
L34005 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
L34004 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Of course, Finch.  What?
L34001 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L34000 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ This.  Right now.
L33999 +++$+++ u3639 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ FINCH +++$+++ Yep.
L33998 +++$+++ u3644 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ This is your plan, Finch?
L34522 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Then don't.
L34521 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy.
L34485 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ I know, it sucks!
L34484 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Hmm.  You know that's  really a shitty middle name!
L34482 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Well, that's what your friends call you.  I mean...I feel like I'm one of your friends now...and also...your girlfriend.
L34481 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ You called me Oz.
L34480 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Oz, it's okay, I know.
L34479 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  And this may sound corny, but --
L34478 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ This isn't any better, Chris.
L34477 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
L34476 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ This isn't the best way to proposition me.
L34475 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ It's gonna sound really bad, but I want you to know.
L34474 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ What's that?
L34473 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.
L34409 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ No.  I'm missing the game for you.
L34408 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ You're missing the game for us?!
L34407 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ I'm not playing.
L34406 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ What about the game?!
L34371 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding.  So I guess...I'll see you later.
L34370 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ ...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
L34369 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
L34368 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ You can't sing at the competition.
L34367 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ ...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
L34340 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ ...yeah.
L34339 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
L34338 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ So we're gonna be close next year?
L34337 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Sure.
L34336 +++$+++ u3648 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ OZ +++$+++ I know.  Salt and pepper?
L34335 +++$+++ u3640 +++$+++ m240 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
