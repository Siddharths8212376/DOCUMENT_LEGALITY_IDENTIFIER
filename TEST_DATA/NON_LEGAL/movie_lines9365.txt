L496968 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ What?
L496961 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I'd like that.
L496960 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.
L496946 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ It might have.
L496945 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
L496944 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ She is very young -- I have an old habit of failure. It would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage.
L496943 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ I don't suppose you'll ever tell her, will you?
L496894 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Perhaps
L496893 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend --  -- and your poetry will speak for you.
L496888 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline. Let her know --
L496887 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ I'm afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my friend. What was in your mind?
L496848 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ I'll do all I can to help. I'll go to my publisher tomorrow.
L496847 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Perhaps.
L496846 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ No other reason —— no woman ——not the little Miss Gibson?
L496845 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I think it's time.
L496844 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ Tell me, why this sudden desire to publish — to awaken like Byron and find yourself famous.
L496843 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ You'll have good enough sense to tell us where she is -— when you know she's a murderess. She killed a man.
L496842 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ Tell me what?
L496841 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Yes. When I tell you.
L496840 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ You don't expect me to do that do you?
L496839 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Tell me where Jacqueline is -— we've got to find her.
L496838 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ I'd forgotten.
L496837 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Wait —- there is that other favor.
L496836 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Why not let your publisher judge that?
L496835 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
L496834 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
L496833 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ And this poetry —— like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?
L496832 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I should like people to read what I've written.
L496831 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ This is curious, Jason. Half the time you talk as if Shakespeare were not fit to tie your shoe—laces; now this sudden humility.
L496829 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ It sounds strange, and I'm going to be very wary.
L496828 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet ——	one as a detective.
L496827 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
L496826 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Uh—huh.
L496825 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ Following me to find Jacqueline?
L496616 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ After that wonderful first book —- after all the adulation and the good reviews?
L496615 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I've lost my knack.
L496614 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
L496613 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
L496612 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ What was she to you?
L496611 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ She was my patient.
L496610 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Because there was another girl— years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once -— I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
L496609 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ But why come to me?
L496608 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
L496606 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ My dear fellow, it's neither your business to ask, nor mine to tell.
L496605 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
L496604 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ What a peculiar question.
L496603 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
L496971 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ I don't know.
L496970 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Would they hurt her?
L496879 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It will be fun meeting Gregory every night at the station.
L496878 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ Yes. You could become a country wife -- fool around with petunias and pullets.
L496520 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ Yes. You know the devil and all his minions are marked that way.
L496519 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Cloven hoof?
L496518 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ It's my cloven hoof. It trips me up sometimes.
L496517 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ If I didn't know where she was, could I take you to her? Get your hat and coat. We haven't much time.
L496516 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You know where she is?
L496515 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
L496514 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ Yes, Miss Gibson. I've come to take you to your sister.
L496513 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Dr. Judd?
L496918 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ No, she's with her sister,
L496917 +++$+++ u2680 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. CORTEZ +++$+++ This is the most amusing thing I have ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it —— your failure with Jacqueline. Has she returned to her husband?
L496916 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ And I love and admire him more than any man I ever knew. I read these poems. He's lost his talent and his was a really great gift. What I have to do today -- to bring him this rejected manuscript -—will be the most disheartening thing I have ever done and the most disillusioning.
L496915 +++$+++ u2680 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. CORTEZ +++$+++ But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
L496914 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ I'm very, very serious.
L496913 +++$+++ u2680 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. CORTEZ +++$+++ This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.
L496911 +++$+++ u2680 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. CORTEZ +++$+++ You're even sentimental about it. What made you change your mind?
L496910 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
L496909 +++$+++ u2680 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. CORTEZ +++$+++ I never thought you did.
L496908 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ But I'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, I'm coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.
L496907 +++$+++ u2680 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. CORTEZ +++$+++ We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
L496906 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you.
L496905 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ No. She's no longer under my care.
L496904 +++$+++ u2680 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. CORTEZ +++$+++ Is it about Jacqueline?
L496731 +++$+++ u2680 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. CORTEZ +++$+++ You're very flippant and perhaps wise, but not wise enough to see the truth, Louis.
L496730 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
L496729 +++$+++ u2680 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. CORTEZ +++$+++ No, you draw no secrets from me, as you drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You're clever, Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm.
L496728 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ Unless what?
L496727 +++$+++ u2680 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. CORTEZ +++$+++ Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
L496726 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
L496725 +++$+++ u2680 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. CORTEZ +++$+++ I was a great dancer...
L496724 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ A gay lot -— Redi, for instance.  I don't know what her sorrow is,	but her life's an empty one. She's had to have this to cling to. Frances Fallon, with her worship of Jacqueline, has had to follow like a sheep. And Bruns, the fanatic. And you...
L496723 +++$+++ u2680 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. CORTEZ +++$+++ Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
L496722 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
L496721 +++$+++ u2680 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. CORTEZ +++$+++ I'm afraid you have mistaken my motive, Louis. I thought you might understand and sympathize.
L496720 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ I can imagine. But you did say you came to me as my friend --that you were concerned for me.
L496719 +++$+++ u2680 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. CORTEZ +++$+++ Yes. There are certain punitive measures...
L496718 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ But you would like to know where she is?
L496717 +++$+++ u2680 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. CORTEZ +++$+++ I haven't said anything of the sort.
L496716 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ Perhaps, Natalie, this is a bargain you're offering me --I am being allowed to join -- to buy safety by betraying Jacqueline -- is that it?
L496715 +++$+++ u2680 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. CORTEZ +++$+++ I always thought it was a more intimate relationship.
L496714 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ I think I can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation. I know too much. I was Jacqueline's psycho-analyst.
L496713 +++$+++ u2680 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. CORTEZ +++$+++ Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --
L496712 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice —— that's it, isn't it?
L496711 +++$+++ u2680 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. CORTEZ +++$+++ It seems right to us.
L496710 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ I'd hardly describe It that way —- The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
L496709 +++$+++ u2680 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. CORTEZ +++$+++ One believes -— it's like any other religion...
L496708 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ I know the others -- Redi, Fallon, Leo, Bruns. But I would never have guessed it of you, Natalie.
L496746 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ I had to help get rid of the body. You saw it on the subway. And I warn you, Mary -- go back -- you don't know what you're doing, or what dreadful things you might bring about by looking for your sister. You go back to school - - go back and forget Jacqueline.
L496745 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I don't believe it.
L496744 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ I have no intention whatsoever of hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.
L496743 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
L496742 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary.
L496741 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ It will make you unhappy to find Jacqueline. It would put her in danger --- great danger --
L496740 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Why?
L496739 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ If I were you, Mary -- I'd go back to school. I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline.
L496738 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say.
L496737 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'll be out in a minute.
L496736 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
L496735 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yes.
L496695 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ That's too bad.
L496694 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm afraid not.
L496272 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ Thank you, my dear.
L496271 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
L496270 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
L496269 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
L496268 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ Yes —— and I must say I've done very well with it -- perhaps even better than Jacqueline.
L496267 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I didn't know.
L496266 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.
L496265 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Mrs. Redi, there's one thing —-with Jacqueline gone, how do you carry on the business? What do you do with the receipts? How do you sign checks--?
L496263 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ I'm afraid not.
L496262 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.
L496302 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Could you let me see that room? If it is hers, there might be something there to help me find my sister.
L496301 +++$+++ u2683 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. ROMARI +++$+++ Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
L496300 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
L496299 +++$+++ u2683 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. ROMARI +++$+++ Oh yes, yes. One day a beautiful car comes here. This beautiful lady in furs gets out. There is a handsome man with her, and the chauffeur  The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms. The chauffeur changes the lock on the door. Then the lady never comes back --not to live, anyhow. She came back three, four times, but always alone and just to eat.
L496298 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ But she was here?
L496297 +++$+++ u2683 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. ROMARI +++$+++ She's not been here for a long time.
L496296 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yes —— yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
L496293 +++$+++ u2683 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. ROMARI +++$+++ Giacomo -- la bellisslina madonna —-
L496292 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Once you'd seen my sister you'd never forget her.
L496252 +++$+++ u2681 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. LOWOOD +++$+++ I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman. But if  you'd like to try, I'll advance you the money to make the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister, you can always come back here.
L496251 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself --
L496249 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Of course.
L496248 +++$+++ u2681 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. LOWOOD +++$+++ I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
L496247 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
L496246 +++$+++ u2681 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. LOWOOD +++$+++ We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.
L496245 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
L496244 +++$+++ u2681 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. LOWOOD +++$+++ That makes it all the more difficult ——
L496242 +++$+++ u2681 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. LOWOOD +++$+++ Have you any other relatives, Mary?
L496241 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
L496240 +++$+++ u2681 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. LOWOOD +++$+++ Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
L496307 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What did he say?
L496306 +++$+++ u2686 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ ROMARI +++$+++ Fo come ti pare. To desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza.
L496304 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Please.
L496303 +++$+++ u2686 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ ROMARI +++$+++ No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.
L496290 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ She's very beautiful.
L496289 +++$+++ u2686 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ ROMARI +++$+++ I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
L496288 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
L496287 +++$+++ u2686 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ ROMARI +++$+++ Yes?
L496286 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm worry to bother you. I want to ask you about my sister.
L496929 +++$+++ u2684 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ When?
L496928 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
L496927 +++$+++ u2684 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ What?
L496926 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Because I have something very important to do.
L496925 +++$+++ u2684 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Why
L496924 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Children, I want you to be very good and very quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She's going to take over this class for a while.
L496498 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
L496497 +++$+++ u2684 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Is it fifteen minutes yet?
L496490 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
L496489 +++$+++ u2684 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.
L496780 +++$+++ u2679 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MR. BRUNS +++$+++ Then it is decided. Leo and Durk and I will make our plans.
L496779 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ I have taken care of Mary. I've spoken to her. She's going back to school.
L496776 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ What about Judd -- he knows about us.
L496775 +++$+++ u2679 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MR. BRUNS +++$+++ It is a very real danger and one which forces our decision.
L496772 +++$+++ u2679 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MR. BRUNS +++$+++ I know this is difficult for you. I know that you love her.
L496771 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ But she told him, Frances. She told him about us.
L496766 +++$+++ u2679 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MR. BRUNS +++$+++ I can quote that too; "Those who shall go out into the market place and let their tongues speak of us, and give knowledge of our being and our deeds, whom-so-ever doeth this shall die."
L496765 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ But he also wrote --
L496764 +++$+++ u2679 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MR. BRUNS +++$+++ I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
L496763 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz -- I read what he wrote --
L496939 +++$+++ u2680 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. CORTEZ +++$+++ It won't hurt.
L496938 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ You have only to stretch out your hand, take up the glass and drink a little.
L496935 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
L496934 +++$+++ u2680 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. CORTEZ +++$+++ Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.
L496752 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ I should have known. She had no sincerity —- no real belief.
L496751 +++$+++ u2680 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. CORTEZ +++$+++ I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell —-
L496750 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very trying for me.
L496748 +++$+++ u2680 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. CORTEZ +++$+++ We haven't even begun tea yet.
L496747 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
L497959 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I'm okay. It's okay.
L497958 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Graham...
L497955 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No.
L497954 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I want to touch you.
L497952 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No, Ann, I can't. I can't forget it. It's not something I can fix. It's difficult. There s something in my mind... the way my brain works...  God, Ann, when you're with another person, and you're... inside them, you're so vulnerable, you're revealing so much... there's no protection. And... somebody could say, or do something to you while you're in this... state of... nakedness. And they could hurt you without even knowing it. In a way that you couldn't even see.  And you would withdraw. To make sure it didn't happen again.
L497951 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
L497950 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ And I'm telling you it's not any one thing that I can point to and say "That's why!" It doesn't work that way with people who have problems, Ann, it's not that neat, it's not that tidy! It's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count. Things just don't happen that way.
L497949 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I want to know why you are the way you are!
L497948 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Well, what kind of answer are you looking for, Ann? What is it exactly that you want to know?
L497947 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ You're not answering me.
L497946 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.
L497945 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Why are you ashamed?
L497944 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ All right!! All right!! You want to know? You want to know how I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that what you wanted to hear?
L497943 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Come on!!
L497941 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I don't care.
L497940 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting --
L497939 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
L497938 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I can't tell you like this.
L497937 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ "Because"? That's not good enough. I asked you a question, Graham. I asked you "how does it feel"? How does it feel, Mr. I Want To Go Down On You But I Can't? Do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? Including me? Come on, how does it feel?
L497936 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Because.
L497935 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Why not?
