L552683 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ Damn you, de Sade!  You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual, whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.
L552682 +++$+++ u7913 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ AMBASSADOR DE SADE +++$+++ Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
L552681 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ Yes?
L552598 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ The report is entirely untrue.  I can assure you of that.
L552597 +++$+++ u7913 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ AMBASSADOR DE SADE +++$+++ The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
L552596 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ That's preposterous!  We have no such program!
L552595 +++$+++ u7913 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ AMBASSADOR DE SADE +++$+++ But, finally, one factor tipped the scales. We received information from a very re- liable source that your country was going to build one.
L552593 +++$+++ u7913 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ AMBASSADOR DE SADE +++$+++ First of all, economic reasons.  It was cheap.  The entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs. It also seemed ideal in most other respects. It was terrifying, convincing, automatic, and extremely simple to understand.
L552592 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ Mister Ambassador, what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon?
L552585 +++$+++ u7913 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ AMBASSADOR DE SADE +++$+++ It is buried somewhere in the Grudd Mountains.
L552584 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ Where is this...thing?
L552583 +++$+++ u7913 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ AMBASSADOR DE SADE +++$+++ Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.
L552582 +++$+++ u7913 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ AMBASSADOR DE SADE +++$+++ Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device, the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years.
L552545 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ I'll hold this, if you don't mind.  You can have it back when you leave.
L552544 +++$+++ u7913 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ AMBASSADOR DE SADE +++$+++ I am sorry.  Sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.
L552543 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ What's the meaning of this?
L552536 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ Did you get that, Kulnick?
L552535 +++$+++ u7913 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ AMBASSADOR DE SADE +++$+++ If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
L552534 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ At his office in the Capitol.
L552533 +++$+++ u7913 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ AMBASSADOR DE SADE +++$+++ Where are you trying to reach him?
L552530 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ Yes, of course.
L552529 +++$+++ u7913 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ AMBASSADOR DE SADE +++$+++ I have your word, Mister President?
L552528 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ Don't be ridiculous.
L552527 +++$+++ u7913 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ AMBASSADOR DE SADE +++$+++ The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?
L552526 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
L552525 +++$+++ u7913 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ AMBASSADOR DE SADE +++$+++ Thank you, Admiral.
L552517 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ Moffo!
L552516 +++$+++ u7913 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ AMBASSADOR DE SADE +++$+++ Possibly some coffee?
L552515 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ Certainly - how about some breakfast?
L552514 +++$+++ u7913 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ AMBASSADOR DE SADE +++$+++ Can I have a glass of water?
L552513 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ All right, Mister Ambassador!  But you must treat General "Buck" Schmuck with the respect due him.
L552512 +++$+++ u7913 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ AMBASSADOR DE SADE +++$+++ War-mongering bully!  Don't think you're going to intimidate me!
L552503 +++$+++ u7913 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ AMBASSADOR DE SADE +++$+++ You will not get away with this vicious attack on our peace-loving people.
L552502 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ Please be calm, Ambassador De Sade.
L552941 +++$+++ u7913 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ AMBASSADOR DE SADE +++$+++ One, two...  three, four...  five...  Why you, dirty, stinking...
L552940 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ That's right, fella.
L552939 +++$+++ u7913 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ AMBASSADOR DE SADE +++$+++ My seven body orifices????
L552936 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ See!  See, I told you.
L552935 +++$+++ u7913 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ AMBASSADOR DE SADE +++$+++ Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left. 
L552610 +++$+++ u7913 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ AMBASSADOR DE SADE +++$+++ It's not a he, General.  It was an article in the "Times" about a year and a half ago.
L552609 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ You mean you'll tell us his name???
L552608 +++$+++ u7913 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ AMBASSADOR DE SADE +++$+++ Perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source?
L552591 +++$+++ u7913 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ AMBASSADOR DE SADE +++$+++ Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.
L552590 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
L552589 +++$+++ u7913 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ AMBASSADOR DE SADE +++$+++ You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
L552588 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they?
L552587 +++$+++ u7913 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ AMBASSADOR DE SADE +++$+++ Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
L552586 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ Do you mean to say you'd set it off in your own country?
L552542 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ What do you think of this, Mister President?  I told you we shouldn't let him in here.
L552541 +++$+++ u7913 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ AMBASSADOR DE SADE +++$+++ Give that back to me.
L552540 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
L552539 +++$+++ u7913 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ AMBASSADOR DE SADE +++$+++ Don't you dare touch me!  What the devil do you think you're doing?
L552509 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ Mister President, are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this?
L552508 +++$+++ u7913 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ AMBASSADOR DE SADE +++$+++ Premier Belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie.
L552625 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Who the hell do you think you are, sir???
L552624 +++$+++ u7914 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ COLONEL "BAT" GUANO +++$+++ Now, snap out of it, fella!
L552623 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ It might still be worth trying Riki-Tiki- Tavi.  R...T...T...There's only three combinations of -- T...T...R, or T...R...T...
L552622 +++$+++ u7914 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ COLONEL "BAT" GUANO +++$+++ Get a grip on yourself, Major!
L552621 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ The three-letter code group.  Or maybe some combination of the three letters. P...O...E, or P...E...O, or E...O...P... let's see, there would be six possible combinations.
L552620 +++$+++ u7914 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ COLONEL "BAT" GUANO +++$+++ What are you talking about, Major?
L552619 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.
L552618 +++$+++ u7914 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ COLONEL "BAT" GUANO +++$+++ Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
L552617 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
L552616 +++$+++ u7914 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ COLONEL "BAT" GUANO +++$+++ Major?...Major?  I'm Colonel "Bat" Guano, 701 Battalion.
L552662 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Colonel, remember, a reprimand from the President can be pretty serious to a career officer...Just a second, operator, I know I have it somewhere.
L552661 +++$+++ u7915 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ COLONEL GUANO +++$+++ That's government property, Major.
L552660 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.
L552653 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Well, I'm General Ripper's Executive officer. He'll want to talk to me.
L552652 +++$+++ u7915 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ COLONEL GUANO +++$+++ So what?
L552651 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he?
L552650 +++$+++ u7915 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ COLONEL GUANO +++$+++ What about the President?
L552649 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
L552648 +++$+++ u7915 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ COLONEL GUANO +++$+++ You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
L552647 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
L552646 +++$+++ u7915 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ COLONEL GUANO +++$+++ On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
L552645 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
L552644 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect... 
L552643 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Sure...sure, Colonel.  Now look, I'm picking up the phone...nice and slow.  Right?...Hello? ...Hello?  Hello?...Hello?...Gee, it must be edad. Probably the lines were hit during the fighting.
L552642 +++$+++ u7915 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ COLONEL GUANO +++$+++ Okay, fella.  But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.
L552641 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Look, Colonel.  You keep me covered, but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay?
L552640 +++$+++ u7915 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ COLONEL GUANO +++$+++ They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
L552639 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Didn't they tell you?
L552638 +++$+++ u7915 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ COLONEL GUANO +++$+++ You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
L552637 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
L552636 +++$+++ u7915 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ COLONEL GUANO +++$+++ Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
L552635 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
L552634 +++$+++ u7915 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ COLONEL GUANO +++$+++ Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
L552633 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
L552632 +++$+++ u7915 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ COLONEL GUANO +++$+++ We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
L552631 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Look, I didn't shoot him!
L552630 +++$+++ u7915 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ COLONEL GUANO +++$+++ What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
L552629 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ What?
L552628 +++$+++ u7915 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ COLONEL GUANO +++$+++ Do you have any witnesses, Major?
L552627 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Well, you can't do that because he's dead.
L552626 +++$+++ u7915 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ COLONEL GUANO +++$+++ I did that for your own good, fella.  Now I'm not going to pull rank on you.  When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing.  Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President.
L552190 +++$+++ u7916 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ COLONEL PUNTRICH +++$+++ Now look here, Miss Pietraszkiewicz, this is Air Command Headquarters calling.
L552189 +++$+++ u7929 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR +++$+++ Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.
L552188 +++$+++ u7916 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ COLONEL PUNTRICH +++$+++ What did you say?
L552187 +++$+++ u7929 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR +++$+++ Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
L552186 +++$+++ u7916 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ COLONEL PUNTRICH +++$+++ What is your name, young lady?
L552185 +++$+++ u7929 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR +++$+++ I'm sorry, sir.  General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty.
L552207 +++$+++ u7916 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ COLONEL PUNTRICH +++$+++ Well, that's the funny part of it, too, sir.  It doesn't show a damned thing.
L552206 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ Does the threat board show anything?
L552205 +++$+++ u7916 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ COLONEL PUNTRICH +++$+++ I know it sounds crazy, sir, but we tried, and nobody answers any of the telephones.
L552204 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ Well, that's ridiculous.  If the teleprinter and radio links are out of order, just pick up a phone and pay for a call.
L552202 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ Then why bother me with this nonsense? Get in touch with the base commander.
L552201 +++$+++ u7916 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ COLONEL PUNTRICH +++$+++ No, sir.
L552200 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?
L552199 +++$+++ u7916 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ COLONEL PUNTRICH +++$+++ General Schmuck, we monitored a trans- mission about six minutes ago from Burpelson Air Force Base, HQ 843rd Wing.  It was apparently directed to their Wing on air- borne alert.  It decoded as - Wing attack, Plan-R.
L552198 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ I didn't say anything.  What's the meaning of disturbing me at this hour, Colonel?
L552197 +++$+++ u7916 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ COLONEL PUNTRICH +++$+++ What did you say, sir?
L552196 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ Go back to sleep, baby.
L552193 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ Yes!  Who the hell is this?
L552192 +++$+++ u7916 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ COLONEL PUNTRICH +++$+++ General Schmuck?
L552191 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ Yes!
L552928 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.
L552927 +++$+++ u7917 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL "BUCK" SCHMUCK +++$+++ Just a second, sir.  He's got films of the War Room in that thing!
L552228 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ Buck, when I told you to give them right up to the top, you said we couldn't insult a general officer by asking him to pass a test to see if he's a psycho.
L552227 +++$+++ u7917 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL "BUCK" SCHMUCK +++$+++ Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
L552226 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ Damn it!  Damn it!  I've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.
L552225 +++$+++ u7917 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL "BUCK" SCHMUCK +++$+++ Not exactly, sir.  You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said:  "Sure, the orders came from me.  They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now."  Then he hung up.
L552224 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ You aren't sure!
L552223 +++$+++ u7917 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL "BUCK" SCHMUCK +++$+++ To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
L552222 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ???
L552221 +++$+++ u7917 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL "BUCK" SCHMUCK +++$+++ Yes, sir.  He issued attack orders to --
L552220 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ General Schmuck?
L552219 +++$+++ u7917 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL "BUCK" SCHMUCK +++$+++ Well, sir, about forty-six minutes ago one of my base commanders, General Jack D. Ripper, sent out attack orders to the thirty-four B-90's of the 843rd Bomb Wing, under his command.
L552218 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ What kind of trouble?
L552217 +++$+++ u7917 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL "BUCK" SCHMUCK +++$+++ Well, Mister President.
L552678 +++$+++ u7918 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL FACEMAN +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L552677 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
L552676 +++$+++ u7918 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL FACEMAN +++$+++ I didn't speak to him, sir.  But Colonel "Bat" Guano was in command of the Special Service battalion, so I would imagine he did.
L552275 +++$+++ u7918 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL FACEMAN +++$+++ That certainly would be a problem, sir.
L552274 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
L552273 +++$+++ u7918 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL FACEMAN +++$+++ But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
L552272 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
L552271 +++$+++ u7918 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL FACEMAN +++$+++ Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
L552270 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
L552269 +++$+++ u7918 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL FACEMAN +++$+++ Thank you, sir.  But what shall I tell them to do if they are denied entrance?
L552268 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ That's a very wise deduction, General.
L552267 +++$+++ u7918 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL FACEMAN +++$+++ Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
L552266 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
L552265 +++$+++ u7918 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL FACEMAN +++$+++ Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
L552264 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ Yes?
L552263 +++$+++ u7918 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL FACEMAN +++$+++ Yes, sir.  One thing, Mister President.
L552125 +++$+++ u7919 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER +++$+++ And lastly, all privately owned radios are to be immediately impounded.  They can be used to issue instructions to saboteurs. Air Police will have lists of all owners.
L552124 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L552123 +++$+++ u7919 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER +++$+++ Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
L552122 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Thank you, sir.
L552121 +++$+++ u7919 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER +++$+++ You're a good officer, Major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention.
L552120 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
L552119 +++$+++ u7919 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER +++$+++ Are you questioning my orders, Major?
L552118 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter.
L552117 +++$+++ u7919 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER +++$+++ As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.
L552116 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
L552115 +++$+++ u7919 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER +++$+++ Are you hard of hearing, Major?
L552114 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Plan-R????
L552113 +++$+++ u7919 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER +++$+++ I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.
L552112 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ No, sir.
L552111 +++$+++ u7919 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER +++$+++ Are you trying to be insubordinate?
L552110 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ To you, sir.  But how do I know?
L552109 +++$+++ u7919 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER +++$+++ Who do you think you're talking to?
L552108 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?
L552107 +++$+++ u7919 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER +++$+++ No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
L552106 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.
L552105 +++$+++ u7919 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER +++$+++ No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls.
L552104 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ You're right, sir.
L552103 +++$+++ u7919 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER +++$+++ We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
L552102 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ That's right, sir.
L552101 +++$+++ u7919 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER +++$+++ Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command.
L552098 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L552097 +++$+++ u7919 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER +++$+++ Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.
L552096 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
L552095 +++$+++ u7919 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER +++$+++ Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
L552094 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ A shooting war!
L552093 +++$+++ u7919 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER +++$+++ You're a good officer, Major Mandrake.  You have a right to know.  It looks like we're in a shooting war!
L552092 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
L552091 +++$+++ u7919 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER +++$+++ That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
L552090 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Condition Red!
L552089 +++$+++ u7919 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER +++$+++ All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
L552088 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L552087 +++$+++ u7919 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER +++$+++ Good.  Has the Wing confirmed holding at X-points?
L552086 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ No, sir.
L552085 +++$+++ u7919 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER +++$+++ Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
L552084 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
L552083 +++$+++ u7919 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER +++$+++ Why do you think I ask?
L552082 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Certainly, General.  Why do you ask, sir?
L552081 +++$+++ u7919 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER +++$+++ Do you recognize my voice?
L552080 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L552079 +++$+++ u7919 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER +++$+++ This is General Ripper speaking.
L552078 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
L552569 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.
L552568 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.
L552566 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Peace on earth.
L552565 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ To peace on earth, Major.
L552563 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
L552562 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ Major, those are my boys out there dying.
L552398 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ Major, I hate to say this, but I think you've been enemy indoctrinated, and you don't even know it.
L552397 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
L552396 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ Do you think they would cheat?
