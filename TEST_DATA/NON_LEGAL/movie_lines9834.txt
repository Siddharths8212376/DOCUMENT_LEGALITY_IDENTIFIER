L220940 +++$+++ u5371 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ SMILEY +++$+++ Anyway you want it, asshole.
L220939 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Let me go out like a man.
L220938 +++$+++ u5371 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ SMILEY +++$+++ The point?
L220937 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!
L220936 +++$+++ u5371 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ SMILEY +++$+++ How's it going?
L220835 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Okay.  'B-y-e!
L220834 +++$+++ u5371 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ SMILEY +++$+++ <u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
L220833 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ I want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.
L220595 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Say cheese...
L220594 +++$+++ u5371 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ SMILEY +++$+++ Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
L220593 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!
L220507 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ <u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
L220506 +++$+++ u5371 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ SMILEY +++$+++ Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
L220505 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ The case!
L220504 +++$+++ u5371 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ SMILEY +++$+++ Off what?  Twenty seconds...
L220503 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ I'm off it!
L220502 +++$+++ u5371 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ SMILEY +++$+++ What's fine?
L220501 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Fine!
L220500 +++$+++ u5371 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ SMILEY +++$+++ Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
L220499 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
L220498 +++$+++ u5371 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ SMILEY +++$+++ Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.
L220496 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Whatever you're getting paid, I can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more.
L220495 +++$+++ u5371 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ SMILEY +++$+++ Polo.
L220917 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Julian, you're fired.
L220916 +++$+++ u5365 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ GRENDEL +++$+++ I'm still the king!
L220909 +++$+++ u5365 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ GRENDEL +++$+++ Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look.
L220908 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
L220903 +++$+++ u5365 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ GRENDEL +++$+++ What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
L220902 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
L220901 +++$+++ u5365 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ GRENDEL +++$+++ When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
L220900 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
L220899 +++$+++ u5365 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ GRENDEL +++$+++ Fuck me...
L220898 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies I made...
L220897 +++$+++ u5365 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ GRENDEL +++$+++ Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --
L220896 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ You'd said something about proof...
L220804 +++$+++ u5365 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ GRENDEL +++$+++ Ciao.
L220803 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Shit.
L220802 +++$+++ u5365 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ GRENDEL +++$+++ Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
L220801 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ When I say 'no,' run for the door.
L220799 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Are you okay?
L220798 +++$+++ u5365 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ GRENDEL +++$+++ Kill them.  Not quickly.
L220788 +++$+++ u5365 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ GRENDEL +++$+++ Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.
L220787 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ What about Don?
L220786 +++$+++ u5365 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ GRENDEL +++$+++ I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
L220785 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?
L220783 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Ah, I didn't say seven <u>P</u>.M., now did I?
L220782 +++$+++ u5365 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ GRENDEL +++$+++ It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
L220781 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ <u>Okay</u>!  Okay.  You got me.  Boy, you guys are tough.  I have the third disc.  Indeed.  I.  Do. Yes, sir.  Yeah you assholes, it's in a very safe place with instructions to have it sent directly to the police if I don't make a phone call by seven o'clock.  So if you'll excuse us...
L220777 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
L220776 +++$+++ u5365 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ GRENDEL +++$+++ It doesn't have to be like this?
L220772 +++$+++ u5365 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ GRENDEL +++$+++ Don't play games... ugh.  Did you say you don't have the third... ugh.  I'm not going to torture <u>you</u>, Ford.
L220771 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  Shit, just start torturing me, man.  I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.
L220770 +++$+++ u5365 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ GRENDEL +++$+++ Actually you're a bit off in the motivation department... I mean, revenge is so... Bronson.  Wait, where's the third C.D.?  How could you come here without proof? It's a three piece set here!  A computer disc from Colleen, Bobby's computer disc, and Johnny's computer disc.  Together they make, oh fucking forget it!
L220765 +++$+++ u5365 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ GRENDEL +++$+++ Golly, I'd probably faint.
L220764 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
L220763 +++$+++ u5365 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ GRENDEL +++$+++ Shock.
L220762 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Uh, nice piano.  Probably get a lot of complaints from the neighbors -- heh...  It's another time, Julian, another place.  If I told you Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and Colleen Sutton were the ones you were complaining about, the ones who tried to rip you off, what would your reaction be?
L220552 +++$+++ u5365 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ GRENDEL +++$+++ Go on, another time, another place.
L220551 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Jazz, we're talking here.
L220547 +++$+++ u5365 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ GRENDEL +++$+++ Don't worry I can run every ballet note for note in my brain...
L220546 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
L220545 +++$+++ u5365 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ GRENDEL +++$+++ So what did you think of the ballet? Was it like a warm Ice Capades?
L220542 +++$+++ u5365 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ GRENDEL +++$+++ I must say you're an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea.
L220541 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
L220540 +++$+++ u5365 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ GRENDEL +++$+++ Well, hello, Ford.
L220465 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ I was just discussing this whole Vomit thing with my friend Art Mooney.  Do you know him?
L220464 +++$+++ u5365 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ GRENDEL +++$+++ Terrible thing, but good career move.  His record sales have gone way up.  I'll just have to create a new Black Vomit.
L220461 +++$+++ u5365 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ GRENDEL +++$+++ An asshole?  A swine?  A ballistic turd?  Pick one.  I never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and I had to take over the company.  You see the music is irrelevant in this industry.  I'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.
L220460 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ I knew your father.  He was quite...
L220459 +++$+++ u5365 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ GRENDEL +++$+++ Why thank you.  It's a Christmas present.  That was my sense of humor, everyone.  I wish you would fake a laugh.  It's easy with a deaf person.
L220458 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
L220457 +++$+++ u5365 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ GRENDEL +++$+++ Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.
L220456 +++$+++ u5365 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ GRENDEL +++$+++ Actually that's rather an intriguing idea...
L220455 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ How could Grendel Records sign such a wick-prick?  I guess Julian Grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob.  I hear Ray Charles is going to head up the video division.
L220746 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ It is to us!  It's computerised.
L220745 +++$+++ u5369 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ MELODI +++$+++ This isn't music!
L220716 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Hebedeebuh.  Hebedeebuh.  Maybe I did die in the explosion.
L220715 +++$+++ u5369 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ MELODI +++$+++ Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.
L220713 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Hey, the poet...
L220712 +++$+++ u5369 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ MELODI +++$+++ Hi, private eye guy!
L220267 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
L220266 +++$+++ u5369 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ MELODI +++$+++ You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
L220265 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ That's funny, you're cute.
L220264 +++$+++ u5369 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ MELODI +++$+++ That's cute.  You're funny.
L220263 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Only on a first name basis.
L220262 +++$+++ u5369 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ MELODI +++$+++ Do you really know everybody in the industry?
L220261 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ You're a poet and didn't know it.
L220260 +++$+++ u5369 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ MELODI +++$+++ You're that guy, the private eye.
L220367 +++$+++ u5367 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ I hope you solve the case and I know you will, because you're the best.  Ford, guys like you don't grow on trees.
L220366 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
L220365 +++$+++ u5367 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
L220364 +++$+++ u5367 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Just find her, man.  She's my daughter, she's my sister, she's my mother, she's some little brat I stood in line with at Taco Bell last week.  Do whatever you want with my words.  And my money.
L220363 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
L220362 +++$+++ u5367 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ So...
L220359 +++$+++ u5367 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ What?
L220358 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ 'Bye, Johnny...
L220357 +++$+++ u5367 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
L220356 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ How nice.
L220355 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Friendship's a lot different out here.  A wrong number is a relationship.  But then this isn't a social call.
L220354 +++$+++ u5367 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
L220353 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
L220352 +++$+++ u5367 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
L220351 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ I don't believe it.  Getting paid to be the asshole you always were.
L223511 +++$+++ u5374 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ 1ST MAN +++$+++ What?
L223510 +++$+++ u5382 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
L223509 +++$+++ u5374 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ 1ST MAN +++$+++ Mr. Doyle.
L223508 +++$+++ u5382 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ What?
L223507 +++$+++ u5374 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ 1ST MAN +++$+++ Doyle.
L223506 +++$+++ u5382 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ What's my name?
L223559 +++$+++ u5375 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ 2ND MAN +++$+++ This side.
L223558 +++$+++ u5382 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Where do you want it?
L223557 +++$+++ u5375 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ 2ND MAN +++$+++ Who knows?
L223556 +++$+++ u5382 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Who brings it?
L223555 +++$+++ u5375 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ 2ND MAN +++$+++ Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.
L223554 +++$+++ u5382 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ What?
L223553 +++$+++ u5375 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ 2ND MAN +++$+++ No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
L223552 +++$+++ u5382 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Got a wife named Angie.
L223551 +++$+++ u5375 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ 2ND MAN +++$+++ Doesn't register.
L223550 +++$+++ u5382 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ B.O.C.A.
L223549 +++$+++ u5375 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ 2ND MAN +++$+++ Boca?
L223548 +++$+++ u5382 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
L223547 +++$+++ u5375 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ 2ND MAN +++$+++ There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.
L223546 +++$+++ u5382 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk.
L223545 +++$+++ u5375 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ 2ND MAN +++$+++ Everything is everything.
L223544 +++$+++ u5382 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ How's everything?
L223541 +++$+++ u5382 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Cause if I do.
L223540 +++$+++ u5375 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ 2ND MAN +++$+++ No - no.
L223539 +++$+++ u5382 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?
L223538 +++$+++ u5375 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ 2ND MAN +++$+++ No. 
L223537 +++$+++ u5382 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ You don't use shit?
L223536 +++$+++ u5375 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ 2ND MAN +++$+++ I'm clean.
L223535 +++$+++ u5382 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ What about you?  Can you stand a toss?
L223616 +++$+++ u5376 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ ANGIE +++$+++ Don't forget anchovies. 
L223615 +++$+++ u5390 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Yeah?
L223614 +++$+++ u5376 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ ANGIE +++$+++ Sal --

L223612 +++$+++ u5376 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ ANGIE +++$+++ Well try, okay?
L223611 +++$+++ u5390 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
L223610 +++$+++ u5376 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ ANGIE +++$+++ -- Well finish all your meetin' people and get back here now -- and bring a pizza with you.
L223609 +++$+++ u5390 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ You know I hadda meet some people tonight --

L223606 +++$+++ u5376 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ ANGIE +++$+++ Where are you?
L223394 +++$+++ u5382 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ You made three sales to your roaches back there.  We had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me you're clean?
L223393 +++$+++ u5377 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ BLACK PUSHER +++$+++ Man, I'm clean.
L223392 +++$+++ u5382 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Did you ever sit on the edge of the bed, take off your socks and stick your fingers between your toes?
L223391 +++$+++ u5377 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ BLACK PUSHER +++$+++ No... yeah...
L223390 +++$+++ u5382 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
L223389 +++$+++ u5377 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ BLACK PUSHER +++$+++ I don't know what you're talkin' about.
L223388 +++$+++ u5382 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
L223387 +++$+++ u5377 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ BLACK PUSHER +++$+++ What?
L223386 +++$+++ u5382 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
L223385 +++$+++ u5377 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ BLACK PUSHER +++$+++ I don't...
L223381 +++$+++ u5377 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ BLACK PUSHER +++$+++ Fuck you, Santa Claus!
L223380 +++$+++ u5382 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ What's your name, asshole?
L223937 +++$+++ u5381 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ DEVEREAUX +++$+++ Goodbye.
L223936 +++$+++ u5378 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ CHARNIER +++$+++ Calm down -- Henri!  You must trust me -- this is an extremely complicated situation to which there is a simple solution if you do exactly what I tell you.  It's worth more money to you.
L223934 +++$+++ u5378 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ CHARNIER +++$+++ Not quite -- you are in it whether you like it or not.  The police know you brought the car into the country.  This makes you an accomplice.
L223933 +++$+++ u5381 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ DEVEREAUX +++$+++ My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
L223932 +++$+++ u5378 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ CHARNIER +++$+++ Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...
L223931 +++$+++ u5381 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ DEVEREAUX +++$+++ I wasn't looking.
L223930 +++$+++ u5378 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ CHARNIER +++$+++ Did they follow you?
L223929 +++$+++ u5381 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ DEVEREAUX +++$+++ It is waiting for you in the garage.
L223928 +++$+++ u5378 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ CHARNIER +++$+++ Did you pick up the car?
L223466 +++$+++ u5381 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ DEVEREAUX +++$+++ Enchanté.  Alain, j'ai réfléchi à votre proposition et j'ai décidé d'accepter.
L223465 +++$+++ u5378 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ CHARNIER +++$+++ Henri c'est gentil d'être venu.  Je vous présente mon associé, Pierre Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux.
L223848 +++$+++ u5390 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ It's yours too!
L223847 +++$+++ u5378 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ CHARNIER +++$+++ It's your problem.
L223846 +++$+++ u5390 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
L223845 +++$+++ u5378 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ CHARNIER +++$+++ It has to be by the end of this week.
L223844 +++$+++ u5390 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Hell no -- my end is covered -- my associates just feel we ought to wait for a more opportune time to make the switch.
L223843 +++$+++ u5378 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ CHARNIER +++$+++ Are you having trouble raising the half million?
L223842 +++$+++ u5390 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
L223841 +++$+++ u5378 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ CHARNIER +++$+++ You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
L223840 +++$+++ u5390 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
L223644 +++$+++ u5390 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Yes --
L223643 +++$+++ u5378 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ CHARNIER +++$+++ Twelve o'clock... yes...
L223640 +++$+++ u5378 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ CHARNIER +++$+++ ... Salvatore?...
L223639 +++$+++ u5390 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Who's this --
L223638 +++$+++ u5378 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ CHARNIER +++$+++ Allo... Salvatore...
L223853 +++$+++ u5378 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ CHARNIER +++$+++ That's a relief.
L223852 +++$+++ u5385 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ I'm going to put them on the cat.
L223851 +++$+++ u5378 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ CHARNIER +++$+++ Are you sure it is dead?
L223630 +++$+++ u5378 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ CHARNIER +++$+++ Not any woman, Marie.  Just one.
L223629 +++$+++ u5385 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Alain is the only man I know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman.
L223455 +++$+++ u5378 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ CHARNIER +++$+++ Non!
L223454 +++$+++ u5385 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Le sommes nous?
L223453 +++$+++ u5378 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ CHARNIER +++$+++ Je n'ai jamais vu tant de sérenité. Elle m'a demandé de tes nouvelles et si nous étions heureux.
L223452 +++$+++ u5385 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Comment va-t-elle?
L223451 +++$+++ u5378 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ CHARNIER +++$+++ Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis passé voir Françoise.
L223450 +++$+++ u5385 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
L223449 +++$+++ u5378 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ CHARNIER +++$+++ Pour moi?
L223448 +++$+++ u5385 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Mais non, c'est pour toi.
L223447 +++$+++ u5378 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ CHARNIER +++$+++ Avec ça tu pourras le supporter.
L223446 +++$+++ u5385 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Regarde mon pêcheur de baleine... Tu sais il va faire très froid cet hiver.
L223445 +++$+++ u5378 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ CHARNIER +++$+++ Encore du sho ping!
L223444 +++$+++ u5385 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Oh Alain!  C'est merveilleux!  Tu me gâtes.  Je t'aime.  Attends, je vais te montrer moi aussi ce que j'ai acheté.
L223443 +++$+++ u5378 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ CHARNIER +++$+++ Si tu veux.
L223442 +++$+++ u5385 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
L223441 +++$+++ u5378 +++$+++ m357 +++$+++ CHARNIER +++$+++ Tu sais j'ai réfléchi longuement à ton cadeau pour le voyage.  Je l'ai choisi moi-même.  Tiens.
