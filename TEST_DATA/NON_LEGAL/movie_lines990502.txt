L645267 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...
L645266 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.
L645265 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.
L645264 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?
L645263 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You think I'm gonna broker the rest of my life... I'm going to be a giant, Darien, an entrepreneur in the Italian 15th century sense of the word -- a mover, shaker.
L645262 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ ...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.
L645261 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Bud, I hate to tell you this but you're a genius!  Darien...lightning has struck! The lightbulb has been invented. Edison, Da Vinci, Einstein are watching...
L645246 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ I'll let you know.
L645245 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.
L645244 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Do you think you're ready?
L645243 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
L645242 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
L645241 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
L645240 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
L645239 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Sure... But your fee... considering you're way over budget, should be negotiable.
L645238 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio.
L645237 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You know, the elevator man couldn't believe I paid $300,000 to have my walls looking like this, he's got them for free in Brooklyn.
L645236 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it. 
L645235 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ ...isn't it perfect!
L645207 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?
L645206 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ I don't.
L645205 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, why stop at that?
L645204 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ ...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...
L645203 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ And what do you want?
L645202 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
L645201 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
L645200 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ So, how did your conference go with Gordon?
L645199 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah, almost...
L645198 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ If I could have anything... this would almost do.
L645178 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ How would I know? I once bet a horse. He went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five.
L645177 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
L645176 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew. What about the Triple Crown?
L645111 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Only if I want something bad enough.
L645110 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ You really do believe in destiny?
L645109 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ So. See you Friday.
L645108 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.
L645107 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
L645106 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Break it.
L645105 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ What if I have a previous engagement?
L645104 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving to the East Side soon. I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon.  but that's just conversation... what about real things? Like dinner. The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo Domingo.
L645103 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
L645102 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Upper West Side.
L645101 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Where is it?
L645100 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.
L645099 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
L645098 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I gather you're a decorator.
L645097 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
L645096 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.
L645095 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
L645094 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You could have a great beach house for that.
L645093 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.
L645092 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.
L645091 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.
L645090 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Stock broker. As in: never have so few done so little for so much. So what do you see in this?
L645089 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Aha. Poet or philosopher?
L645088 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
L645087 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Oh yes, I remember you.
L645086 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.
L645085 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Excuse me.
L645084 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.
L645425 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh Christ!
L645424 +++$+++ u8832 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ He had a heart attack, hon, but he's okay, he's at the hospital...
L645421 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent...
L645420 +++$+++ u8832 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Bud! Where you been the last two days?
L644963 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...how do you know? You wish...
L644962 +++$+++ u8832 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ You were never that innocent sugarpie.
L644961 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Any better and I'd be guilty.
L644960 +++$+++ u8832 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Morning Buddy, you look happy.
L644738 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
L644737 +++$+++ u8832 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ How you doing Buddy?
L645221 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr. Mannheim.
L645220 +++$+++ u8839 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MANNHEIM +++$+++ You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does.
L645031 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ It's a winner Mr. Mannheim, trust me -- buy. 
L645030 +++$+++ u8839 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MANNHEIM +++$+++ Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
L645029 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.
L645028 +++$+++ u8839 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MANNHEIM +++$+++ No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something?  Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets.  You're part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.
L645027 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing.  Anacott Steel.
L644918 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Old values. Buy.
L644917 +++$+++ u8839 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MANNHEIM +++$+++ Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
L644916 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.
L644752 +++$+++ u8839 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MANNHEIM +++$+++ Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it.
L644751 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry...
L645322 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ ...that "scum" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day...
L645321 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground.
L645317 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ No, it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions.  I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. He don't give a damn about Northstar or us ...
L645316 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
L645315 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
L645314 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.
L645295 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?
L645294 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here?
L645456 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything I'm a part of.
L645455 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
L645454 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.
L645453 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
L645452 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.
L645451 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ I can't...and I won't.
L645450 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
L645449 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Because I don't want to see him hurt.
L645448 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
L645447 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
L645446 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?...
L645445 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ You told him about us?
L645444 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ It's over you, Gordon.
L645443 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
L645442 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
L645441 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love?
L645440 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Can't blame me for trying. You look as beautiful as that painting I just bought.
L645439 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
L645438 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine.
L644872 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor.  Interesting. You got a card?
L644871 +++$+++ u8842 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ OLLIE +++$+++ And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.
L644870 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.
L644869 +++$+++ u8842 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ OLLIE +++$+++ ... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions. We got close to half a million shares in the bag.
L644858 +++$+++ u8842 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ OLLIE +++$+++ He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.
L644857 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.  Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red.
L644835 +++$+++ u8842 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ OLLIE +++$+++ You got it, G.G.
L644834 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way!
L645138 +++$+++ u8844 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ WILDMAN +++$+++ Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.
L645137 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.
L645130 +++$+++ u8844 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ WILDMAN +++$+++ I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment.
L645129 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline...
L645128 +++$+++ u8844 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ WILDMAN +++$+++ No. This time I'm in for the long term. This is not a liquidation, Gordon. I'm going to turn it around. You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate, and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock, I could modernize the plant. I'm not the only one who pays here Gordon. We're talking about lives and jobs; three and four generations of steel workers...
L645127 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...
L645126 +++$+++ u8844 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ WILDMAN +++$+++ Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
L645125 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured.
L645506 +++$+++ u8845 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ WILMORE +++$+++ We'll take our chances.  Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko.
L645505 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Listen, you clowns, there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline, if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest!
L645498 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ You guys must know something nobody else knows. If those are my plans, it's the first I've heard of it.
L645497 +++$+++ u8845 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ WILMORE +++$+++ We know what you're up to, Gekko, and let me tell you this from here,  you suck eggs, mister, over my dead body you ain't gonna break up Bluestar.
L645311 +++$+++ u8845 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ WILMORE +++$+++ If you mean what you say, I think we're in the ball park. I'll take it to my people.
L645310 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Cards are on the table. What do you think?
L645306 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.
L645305 +++$+++ u8845 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ WILMORE +++$+++ Are you prepared to put that in writing?
L645301 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Cause I have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. What do you say we cut to the chase. I'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut.
L645300 +++$+++ u8845 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ WILMORE +++$+++ With all due respect, Mr. Gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing?
L646115 +++$+++ u8846 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ CHINA +++$+++ A body.  I mean we're talking major body
L646114 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ What's that?
L646113 +++$+++ u8846 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ CHINA +++$+++ But he still has something Mark hasn't.
L646112 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ But?
L646111 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ So why are you dating Jonathan?
L646110 +++$+++ u8846 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ CHINA +++$+++ Yeah 
L646109 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Yeah, yeah, OK
L646108 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
