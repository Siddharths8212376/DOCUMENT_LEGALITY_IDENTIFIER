L337304 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Ted, you're not listening to me. It's over, finished.
L337303 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ So we've got problems.  Everybody's got problems--that's normal--
L337302 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Look, it's not your fault, okay? It's me.  It's my fault--you just married the wrong person.
L337299 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ I've paid the rent, the Con-Ed and the phone bill, so you don't have to worry about them.
L337298 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Now listen, before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think--
L337297 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning.  They'll be ready on Saturday.
L337296 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
L337295 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
L337294 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
L337293 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ My American Express...My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book--
L337290 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That represents a gross billing in excess of two million--  What?!
L337289 +++$+++ u6220 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ JOANNA +++$+++ Ted, I'm leaving you.
L337288 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I thought you might just like to know that at five-fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the Fire and Ice account by Revlon.
L337762 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Are you firing me, Jim?
L337761 +++$+++ u6222 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ O'CONNOR +++$+++ Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--
L337613 +++$+++ u6222 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ O'CONNOR +++$+++ That's my decision, Ted and that's final.
L337612 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Jim, this is garbage.  This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about.  None of it. You can't--
L337611 +++$+++ u6222 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ O'CONNOR +++$+++ Well, ah...I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.
L337610 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ All right, Jim.  You said I was running this show, right? You said no decisions without my approval, right?  Well what the hell is this? What's going on, Jim?
L337563 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I don't.  Jim, this isn't anything like what we talked about.  It's not even close.
L337562 +++$+++ u6222 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ O'CONNOR +++$+++ Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs...  I think they're kind of interesting.
L337561 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What the hell is this?
L337432 +++$+++ u6222 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ O'CONNOR +++$+++ Hey, Ted.  C'mon in.  I wanna' talk to you.
L337431 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ 'Night, Jim.
L337399 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.
L337398 +++$+++ u6222 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ O'CONNOR +++$+++ Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--
L337397 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I don't know, Jim...
L337396 +++$+++ u6222 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ O'CONNOR +++$+++ Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
L337395 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I don't know, Jim.  This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.
L337394 +++$+++ u6222 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ O'CONNOR +++$+++ But...just in case...I mean, just on the off chance she doesn't. What are you going to do about the kid?
L337393 +++$+++ u6222 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ O'CONNOR +++$+++ She'll be back...
L337392 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
L337391 +++$+++ u6222 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ O'CONNOR +++$+++ Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.
L337390 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Me?  I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
L337389 +++$+++ u6222 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ O'CONNOR +++$+++ Listen, don't let it get you down.  You're going to be fine.
L337388 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You want to know the real kicker?  The real kicker is, for the first time in my life-- the first time--I feel like a loser.
L337387 +++$+++ u6222 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ O'CONNOR +++$+++ Jesus Christ.  That's a real blockbuster.  I always figured you guys had it made.
L337287 +++$+++ u6222 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ O'CONNOR +++$+++ I mean it Ted, you're running this one.
L337286 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Wow!
L337283 +++$+++ u6222 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ O'CONNOR +++$+++ Listen, Ted...I just want to tell you, when old man Schmidt retires next year, I've got a pretty
L337282 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Jim, I've got to go.  I'm already late--
L337281 +++$+++ u6222 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ O'CONNOR +++$+++ Hey, what's the rush?  C'mon, walk me a couple of blocks.
L337268 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I don't think so, Jim.  Maybe I shouldn't have--
L337267 +++$+++ u6222 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ O'CONNOR +++$+++ Ted, will you take it easy? Revlon's not about to drop an account that represents more than two million in gross billing receipts in a small agency like this, without making us sweat.  Now just relax, okay? Everything's gonna be fine.
L337845 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ But it's not a year from now, is it?
L337844 +++$+++ u6223 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ It's a very good job--too good to pass up.  I'll be handling funding for the whole...  Look, I...  ..."like" you a lot.  And you...  ..."like" me, okay?  Maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different...
L337843 +++$+++ u6223 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ I'm going to take it.
L337842 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ And?
L337841 +++$+++ u6223 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ I've been offered a job in Washington with H.E.W.
L337840 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Yeah?
L337839 +++$+++ u6223 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ Kramer...There's something I ought to tell you.
L337838 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.
L337837 +++$+++ u6223 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ Kramer--
L337836 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ But it doesn't work that way. A major decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969--in the case of Haskins vs. Haskins.
L337835 +++$+++ u6223 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ Right.
L337834 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ So, naturally, you assume that since Joanna left, that would be a compelling point against her, right?
L337608 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I don't want to hear another word against him.  Not another word.  He's a wonderful man ...a wonderful man...
L337607 +++$+++ u6223 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
L337606 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ No.  No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen.  He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be--I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...
L337605 +++$+++ u6223 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.
L337604 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ So...what's so terrible about that?
L337603 +++$+++ u6223 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ Murray.
L337602 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ How should I know?
L337600 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I don't believe you.
L337599 +++$+++ u6223 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.
L337598 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I can't.  I've got Billy to take care of.
L337597 +++$+++ u6223 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ You want to know why?  I'll tell you why...  Another scotch and soda for the gentleman.  I'll tell you exactly why. Because you're not his buddy anymore.  Because he can't count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him.
L337595 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What?!?
L337594 +++$+++ u6223 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ O'Connor's out to get you.  He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.
L337593 +++$+++ u6223 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ Kramer...
L337592 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Okay, Phyllis, what's up?
L337547 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Do you?
L337546 +++$+++ u6223 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
L337545 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ And?
L337537 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab...
L337536 +++$+++ u6223 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ Kramer, I've got to go.  I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.
L337535 +++$+++ u6223 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ Yes, I'll have dinner with you.
L337534 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Yes, what?
L337533 +++$+++ u6223 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ Yes.
L337532 +++$+++ u6223 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ Sure.
L337531 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Hiya, Phyllis.  These are the Revlon contracts.  I thought you ought to check them out.
L337495 +++$+++ u6224 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SATURDAY FATHER +++$+++ You've got that look.  My lady and I split two years ago in August and I'm an old pro at this shit.  First thing, stay away from the Children's Zoo.  It's pure hell--if I never see another chicken, I'll be happy.  I'm here, darling.  Don't worry...
L337494 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Three months.  How can you tell?
L337493 +++$+++ u6224 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SATURDAY FATHER +++$+++ Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?
L337492 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
L337491 +++$+++ u6224 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SATURDAY FATHER +++$+++ Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
L337490 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What?
L337526 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Fine.
L337525 +++$+++ u6225 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to meet on Friday.
L337524 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
L337523 +++$+++ u6225 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
L337522 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I know....I know.
L337521 +++$+++ u6225 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Mr. O'Connor called.  There's a meeting with the Revlon people in the board room and you're fifteen minutes late.
L338089 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Don't worry.  I'll get the money.
L338088 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ It's going to cost.
L338087 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'll take my chances.
L338086 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ We can appeal, but I can't guarantee anything.
L338085 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What if I fight it?
L338084 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ Ordered, adjudged and decreed that the petitioner be awarded custody of the minor child, effective Monday the 23rd of January.  That the respondent pay for the maintenance and support of said child, four hundred dollars each month.  That the father shall have the following rights of visitation: every other weekend, one night each week to be mutually agreed upon and one half of the child's vacation period.  That's it.
L338083 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Oh, no..
L338082 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ I can't tell you how sorry I am.
L338081 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I lost him?  I lost him?
L338080 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
L338079 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Oh, Christ!
L338036 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ When Joanna--  my ex-wife--when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage...Well, I guess most of what she said was probably true.  There were a lot of things I didn't understand-- a lot of things I would do different if I could.  Just like I guess there are a lot of things Joanna wishes she could change...But we can't.  Some things, once they are done, can't be undone.  Joanna says she loves Billy.  I believe she does.  So do I.  But the way it was explained to me, that's not the issue.  The only thing that's supposed to matter here is what's best for Billy...When Joanna said why shouldn't a woman have the same ambitions as a man, I suppose she's right.  But by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex?  I guess I've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent:
L338035 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ Mr. Kramer, would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child.
L337995 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ Do you want the kid or don't you?
L337994 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Jesus Christ.  Did you have to be so rough on her?
L337827 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I don't know, John...I mean, to be brutally honest, I'm not so sure what kind of mental shape Joanna's in right now.  Y'know she admitted she was seeing a shrink.
L337826 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ Look, Ted, I don't honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was planning on kidnapping him.
L337751 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Six.
L337750 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ Good.  You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.  How old is the child?
L337749 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Fine.
L337748 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ That's if we win.  If we lose, you could end up having to pay your wife's court costs as well.
L337745 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. Especially where custody is involved.  Got it?
L337744 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Look, she walked out on her own child, right?  That's desertion, right? Mr. Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an open and shut case.
L338029 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ It's beautiful.  It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship.
L338028 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
L338027 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Charley, my husband, and I are ...divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot.  So, I guess we see each three or four times a week.
L338026 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son?
L338025 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
L338024 +++$+++ u6226 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY +++$+++ Mrs. Phillips, how long have you known Ted Kramer?
L337830 +++$+++ u6227 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY'S VOICE +++$+++ Then you don't have a choice. Have Billy at the Seventy- Fifth Street entrance to Central Park, Saturday at ten.
L337829 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ No, but--
L337828 +++$+++ u6227 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY'S VOICE +++$+++ You ever see her talk to the walls?
L337825 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ John, what if she kidnaps him.
L337824 +++$+++ u6227 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY'S VOICE +++$+++ She's the mother.  That means she's within her legal rights.
L337823 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What?!  She wants what?!
L337784 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I don't know.
L337783 +++$+++ u6227 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY'S VOICE +++$+++ How the hell are you going to do that?
L337782 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Don't worry.  I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.
L337781 +++$+++ u6227 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY'S VOICE +++$+++ Any prospects?
L337780 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Yeah.
L337779 +++$+++ u6227 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY'S VOICE +++$+++ Ted?  Are you there?
L337778 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Good Christ, Joanna, just get the hell out of my life.
L337777 +++$+++ u6227 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY'S VOICE +++$+++ Ted, I won't lie to you, we don't have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you're out of work.
L337776 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ John?
L337775 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some- thing I ought to tell you.  My... ah, situation has...changed.  I lost my job.
L337774 +++$+++ u6227 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SHAUNESSY'S VOICE +++$+++ Ted?  They've set the court date. I just heard today...It's...  January sixth.
L337688 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Fuck you.  He's my son.  I'm staying with him.
L337687 +++$+++ u6228 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SURGEON +++$+++ Mr. Kramer, there's--
L337686 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ No.
L337685 +++$+++ u6228 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SURGEON +++$+++ Now, I'd advise you to wait outside.  It'll be eas--
L337683 +++$+++ u6228 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SURGEON +++$+++ Ten.
L337682 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ How many?
L337681 +++$+++ u6228 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SURGEON +++$+++ But I'm going to have to take some stitches.
L337680 +++$+++ u6228 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ SURGEON +++$+++ Your boy is very lucky, Mr. Kramer.  One inch over and it would have caught the eye.
L338095 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Please, Thel...
L338094 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Ted, I just heard...
L338093 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Please go away, Thel...I...I just have to be by myself for a little while...
L338075 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Maybe.  I said maybe.  What I mean is, ah...I don't think it'll really work out, but Charley seems to want it, so...
L338074 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Hey, that's terrific.
L338072 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You and Charley?
L338071 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Ah, Charley and I are...Well, we're thinking about...I mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together.
L338070 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Uh, huh...
L338069 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Ted.
L338068 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Any day.
L338067 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ You heard anything yet?
L337701 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I thought about it a lot and you're the only person I know that I trust with him.  I mean, if anything happened to me, he'd be okay with you.  You're a good mother.
L337700 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Me?!  You want me to take care of Billy?!
L337699 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Thel, listen to me.  If, on the million to one shot that I should--  That anything should happen to me.  Would you take care of Billy?
L337698 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Don't say that!  I don't want to hear you say that!
L337697 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should--
L337696 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ What?
L337695 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Thelma, if I die--
L337694 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I don't mean a little favor. mean a big F favor.
L337693 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Sure.
L337692 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ He's okay...Thel, can I ask you a favor?
L337671 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ I told her you're doing a
L337670 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What d'you tell her?
L337669 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Uh, huh...Yeah...
L337668 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ She ever ask about me?
L337667 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Uh, huh...She said she had a good job, was playing a lot of tennis.  She wanted to know all about Billy.
L337666 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ California?
L337665 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
L337664 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?
L337556 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Look,  I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay?  I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.
L337555 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
L337554 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ No.  I don't think so.
L337553 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
L337552 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Three.  And add some basil.
L337551 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ How many onions does it say to use?
L337550 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
L337549 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You ever think about getting married again?
L337428 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Slow down...Slow down...
L337427 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
L337426 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!
L337423 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'm sure.
L337422 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ You're sure?
L337421 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I understand.
L337420 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ You're on your own, understand?
L337419 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Got it.
L337418 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ I've got enough trouble raising my own kid.  I don't need another one.  Got it?
L337416 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ All right...Okay...But let's get something straight, right now. I mean, I'm sorry about what happened between you and Joanna, but it's not my problem, understand?
L337415 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.
L337414 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.
L337413 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'm gonna keep him, why?
L337412 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
L337411 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
L337410 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ What are you going to do?
