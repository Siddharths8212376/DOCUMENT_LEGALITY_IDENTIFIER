L167306 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Why you going to Algeria?
L167305 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Who the fuck knows?  I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll go to Algeria.
L167304 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Where you gonna go?
L167303 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ I know!
L167302 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ You're really crazy.
L167301 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ That's it.
L167300 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ You're crazy.
L167299 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
L167298 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going?
L167297 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want.
L167296 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ What trip?
L167295 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip...
L167294 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Well...
L167293 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it.
L167292 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank.
L167291 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
L167290 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I'm sorry...
L167289 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that.  Well, I don't know what to say, Leon.  When you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit.  I mean, what am I supposed to say?
L167288 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.  And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  I have no friends left.  No job.  I can't live.  I have to live with people. This death business... I'm sorry!
L167287 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ I don't know what I'm doing.
L167286 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head...
L167285 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit.
L167284 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ What do you mean... what am I talking about?  Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?  I am dying.  Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you?
L167283 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L167282 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?
L167281 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know.  Boy... I'm dying.
L167280 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yeah... I know.
L167279 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble. That is... now I am!
L167278 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yeah.  So how are you?
L167277 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ So... that sure is something.
L167276 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ You can't talk or do anything.  You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now.
L167275 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Yeah...
L167274 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
L167273 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
L167272 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yeah.  It was terrible.
L167271 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up.
L167270 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I'm really shakey.
L167269 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
L167268 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Ooohh....
L167267 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Well.... huh ...
L167266 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you.
L167265 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
L167264 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Well... I'm out of the hospital.
L167263 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ How are you doing?
L167262 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Hello, Sonny.
L167261 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Hello.  Hello, Leon.
L167191 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ You think it over, Leon.
L167190 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I don't know what to say to him.  I can't.
L167189 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
L167188 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I'm afraid.
L167187 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
L167186 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I can't talk to him.
L167185 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ Well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there?
L167184 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.
L167183 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ He needed money?  For the operation for you?
L167182 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with.  I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.
L167181 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ What kind of things, Leon?
L167180 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ He's scared.  It's crazy.  I never met anyone like him.  His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children.  His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable.  I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already!  But he did it.  I don't know why.  I thought it would help me, but it didn't.  I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things.
L167179 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ He's makin' threats in there.
L167178 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ He was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person.
L167177 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ Somebody's got to stop him, Leon.
L167176 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ What good is that?  They couldn't stop him.  And it'd just make him mad.  They don't know him.
L167175 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ You try calling the police?
L167174 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ He won't listen to anybody.  He's been very crazy all summer.  Since June he's been trying to kill me.
L167173 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
L167172 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I can't help it.  I can't stop him from anything.
L167171 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ He's got eight people in there with him.  He's got this kid with him ... they're gonna shoot the people.
L167170 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Oh no!
L167169 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ Well, you got to get hold of yourself.  You got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up.
L167168 +++$+++ u4857 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Oh, God, they shot me with like unreal!
L167167 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ Leon?  Whatsa matter?  They give you a shot down the hospital or what?
L167166 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ He's groggy, Sonny.  Let me get him on his feet and he'll call you back. 
L167165 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ I want to talk to him.
L167164 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ He's all doped up.
L167163 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Is he all right?  Is he all right?
L167154 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ We're bringing in your wife...
L167153 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Yeah?
L167102 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Okay ...
L167101 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
L167100 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
L167099 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ What else?
L167098 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ All right ... I got some hungry people in there ... I want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...
L167097 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ There won't be ... there won't be ... What else do you need?  How else can we help you?
L167096 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...
L167095 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
L167094 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Don't fuck with me ...
L167093 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ Can't land ... you'd kill people ...
L167092 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
L167091 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...
L167090 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Well, what were you doin' back there?
L167089 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ Sonny, your wife's on the way ... We reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got.
L167088 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ You're full of shit ...
L167087 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ Is on its way ... The helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to Kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...
L167086 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Yeah ...
L167085 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
L167084 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
L167083 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ I swear to God I had nothing to do with it ...
L167082 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
L167081 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
L167080 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ You tryin' to fuck me?
L167079 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ They were ...
L167078 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ What the fuck do you want?
L167076 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ Sonny, come on out!
L167075 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ What the hell you doin' back there?
L167030 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ I'll see what they'll do.
L167029 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Nothin' doin'.  I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
L167028 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ The girl hostages.
L167027 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ What do you want?
L167026 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ Okay, what do you give me?
L167025 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ I want to see my wife.  I want you to bring her down here.
L167024 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ Sonny, be reasonable!
L167023 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ I don't know, Sonny.  I don't know if the helicopters can land in here. I'll have to check it out.  I got superiors, unnerstan?  They don't always see eye to eye with me. I'll do what I can.
L167022 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ I want a helicopter to get outa here!  And a jet to take us to...  ... wherever we want to go.  Outa the country, so no little jets.  A big one with a bar and a piano lounge.
L167021 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ It's okay, you got a lot of protection.
L167020 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ He wanted to kill me!
L166921 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Calm down... look at this, look at him...!
L166920 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ Calm down, you're not ...
L166919 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ When I'm bein' fucked, I like to be kissed a lot.  Who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal?  You're a city cop, where's the FBI?  This is a federal offense, I got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me!  You know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me.  Now God damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!
L166918 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ What?
L166916 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ Well, armed, then.  Nobody's been hurt.  Release the hostages, nobody is gonna worry over kidnapping charges, the worst you're gonna get is five years -- you can be out in a year.
L166915 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ ... armed robbery ...
L166914 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ Let Sal come out, take a look. What hope you got?  Quit while you're ahead.  All you got is attempted robbery.
L166912 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ I don't forget about Sal and the boom boom room.  I want you to see this.
L166911 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?
L166910 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ Come on.  I want you to see something.
L166909 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ You got these cops outta here. They're comin' in too close.
L166889 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ So -- you want me to send one out there ... Okay.  I'll see what I can do.
L166888 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ...
L166887 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
L166886 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ Okay, give us the women.
L166885 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
L166884 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
L166883 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
L166882 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny.  I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me.  Some sight ... right?
L166881 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Right -- I'm with you, buddy.
L166880 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ You frisk me.
L166879 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ I frisk you?
L166878 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
L166877 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Call me whatever you want.
L166876 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
L166875 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ One word.  You won't find it in the phone book.
L166874 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ Sonny-boy, one word?
L166873 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Call me Sonny-boy.
L166872 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.
L166871 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ What do you want to know that for?
L166870 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name?
L166869 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Sal.  He's the killer.  We're Vietnam veterans so killing don't mean anything to us, you understand?
L166868 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore?
L166867 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ I got Sal.
L166866 +++$+++ u4859 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MORETTI +++$+++ How many you got in there?
