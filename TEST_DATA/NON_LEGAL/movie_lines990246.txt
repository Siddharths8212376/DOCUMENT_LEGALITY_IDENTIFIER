L478682 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
L478681 +++$+++ u7338 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CRAPS DEALER +++$+++ Those are five hundred dollar chips.
L478680 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What the hell is that?
L478280 +++$+++ u7339 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ DOORMAN #1 +++$+++ Mr. Tan is not to be disturbed by the help.
L478279 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?
L478278 +++$+++ u7339 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ DOORMAN #1 +++$+++ Wait.
L478277 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.
L478276 +++$+++ u7339 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ DOORMAN #1 +++$+++ The band has been playing over an hour.
L478275 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
L478274 +++$+++ u7339 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ DOORMAN #1 +++$+++ Invitation, please.
L478540 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ All right, Kenny.  Thanks.  You're off the hook.  For now.
L478539 +++$+++ u7342 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ I knew it.  The guy's name is Zing.  He works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza.
L478533 +++$+++ u7342 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  I knew something was wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared.  The whole thing.  And they checked out. 100%.
L478532 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What?
L478531 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Yeah.  We already been there.  This is big, Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even tell the difference.
L478530 +++$+++ u7342 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
L478529 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ So tell me what you know.
L478528 +++$+++ u7342 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.
L478527 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ How'd you know?
L478526 +++$+++ u7342 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Is this about the funny money?
L478525 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.
L478515 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I'd like to see you try.
L478514 +++$+++ u7342 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
L478513 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
L478512 +++$+++ u7342 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
L478511 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
L478510 +++$+++ u7342 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ I got my sources.
L478509 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What??  Where'd you hear that?
L478508 +++$+++ u7342 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
L478491 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ The real question is, where are the plates?  If we can find the plates, we can stop the whole operation.
L478490 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
L478489 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
L478484 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.
L478483 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
L478482 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
L478481 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.
L478478 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ They think I'm a crooked customs agent.
L478477 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ So what's your story?
L478476 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Look, I've been working this case for months now...
L478475 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
L478474 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Yeah, that's right.
L478469 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
L478468 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
L478467 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
L478466 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
L478297 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Your friend's ship?  Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason my keys didn't work.
L478296 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
L478295 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
L478294 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
L478293 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
L478292 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
L478291 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
L478290 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ El Capitan?
L478289 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
L478288 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ This is your ship?
L478287 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
L478286 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ I don't think so.
L478285 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
L478284 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
L478283 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
L478783 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
L478782 +++$+++ u7345 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ RICKY TAN +++$+++ Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
L478778 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Lee, you okay?
L478777 +++$+++ u7345 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ RICKY TAN +++$+++ Would you like me to tell you how your father died?
L478321 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.
L478320 +++$+++ u7345 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ RICKY TAN +++$+++ Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
L478209 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.
L478208 +++$+++ u7345 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ RICKY TAN +++$+++ It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
L478207 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
L478206 +++$+++ u7345 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ RICKY TAN +++$+++ I don't think so...
L478205 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.
L478201 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you.  This is the only color they had left.  Now get up!
L478200 +++$+++ u7345 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ RICKY TAN +++$+++ I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?
L478199 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I said get on your feet!
L478198 +++$+++ u7345 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ RICKY TAN +++$+++ I'm busy at the moment.
L478184 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ She is nice.  But I am very tense.  I'm gonna need a lot of massages.  I'll take that one, too.  How you doin', baby? And...that one in pink.  She can do my feet.
L478183 +++$+++ u7340 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ HOSTESS +++$+++ Oh yes, she's very nice.
L478182 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.
L478181 +++$+++ u7340 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ HOSTESS +++$+++ You pick any girl for you and your friend.
L478180 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ No.  It's my first time.
L478179 +++$+++ u7340 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ HOSTESS +++$+++ You get massage from Chinese girl before?
L478178 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.
L478177 +++$+++ u7340 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ HOSTESS +++$+++ You bring American money?
L478176 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ That's right.
L478175 +++$+++ u7340 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ HOSTESS +++$+++ Oh, you American?
L478662 +++$+++ u7347 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ STEVEN REIGN +++$+++ You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house.
L478661 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
L478660 +++$+++ u7347 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ STEVEN REIGN +++$+++ Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
L478659 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...
L478658 +++$+++ u7347 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ STEVEN REIGN +++$+++ Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong.
L478657 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.
L478301 +++$+++ u7347 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ STEVEN REIGN +++$+++ I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.
L478300 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?
L478820 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Amen to that, brother.
L478819 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I could use a little vacation.
L478818 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Some Kung-Pao?
L478817 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ A little Mu-shu.
L478816 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ The Plaza Hotel?
L478815 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ First class.
L478814 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ New York City?
L478813 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden.  See the Knicks play.
L478812 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up.  There must be something you want.
L478811 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ This money is evidence.
L478810 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.
L478809 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ It's okay, I got lots more.
L478808 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ No, Carter.  I can't take this.
L478807 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
L478806 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ What is this?
L478804 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ It's okay.  I can finally let it go.
L478803 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I can't take this.
L478801 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You take care of yourself, Lee.
L478800 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
L478799 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
L478798 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Yes.
L478797 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ That your gate down there?
L478796 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.
L478795 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though.  Walking away, never looking back.
L478791 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ No problem.
L478790 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ We made it, man.
L478781 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ It's worth it to me.
L478780 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it, man.  He's making you do this.
L478751 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Just GO!
L478750 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Carter...
L478749 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You go after Ricky.  I got this.
L478747 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ We have to get to the Penthouse.
L478746 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What?!?!
L478745 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Ricky Tan is alive.
L478744 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!
L478743 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ No you didn't!
L478742 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I did!
L478741 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?
L478736 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ MMMMMM!!!!
L478735 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Lee!
L478677 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I'll give it my best shot.
L478676 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
L478675 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene.  When security comes over, you make your move.
L478674 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Wait a second.  There's guards all over the place.  You'll need a distraction.
L478673 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ No.  I'm going to find out.
L478672 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again!
L478671 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ It was Isabella.  She says the plates are in the soft count room.
L478670 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
L478669 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Dancing?
L478668 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Lee, what the hell are you doing?
L478643 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Wait here.  I'll handle this.
L478642 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Carter...here comes the rich white man.
L478636 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy. The man has the biggest tits in Asia.
L478635 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
L478634 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.
L478629 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing us.
L478628 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here.  Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case.
L478623 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Follow me my Asian brother.
L478622 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ What is Mac out?
L478621 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
L478620 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Let's go.
L478619 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.
L478618 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Red Dragon.
L478617 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Lee.  I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.
L478616 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Vegas...
L478614 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.
L478613 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
L478612 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
L478611 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ You've been a good friend, James Carter.
L478610 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ End of the line.
L478609 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ We're slowing down.  This must be it.
L478607 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Now that I believe.
L478606 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
L478605 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ No Chinese man discovered electricity.
L478604 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ A Chinese man discovered electricity.
L478603 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
L478602 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Who's Benjamin?
L478601 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Hello, Benjamin.
L478600 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I'll remember that next time I'm fighting a box.
L478599 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
L478598 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Very nice.
L478595 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.
L478594 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
L478593 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
L478592 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
L478591 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
L478590 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Forget it.  It doesn't matter.
L478589 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Are you serious?
L478588 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
L478587 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
L478586 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
L478585 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Steamed dumplings?
L478584 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ No kung pao chicken.  Never.
L478583 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What about a little king pao chicken?
L478582 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ No mu-shu.
L478581 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
L478580 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
L478579 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ How was the sex?
L478578 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Mind your own business.
L478577 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
L478576 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ No.
L478575 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
L478574 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Fine by me.
L478573 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I think we should stop talking.
L478572 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
L478571 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ What's a Chinese heaven?
L478570 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
