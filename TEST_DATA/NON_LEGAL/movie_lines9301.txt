L421418 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Cox!  Fire him.
L421417 +++$+++ u2326 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HAIG +++$+++ Who?
L421402 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys.  I'll take my chances with the Senate.
L421401 +++$+++ u2326 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HAIG +++$+++ About a dozen.
L421393 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ For what?!
L421392 +++$+++ u2326 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HAIG +++$+++ Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
L421391 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Who the fuck does Cox think he is?  I never made a dime from public office!  I'm honest.  My dad died broke.  You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment! They got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about Watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ...
L421390 +++$+++ u2326 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HAIG +++$+++ Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?
L421389 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
L421388 +++$+++ u2326 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HAIG +++$+++ This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
L421387 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ It's the President's personal property!  I will never give up my tapes to a bunch of Kennedy-loving Harvard Democrat cocksuckers!
L420785 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ These State Department jerks, Bill, don't understand; you got to electrify people with bold moves.  Bold moves make history, like Teddy Roosevelt -- "T.R." -- rushing up San Juan Hill.  Small event but dramatic.  People took notice.
L420784 +++$+++ u2326 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HAIG +++$+++ That's what they're doing.
L420783 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Exactly!  We've got to take the war to them.  Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts.  More assassinations, more killings.  Right, Al?
L420155 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ 'Night, Al.
L420154 +++$+++ u2326 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HAIG +++$+++ I don't have a pistol.
L420153 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
L420152 +++$+++ u2326 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HAIG +++$+++ You're all set, sir.  Just push this button.  Good night, Mr. President.
L420151 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Damn right.  And there's still a helluva lotta people out there who wanna believe ... That's the point, isn't it?  They wanna believe in the President.
L420150 +++$+++ u2326 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HAIG +++$+++ No, sir, you did not.
L420148 +++$+++ u2326 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HAIG +++$+++ You've never been a greater example to the country than you are now, sir, but ... but you need to get out more, sir, and talk to the people.  No one I know feels ... close to you.
L420147 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ There's no secrets here, Al.
L420146 +++$+++ u2326 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HAIG +++$+++ May I say something, Mr. President?
L420145 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Not like the others -- Dean, McCord, the rest ... We never got our side of the story out, Al.  People've forgotten.  I mean: "Fuck you, Mr. President, fuck you Tricia, fuck you Julie!" and all that shit, just words, but what violence!  The tear gassing, the riots, burning the draft cards, Black Panthers -- we fixed it, Al, and they hate me for it -- the double dealing bastards.  They lionize that traitor, Ellsberg, for stealing secrets, but they jump all over me 'cause it's Nixon.  ... They've always hated Nixon.
L420144 +++$+++ u2326 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HAIG +++$+++ At least Mitchell stood up to it.
L420143 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ I trusted Mitchell.  It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
L420142 +++$+++ u2326 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HAIG +++$+++ Mr. Hoover was a realist.
L420141 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ ... Y'know Al, if Hoover was alive none of this would've happened.  He would've protected the President.
L420140 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ ... go on.
L420139 +++$+++ u2326 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HAIG +++$+++ Sorry ...
L420134 +++$+++ u2326 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HAIG +++$+++ It's marked.  Also there's June twenty third.  And this year -- March twenty first.  Those are the ones ...
L420133 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ This is June twentieth?
L421326 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Sir ... six bodies.
L421325 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ ... There can be no whitewash at the White House ... two wrongs do not make a right.  I love America.  God bless America and God bless each and every one of you.
L421324 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ No ...
L421323 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ More light, chief?
L421240 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ For God's sake, when does this end?!
L421239 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Helms wants Iran or there might be problems.  All of his old CIA buddies are over there making a fortune off the Shah.
L421236 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Townsend gave us 300 grand.  Belgium's not worth more than 100, 150 ...
L421235 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
L421234 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ I promised Iran to Townsend.
L421233 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ He'll give us the documents.  But I think he should be offered the ambassadorship to Iran.  Then he'll go without a whimper.
L421232 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ What about the documents he promised?
L421231 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ ... I was wondering what's such dynamite in this Bay of Pigs story?  ... although it was clearly effective, because all of a sudden it was no problem for Helms to go to the FBI and try to put a lid on Watergate.
L421226 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ When I met with him, he said ...
L421225 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ How?
L421224 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ We could leverage Helms.
L421223 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ It's Helms -- it's got to be.
L421222 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing.  It's out of control ...  You might burden just me with this in the future.
L421217 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
L421216 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again.
L421202 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ ... worrying whether someone said something "nice" about them.  All short-term, frivolous bullshit; Ben Bradlee worrying about Teddy Kennedy liking him ...
L421201 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ ... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
L421200 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ You know why they're turning on me? They're not serious about power, that's why.  They're playing with power.  They're forgetting the national interest.  In the old days, people knew how to hold power, how to set limits.  They wouldn't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary. All they care about now are their egos, looking good at cocktail parties ...
L421199 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Why would they?!  Who the hell's Sulzberger anyway?  Their parents are gold traders from Eastern Europe. They buy things.  They come to Jew York City and they buy up things.  One of the things they buy is the New York Times.  And you know what?  Be proud because they'll never trust you, sir, because we speak for the average American.
L421198 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America!
L421197 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Because they're not Americans.
L421174 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ We ought to fire his whining ass. Right now when he's on top.  You know what -- it'll set the right example for the rest of this administration.
L421173 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ My God, my God!  He talked to the New York Times?
L421172 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ So that explains his press notices. Working both sides of the fence: Jewboy Henry, always trying to get his Nobel Prize, get laid ...
L421166 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ This could be it ... this could be it. Four long years ...
L421165 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Congratulations, boss.  A great victory!  The madman theory wasn't so crazy after all.
L421163 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ The presidency won't protect us, Bob. We're beyond politics now ...
L421162 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Sir?
L421161 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ ... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
L421160 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ I believe you're right, boss.
L421159 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ You know, they all miss the point. Probably our biggest achievement as an administration, when it's all said and done, isn't China or Russia.  It's pulling out of Vietnam without a right wing revolt.
L421149 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Let him finish, Bob.
L421148 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.
L421120 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
L421119 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
L421118 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry.  It's killing us with the rednecks.
L421117 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ The Jews aren't the middle, Henry. They're the far left.
L421112 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Wait till the Mai-tais wear off.
L421111 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ And his staff.  Come on, the copy they were filing from China was great.
L421031 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ ... "The Beast."  A nineteen-year-old kid.  She understands the nature of "the Beast."  She called it a wild animal.
L421030 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Sir?
L421029 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand.  The CIA, the Mafia, the Wall Street bastards ...
L421028 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ What?
L421027 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ She got it, Bob.  A nineteen-year-old college kid ...
L421026 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Don't forget, the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your Maker ...  Don't forget to be on God's side.
L421025 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ We really must go, Mr. President.
L421013 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ It's okay, Bob, we're just rapping, my friends and I.  We actually agree on a lot of things ...
L421012 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Mr. President!
L420873 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Yeah, we've got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit.  That's top priority.
L420872 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ But, hell, this is nothing compared to Venezuela.  When I was Vice President, Ike sent me down there like a blocking back.  They threw rocks, broke out our windows, almost overturned the car. Read Six Crises, Bob.  Boy, Pat was brave!
L420867 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ It's the parents' fault really.
L420866 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
L420865 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars, too many color TVs ...
L420864 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
L420863 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Get that little fucker!  Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless.
L420862 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Run 'em over.
L420861 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
L420860 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ ... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?
L420845 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ I tell you, the soldiers were provoked.  Now stop this pussyfooting around.  Dead kids!  How the hell did we ever give the Democrats a weapon like this?  I mean, if Cambodia doesn't work, we'll bomb Hanoi if we have to.
L420844 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ ... never complain, never explain, John ...
L420831 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ These kids are being manipulated by the Communists.  Like Chambers and Hiss.
L420830 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Sir?
L420829 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Money.  Follow the money.
L420828 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Well, one way or the other, Kent State is not good.  We have to get out in front of this thing.  The PR is going to murder us.
L420745 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ They had us bugged.  Christ, he had everybody bugged.  Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me.  That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.
L420744 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?
L420742 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ I didn't want him to get the credit. He said I'd stabbed him in the back. Called me a two-bit grocery clerk from Whittier.
L420741 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ You never told him?
L420740 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ ... he'd just found out about Track 2.
L420739 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Because he didn't even know about it. The CIA never told him, they just kept it going.  It was like ... it had a life of its own.  Like ... a kind of "beast" that doesn't even know it exists.  It just eats people when it doesn't need 'em anymore.  Two days after the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy called me in.  He reamed my ass ...
L420738 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Alright.  But why, if Kennedy is so clean in all this, didn't he cancel Track 2?
L420737 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Because ... because Dick Helms knows too much ... If anyone in this country knows more than I do, it's Hoover and Helms!  You don't fuck with Dick Helms!  Period.
L420736 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ So?  You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?
L420735 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ And not just Hunt.  Frank Sturgis, all those Cubans.  All of them in the Watergate.  They were involved in Track 2 in Cuba.  Hunt reported to my military aide. But I met with him several times as Vice President.  That's what worries the shit out of me.  I don't know how much Hunt knows.  Or the Cubans.
L420734 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Jesus!
L420733 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ He didn't veto it.  I ran the White House side.  The mob contact was Johnny Roselli.  One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt.
L420732 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Before?!  Eisenhower approved that?
L420731 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ The first assassination attempt was in '60, just before the election.
L420730 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability, there's a Track 2.  In Cuba, Track 1 was the Bay of Pigs invasion.  Track 2 ... it was our idea.  We felt the invasion wouldn't work unless we got rid of Castro.  So we asked ourselves -- who else wants Castro dead?  The Mafia, the money people.   So we put together Track 2 ...
L420729 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ I don't understand.  Track 2's Chile?
L420728 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Yeah, but Roselli wasn't just any gangster.  He was the gangster who set up Track 2 in Cuba.
L420727 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
L420726 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ He wasn't protecting me.  He was putting me on notice.
L420644 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ I, unlike Senator Kennedy, have a plan to end the war.  But not for peace at any price, but peace with honor!
L420643 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Cue the crowd.  Go to the woman's group.  Get the bald guy, he's great ...
L420440 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ No!
L420439 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Dick, you don't have to make a statement.  Herb covered it for you.
L420438 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Where are they?
L420343 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ The bastard!  If I'd called his shot on Cuba I would've won.  He made me look soft.
L420342 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Meanwhile, what happens to the country?
L420330 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ ... an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to become involved in Latin America.  We would lose all our friends in Latin America.
L420329 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.
L420328 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ I think ... I think ... that's the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that ... helping the Cuban exiles who oppose Castro would, uh ... not only be a violation of international law, it would be ...
L420314 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ He wouldn't do the makeup.  Said it was for queers.
L420313 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ ... When we consider the lineup of the world, we find there are 590 million people on our side, 800 million on the Communist side, and 600 million who are neutral.  The odds are 5 to 3 against us ...
L420301 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Yes, sir.  I'll talk to Helms, and, uh ... what's our press position on this Watergate thing?  What do I tell Ziegler to tell them?
L420300 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.
L420299 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ I'll talk to Helms.  Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.
L420298 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob.  We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own.  Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.
L420297 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Sir?
L420296 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ I suppose you thought the Presidency was above this sort of thing.
L420295 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Because the President says it is.  My job is to protect this country from its enemies, and its enemies are inside the walls.
L420294 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ How is this national security?
L420293 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
L420292 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
L420291 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Christ, you're right -- Gray makes Jerry Ford look like Mozart.  Just have Helms call him.  Helms can scare anybody.
L420290 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
L420289 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
L420288 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
L420287 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Just do what I say, Bob.
L420286 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ The Bay of Pigs? ... That was Kennedy's screw-up.  How does that threaten us?
L420285 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period!
L420284 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ All right.
L420283 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ We've got to turn off the FBI.  You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President.  Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what I'm talking about.
L420282 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ That's right, and it's more a problem for Ehrlichman.  He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA ID's, but ... what else does Hunt have on us?
L420281 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
L420280 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ...
L420279 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Bob, did I approve the Ellsberg thing? You know, I'm glad we tape all these conversations because ... I never approved that break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist.  Or maybe I approved it after the fact?  Someday we've got to start transcribing the tapes.
L420277 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old.  And for God's sake, keep Colson out.  It's time to baptize our young counsel.  That means Dean can never talk about it.  Attorney-client privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean -- you stay close on this.
L420276 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner?
L420270 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ We'll work on it.  I say we cut ourselves loose from these clowns and that's all there is to it.
L420269 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ "National security priority restricted and controlled secret."
L420266 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ "National Priority."
L420265 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ How about a COMINT classification?  We put it on the Huston plan.  Even the designation is classified.
L420264 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ "Security" is not strong enough.
L420263 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."
L420262 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Silence!
L420261 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ But what are we paying him for?
L420253 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ What do you mean, sir?
L420252 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Howard Hunt? ... Jesus Christ, you open up that scab ... and you uncover a lot of pus.
L420229 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
L420228 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Well, why not?
L420201 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ We were working on China.
L420200 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Fucking hell.
L420199 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke.  They went in to get his psychiatric records.
L420198 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ I did?
L420197 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Yes, you approved it, sir.
L420196 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ I had nothing to do with that.  Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing?
L420195 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Definitely.  Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.
L420194 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ On the list of horribles, I know what he is.  And I know what he tracks back to.  You say he was involved in the Plumbers?
L420191 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Howard Hunt is working for the White House?  No shit!  This is goddamn Disneyland!  Since when?
L420190 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ He works for Colson.  He used him on the Pentagon Papers.  We're trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a White House consultant.  After the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his White House safe.
L420181 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Apparently he was using some campaign cash that was laundered for us through Mexico.  The FBI's onto it.  We could have a problem with that.
L420180 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ What's Liddy got?
L420179 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.
L420178 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ That fruitcake!  What about him?
L420177 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...
L420163 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Contributions!  It was a legal contribution.  Who the hell authorized this?  Colson?
L420162 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
L420161 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Their fourth!
L420160 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.
L420159 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ But O'Brien doesn't even use that office.  The Democrats've moved to Miami.  There's nothing there!
L420158 +++$+++ u2327 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HALDEMAN +++$+++ Evidently to install bugs and photograph documents.
L420157 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ They did what?!  I don't understand. Why'd they go into O'Brien's office in the first place?
L420767 +++$+++ u2328 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Thou must find thy peace at the center, Richard.  Strength in this life.  Happiness in the next.
L420766 +++$+++ u2342 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ What about happiness, Mother?
L420765 +++$+++ u2328 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...
L420764 +++$+++ u2342 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Did he have to die for me to get it?!
L420763 +++$+++ u2328 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.
L420762 +++$+++ u2328 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Thou must.
L420761 +++$+++ u2342 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ I can't ...
L420390 +++$+++ u2342 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Is it my turn?
L420389 +++$+++ u2328 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.
L420386 +++$+++ u2342 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Mother, think of me always as your faithful dog ...
