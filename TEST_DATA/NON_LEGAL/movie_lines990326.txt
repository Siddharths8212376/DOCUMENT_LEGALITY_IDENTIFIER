L526471 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior.
L526470 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ I bet you didn't know that you and Junior have something in common, Theo: Junior can't bowl anymore either. Isn't that right Junior? Kastle SLAMS the ketchup bottle down on Junior's right hand. The table settings jump from the shock. Junior sits impassively, his face a blank.
L526467 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
L526466 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.
L526296 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ Four or five years when a girl like that's bowling on the pro tour for Team Kastle, she'll pay a handsome profit on my investment.
L526295 +++$+++ u7799 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ MRS. JACKSON +++$+++ She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
L526294 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ I get them while they're young. Builds loyalty.
L526291 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ You keep that up Carmelita and one day you'll be a champion just like Mr. Skinner here. What do you think, Theo? Think Carmelita's got the stuff?
L526290 +++$+++ u7799 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ MRS. JACKSON +++$+++ 132, 154.
L526289 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
L526288 +++$+++ u7799 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ MRS. JACKSON +++$+++ Hello, Mr.Kastle.
L526700 +++$+++ u7803 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Yippy!
L526699 +++$+++ u7797 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!
L526698 +++$+++ u7803 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Strokin'. Here goes nothin'.
L526697 +++$+++ u7797 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
L526696 +++$+++ u7803 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Like this?
L526695 +++$+++ u7797 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Now swing it out a little to the right...
L526694 +++$+++ u7803 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Yeah.
L526693 +++$+++ u7797 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Line up where you want it.
L526692 +++$+++ u7803 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Grasp firmly. Then what?
L526691 +++$+++ u7797 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
L526690 +++$+++ u7803 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ I just hold it loosely with both hands?
L526131 +++$+++ u7798 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ MILLIE +++$+++ The Peter Pan.
L526130 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Where can I find him?
L526129 +++$+++ u7798 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ MILLIE +++$+++ Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.
L526128 +++$+++ u7798 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ MILLIE +++$+++ He's no father to you.
L526127 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ He's my father, Millie.
L526126 +++$+++ u7798 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ MILLIE +++$+++ Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
L526125 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
L526124 +++$+++ u7798 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ MILLIE +++$+++ This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.
L526123 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
L526122 +++$+++ u7798 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ MILLIE +++$+++ He's not here.
L526066 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ They suspended me.
L526065 +++$+++ u7798 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ MILLIE +++$+++ Get that outta your mouth!
L526051 +++$+++ u7798 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ MILLIE +++$+++ I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be?
L526050 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm a bowler.
L526049 +++$+++ u7798 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ MILLIE +++$+++ Who wants to know?  Zeus!
L526048 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
L526736 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Can you change something this big?
L526735 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.
L526734 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Lips still for sale?
L526733 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I am a professional man.
L526732 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Very professional.
L526680 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Suck my dick!
L526679 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Sez you!
L526678 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.
L526677 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
L526676 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
L526675 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Fuck plan C!
L526674 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ What about plan C?
L526673 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ My word is good, and it'll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you?
L526672 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word?
L526671 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You're really pissing me off.
L526670 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.
L526669 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh?
L526657 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ SSHHEEIILLAAA!
L526656 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
L526655 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
L526654 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
L526653 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
L526652 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Theo, Buzz is dead.
L526642 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C. Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy hands sliding over each others' sweaty skin.
L526641 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Say something, Theo. Give me something. A doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into Sheila's eyes.
L526635 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ At least I'll die smiling.
L526634 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ You don't get two chances with Junior.
L526633 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
L526632 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
L526631 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
L526630 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Why did you come back?
L526592 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.
L526591 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Can I come with you?
L526590 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
L526589 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Where are you going?
L526588 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I didn't stop to take his pulse.
L526587 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Are you sure he's dead?
L526586 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You should.
L526585 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ I feel sick.
L526584 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ He's dead Sheila.
L526583 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
L526582 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?
L526581 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Tell me what happened Theo.
L526580 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ How do you get this thing down?
L526579 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Did you - kill him?
L526578 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.
L526577 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ We would have sooner or later.
L526576 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
L526575 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ I told him you were my boyfriend.
L526574 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
L526573 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ It?
L526572 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You told Junior that we did it.
L526547 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'll be at the bridge.
L526546 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
L526545 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.
L526544 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ He's my father.
L526543 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
L526542 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ It's Junior, isn't it.
L526541 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
L526540 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
L526539 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
L526538 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Why not?
L526537 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ I can't tell you, Theo.
L526536 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
L526535 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
L526534 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You got any broken bones?
L526533 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
L526532 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Too late for what, Sheila?
L526531 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Nothing.
L526530 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history.  Too late for what?
L526529 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
L526528 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Zip.
L526527 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
L526526 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Why should I help that old fuck.
L526525 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
L526524 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Nope, I couldn't care less.
L526523 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it?
L526463 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ ...lane six. Yes.
L526462 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Then it's true, isn't it? About...
L526455 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What about the guy he put in the body cast?
L526454 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ You're here.
L526453 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What are you going to do about your brother?
L526452 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
L526451 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
L526450 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I could let them go for ten.
L526449 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Come on, bargain with me.
L526448 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ More than you could afford.
L526447 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ How much would you charge me for the lips?
L526446 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
L526445 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
L526444 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
L526443 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
L526442 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ So why do you stay?
L526441 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ My mom told me not to stay in this town.
L526440 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
L526439 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Do you talk with your mom?
L526438 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Really? I kinda like it.
L526437 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.
L526387 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Plan C...  ...is me.
L526386 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What's plan C?
L526385 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Come on Theo, what about plan C?
L526384 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Sheila, please.
L526383 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ What? Be my body guard?  Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.
L526382 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
L526381 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
L526380 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Nothing.
L526379 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
L526378 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ He said he'd sponsor me.
L526377 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
L526376 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Plan B is your dad.
L526375 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ What's plan B?
L526374 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Well, that was plan A.
L526373 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
L526372 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
L526371 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Why were you suspended?
L526370 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ No, I'm fascinated.
L526369 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.
L526368 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
L526367 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?
L526365 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ We'll get into that later.
L526364 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Do I want you?
L526363 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ So, what about you?
L526362 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Unfortunately what he wants is you.
L526361 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
L526360 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
L526359 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ No. Not at the present.
L526358 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ No. Do You?
L526357 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Do you have a boyfriend?
L526356 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Not while I'm in training.
L526355 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Do you have a girlfriend?
L526354 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'd rather you didn't.
L526353 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Can I ask you something personal?
L526352 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
L526351 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.
L526350 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ No, not at all.
L526349 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Mind if I cut in?
