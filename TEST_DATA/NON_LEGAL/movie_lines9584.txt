L69562 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
L69533 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Actually, it's a lot like that.
L69532 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Okay, go ahead.  Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big.  I mean, it's not like you can just kill me.
L69531 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle.  And Interest Number One, is <u>moi</u>.
L69530 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ It's our secret.  Honest.  How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
L69529 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Too good?
L69528 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ And a very, very good one.
L69527 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
L69526 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ ... Where did curiosity get the cat?
L69524 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ And who ... would you say this <u>to</u>?
L69523 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Big giant <u>capacitor</u>.  And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be --  -- <u>sucking</u> power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of?  Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say.
L69522 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
L69521 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
L69520 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
L69519 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Working late?  I'm touched.
L73169 +++$+++ u3920 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ The boys need help.
L73168 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ In spirit only, I'm afraid.
L73167 +++$+++ u3920 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Uncle Alfred?
L73103 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ It is the hearts of two good men whom I have had the honor of calling son.  Take it, child.  But I implore you, never open it.  You look so like your mother.
L73102 +++$+++ u3920 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ What is it?
L73101 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Find my brother Wilfred.  Give him This.  I have duties he must fulfill in my stead.  Only family can be trusted.
L73099 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know.  I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.
L73098 +++$+++ u3920 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
L73097 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Too late for what, dear child?
L73096 +++$+++ u3920 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I was too late.
L72785 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ As I've missed you.  Sleep well, child.
L72784 +++$+++ u3920 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
L72783 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success.  As one grows older, one yearns for family.
L72782 +++$+++ u3920 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I guess they don't have fax machines on elephants.
L72781 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ You came to tuck me in.  That's quite a switch.  I am looking for my brother, Wilfred. He is first butler to the Maharajah of Mirajanpore.  But Mirajanpore is a floating court, it travels across India, so Wilfred can be rather difficult to find.
L72780 +++$+++ u3920 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I'm sorry, Uncle, I came to tuck you in.  And...
L72765 +++$+++ u3920 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Oh no, those things frighten me.
L72764 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ You certainly will not.
L72753 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Eventually she married a young physician.
L72752 +++$+++ u3920 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -
L72751 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Joanna and I were in love in London. But when I realized our age difference was too extreme -
L72748 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Ten years.  Barbara isn't really me niece, sir. She's Joanna Clark's daughter.
L72747 +++$+++ u3920 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ How long has it been, Uncle Alfred?
L73298 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Rather disappointed at how poorly I taught you proper housekeeping.  And quite well, it seems.  Thanks to you, son.  Thanks to you all.
L73297 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Alfred, are you...?
L73147 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.
L73146 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ What is it?
L73143 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Passion.  Of course.  Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball.
L73142 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
L73141 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Pheromones?
L73140 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Advanced botany.  DNA splicing. Recombinant animal plant patterns. Pheromone extractions.
L73138 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Coming on line now, sir.
L73137 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
L73136 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Specify, please.
L73135 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ First Ivy had an intoxicating effect on both Dick and me.  Tonight my feelings spread to someone else.
L73134 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ That, sir, does not compute.
L73133 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Women.
L73132 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ What seems to be the problem?
L73131 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ It's good to see you.
L73129 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Right here, sir.
L73128 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Alfred, old friend, I could use your help right now.
L73083 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Remember this.  And remember it always.  I'm proud of you.  And I love you too, son.
L73082 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I love you, old man.
L73081 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Everyone dies, Master Bruce.  There's no defeat in that.  Victory comes in fighting for what we know is right while we still live.
L73080 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I've spent my whole life trying to beat back death.  What good are all my heroics now if I can't save you?
L73005 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Yes?
L73004 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Alfred, if I've never told you...I just want to say...
L73003 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Not all heroes wear masks.
L73002 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
L73001 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
L73000 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ I've seen the best doctors--! A gentleman does not discuss his health.  It's not civilized.  I hope I've taught you at least that much, young man.
L72999 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
L72998 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ I am as well as can be expected.
L72899 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ No, my boy.  I'm afraid none of us can.
L72898 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ But I can't can I?
L72897 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Why, yes, actually.  Death and chance stole your parents.  But rather than become a victim, you have done everything in your power to control the fates.  For what is Batman if not an effort to master the chaos that sweeps our world, an attempt to control death itself.
L72896 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Alfred, am I pigheaded?  Is it always my way or the highway?
L72895 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Is there something wrong, sir?
L72894 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Thanks.
L72893 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Congratulations on your apprehension of Mr. Freeze.  Batman monopolized the evening news.
L72771 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
L72770 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
L72767 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ There's a lovely inn just down --
L72766 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
L72757 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
L72756 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ You have?
L72740 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ No apology necessary.  That's the first time in thirty years.
L72739 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ I must have dozed off.  My sincerest apologies, sir.
L72697 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Despite all your talents, you are still a novice in the ways of family. Dick follows the same ends as you but gets there by his own course.  You must learn to trust him.  For that is the nature of family.
L72696 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
L72695 +++$+++ u3919 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
L72694 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ He's over-eager, impulsive.  I can't trust him not to get hurt.
L73303 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ You are going back to school.
L73302 +++$+++ u3920 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
L73301 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.
L72761 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I recognized the accent.
L72760 +++$+++ u3920 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
L72759 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Oxbridge Academy?
L72758 +++$+++ u3920 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I'm on break from-
L72963 +++$+++ u3920 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Happy.  You honestly don't know, do you? You can't even see what's in front of your own eyes.
L72962 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Alfred's happy here.
L72961 +++$+++ u3920 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
L72960 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Alfred and Bruce are like family.
L72959 +++$+++ u3920 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
L72958 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L72957 +++$+++ u3920 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Alfred has supported me my whole life.  Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
L72956 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Just don't tell me you're hoping to run away and join the circus.
L72955 +++$+++ u3920 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
L72954 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ You'd be surprised.
L72953 +++$+++ u3920 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.
L72951 +++$+++ u3920 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I guess, the truth is I'm just not comfortable with the idle rich.  Even when they try to act like heroes.
L72950 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Hey, what's your problem?
L72949 +++$+++ u3920 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
L72948 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Keep it.
L72947 +++$+++ u3920 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
L72946 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.
L72945 +++$+++ u3920 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I could have made it, you know.  I didn't need your help.
L72755 +++$+++ u3920 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ My parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago.  Alfred has been supporting me ever since.
L72754 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Al's main squeeze.  Is she here?  I'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue, right?
L72743 +++$+++ u3920 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
L72742 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Please be looking for me.
L73250 +++$+++ u3921 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATGIRL +++$+++ Those targeting mirrors are frozen. The sun beam won't work.
L73249 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Damn?  Damn is not good.
L73248 +++$+++ u3921 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATGIRL +++$+++ It'll take the satellites about a minute to re-align, but...damn!
L73237 +++$+++ u3921 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATGIRL +++$+++ I don't know.  It just feels right.
L73236 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ What exactly are you doing?
L73235 +++$+++ u3921 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATGIRL +++$+++ Pow!  What!  Kazow!
L73234 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Be ready for anything.
L73233 +++$+++ u3921 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATGIRL +++$+++ I'm afraid to ask.
L73232 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Crimefighter's rule number two.
L73228 +++$+++ u3921 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATGIRL +++$+++ Why?
L73227 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
L73226 +++$+++ u3921 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATGIRL +++$+++ This is easy.
L73223 +++$+++ u3921 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATGIRL +++$+++ Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.
L73222 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Youwsa!  Nothing but air.
L73215 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Divide and conquer.
L73214 +++$+++ u3921 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATGIRL +++$+++ Alpha.  Got it.  What the hell is attack plan Alpha?
L73285 +++$+++ u3922 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ I didn't kill your wife.
L73284 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ Go on, kill me too.  Just as you killed my wife.
L73269 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ I think not.  There'll be no hot time in this old town tonight.  You'll get a charge out of this.
L73268 +++$+++ u3922 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ You're loosing your cool
L73225 +++$+++ u3922 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ We have eleven minutes to stop Freeze And thaw the city.
L73224 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ Mr. Bane, I'll finish off the city. You, as they say in showbiz, are on.  Take the boys and kill the kids. But bring me the Bat.
L72627 +++$+++ u3922 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ Freeze, you're mad.  This capsule will slaughter thousands.
L72626 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ After you have frozen, your icy tomb will plummet back to Gotham.
L72623 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ I hate being lectured.
L72622 +++$+++ u3922 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ You were a great scientist once. Don't squander your genius on evil.
L73278 +++$+++ u3922 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ Don't make me kill you in front of the girl.
L73277 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Winded, old timer?
L73247 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ From the other side of the equator-
L73246 +++$+++ u3922 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ If we could relay the sunlight-
L73239 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Maybe he melted.
L73238 +++$+++ u3922 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ No sign of the snowman.
L73206 +++$+++ u3922 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ Kill her later.  We've got work to do.
L73205 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I guess we'll just have to kill her.
L73204 +++$+++ u3922 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ She knows who we are.
L73203 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ We gotta get those locks changed.
L73055 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?!
L73054 +++$+++ u3922 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
L73053 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L73052 +++$+++ u3922 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.
L73031 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Just the beast.
L73030 +++$+++ u3922 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ No beauty...
L73029 +++$+++ u3922 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ No.  Her case is too advanced.  But maybe, someday, with more research-
L73028 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Can he save her?
L73027 +++$+++ u3922 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ She's still alive.  He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome.  He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease.
L73026 +++$+++ u3922 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ Open Sesame...Chicken.
L73025 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ How did you...?
L73024 +++$+++ u3922 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ Definitely.
L73023 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Umm-hmmmm.
L73022 +++$+++ u3922 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ Me too.  Great stems, though.
L73021 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I'm totally over her.  Positively.
L73020 +++$+++ u3922 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
L73019 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
L73018 +++$+++ u3922 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ I know.  The feeling just vanished.
L73017 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then...
L72878 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I can make it.
L72877 +++$+++ u3922 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ Pull back.  You can't make the jump.
L72857 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I'll borrow it from you.  Four million - -
L72856 +++$+++ u3922 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ You don't have two million.  Three million - -
L72834 +++$+++ u3922 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ He'll be here.
L72833 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ You think Freeze will take the bait?
