L482568 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ And you want me to do you some big favor?
L482567 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I don't trust anybody.
L482566 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ You don't trust me?
L482565 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I can't tell you.
L482564 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ But... why? Why would you pretend?
L482563 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped -out tweakers? It was easy.
L482562 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ No one ever noticed?
L482561 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You ever notice how I always showed up, in the middle of a binge? Left before it was over? How I sneak away for cap-naps? How when the crank came around to me, I always said I'd just done one?
L482560 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
L482559 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ When? When did you ever see me use?
L482558 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ But...I've seen you.
L482557 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I'm not a tweaker.  I don't use drugs. I never had.
L482556 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ What?
L482555 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?
L482554 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ What the hell is that?
L482553 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Hey, check it out...
L482552 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Jimmy, look, there's something I have to tell you.
L482551 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
L482550 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Why?
L482549 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ It don't matter. I'll do it. And you sure as hell don't have to pay me.
L482548 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Wait till I tell you what it is.
L482547 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Okay
L482546 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You aren't coming with me.
L482545 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
L482544 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
L482543 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ What's this?
L482161 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Thanks for not laughing at me.
L482160 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Yes, Jimmy.
L482159 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Danny?
L482158 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Yes, Jimmy
L482157 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Was he the president?
L482156 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
L482155 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ What does J.F.K. stand for?
L482154 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Sure, Jimmy.
L482153 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Can I ask you something?
L482152 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ No. I'm good.
L482151 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ You want a hit?
L482096 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ No  You think she's a tweaker?
L482095 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?
L482093 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You're going to have to give me a little more than that, Jimmy.
L482092 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ He doesn't have one.
L482091 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You're going to have to explain that one.
L482090 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I think on account of his nose.
L482089 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
L482088 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Palmdale
L482087 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
L482086 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ You mean, like to throw 'em off?
L482085 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over.
L482081 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.
L482080 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?
L482079 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Not tonight.
L482078 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ You wanna score some go-fast?
L482077 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
L482076 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Jimmy, where do you find these people?
L482073 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ 10%.  That's ...
L482072 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if I can get the right price.
L482071 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Sure.
L482070 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Can you set that up?
L482069 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
L482068 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Can your man handle that?
L482067 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Fuuuuuck
L482066 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ A quarter of a million, Jimmy.
L482065 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ A quarter?  Danny that ain't even worth ...
L482064 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I know a buyer.  Guy's looking for a quarter's worth.
L482063 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.
L482062 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hook-up?
L482061 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I find myself in dire need of some cash.
L482060 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Don't get carried away.
L482059 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.
L482058 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ What?
L482057 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ See that?  That's just what I'm talking about.
L482056 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
L482055 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ So, why'd you want to see me?
L482052 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I guess there's just no substitute for good genes.
L482051 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
L482050 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ That's a good one.
L482048 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You're brain is in reverse mode ... cutting off your supply of dopamine. Here.  Have a beer.
L482047 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Why does it have to feel so bad?
L482046 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Sorry.

L482043 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I'm hurting.
L481939 +++$+++ u7413 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Oh ... that.  Ah, he was just juiced. He wouldn't have did nothin'
L481938 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy.

L481897 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ How the hell did we get this detail?
L482481 +++$+++ u7420 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ VERNE +++$+++ Understand what?
L482480 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You don't understand.
L482479 +++$+++ u7420 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ VERNE +++$+++ You might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose.  Or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter?
L482478 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ What does that mean?
L482477 +++$+++ u7420 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ VERNE +++$+++ By not disgracing her memory!
L482470 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You never did like me much, did you Verne?  And you can't stand it that I walked out of there alive and Liz didn't. You think I'm a coward, don't you?
L482469 +++$+++ u7420 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ VERNE +++$+++ That was my idea.
L482468 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?
L482656 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Yeah, dickhead.

L482653 +++$+++ u7417 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ POOH-BEAR +++$+++ What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
L482652 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
L482651 +++$+++ u7417 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ POOH-BEAR +++$+++ Just some buddies.
L482650 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ What the hell is this?
L482439 +++$+++ u7417 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ POOH-BEAR +++$+++ I'll keep that in mind.
L482438 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
L482437 +++$+++ u7417 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ POOH-BEAR +++$+++ No one. It was just a test. I need to be sure of who I'm dealing with from time-to-time.
L482436 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
L482435 +++$+++ u7417 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ POOH-BEAR +++$+++ Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.

L482133 +++$+++ u7417 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ POOH-BEAR +++$+++ Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
L482132 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Pooh-Bear, I don't mean to be rude, but I get the feeling you aren't taking me seriously.
L482131 +++$+++ u7417 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ POOH-BEAR +++$+++ If you say so.

L482109 +++$+++ u7417 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ POOH-BEAR +++$+++ No shit?  Fuck it.  I'll send it to Oliver Stone then. He'll get them to reopen the bastard.
L482108 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.

L482666 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ...  You're in the bathroom.  You've been shot in the shoulder ...

L482377 +++$+++ u7410 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ What? Is it bad?
L482368 +++$+++ u7418 +++$+++ m501 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ That's probably what he would have done if we hadn't found out about your get-rich-quick scheme.
