L638492 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ That!?!
L638491 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.
L638490 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I've got a theory. Look. If I can get used to heights just a little at a time... progressively see?
L638489 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ How?
L638488 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I think I can lick it.
L638487 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
L638486 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ My... the acrophobia.
L638485 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ What.
L638484 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
L638483 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Sorry, old man. Work.
L638482 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight. 
L638481 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
L638480 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Could be.
L638479 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ That's Skid Row... isn't it?
L638478 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
L638477 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
L638476 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
L638475 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Three whole weeks.
L638474 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
L638473 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
L638472 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Aren't you ever going to get married?
L638471 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Normal.
L638470 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Well?
L638469 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ That's following a train of thought.
L638468 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ How's your love life, Midge?
L638467 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ What a pleasant hobby.
L638466 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
L638465 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Uh-huh!
L638464 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
L638463 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I've never run across one like that.
L638462 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.
L638460 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Oh!
L638459 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ From that music.
L638458 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I'm having one now.
L638457 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
L638456 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
L638455 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
L638454 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.
L638453 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Well?... what'll you do?
L638452 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Ah, Johnny-O...
L638451 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
L638450 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ It's where you belong.
L638449 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
L638448 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
L638447 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
L638446 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Johnny, the doctors explained --
L638445 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I know. Everybody tells me.
L638444 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ It wasn't your fault.
L638443 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
L638442 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Why?
L638441 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I had to quit, Midge.
L638440 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
L638439 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ You sound so disapproving, Midge.
L638438 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
L638437 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L638436 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
L638435 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ How do you know? Personal experience?
L638434 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ More than you think.
L638433 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
L638432 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Tomorrow... the corset comes off. And this thing goes out the window.  I shall be a free man. I shall wiggle my behind... free and unconfined.
L638431 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ What's tomorrow?
L638430 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
L638429 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
L638428 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
L638427 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ I thought you said no more aches and pains?
L638426 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Ow!!
L638614 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
L638613 +++$+++ u8765 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ POP LEIBEL +++$+++ By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
L638612 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ How?
L638611 +++$+++ u8765 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ POP LEIBEL +++$+++ She died.
L638607 +++$+++ u8765 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ POP LEIBEL +++$+++ By... no... the name I do not remember. A rich man, a powerful man.  It is not an unusual story. She came from somewhere small, to the south of the city... some say from a mission settlement... young, yes; very young.  And she was found singing and dancing in a cabaret by the man... wait... wait... Ives! His name was Ives!  Yes. And he took her and built for her this great house in the Western Addition... and there was a child. Yes. This was it. The child.
L638606 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ By whom?
L638605 +++$+++ u8765 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ POP LEIBEL +++$+++ It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
L638604 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
L638603 +++$+++ u8765 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ POP LEIBEL +++$+++ Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...
L639153 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this...  ...and the skirt out. 
L639152 +++$+++ u8766 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SALESWOMAN +++$+++ Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
L639151 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Can we have it by tonight?
L639150 +++$+++ u8766 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SALESWOMAN +++$+++ Well...
L639149 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ How soon can it be altered?
L639148 +++$+++ u8766 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SALESWOMAN +++$+++ Oh, yes! It may need some slight alterations, but it is madam's size.  All right, dear.  We'll have it for you to try in a moment.
L639145 +++$+++ u8766 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SALESWOMAN +++$+++ I thought so!
L639144 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Yes! That's it!
L639138 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --
L639137 +++$+++ u8766 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SALESWOMAN +++$+++ She'll be out in a moment.
L639121 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Not tweed -- it's a smoother material, with a larger collar and belted. 
L639120 +++$+++ u8766 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SALESWOMAN +++$+++ But you said grey, sir.
L639119 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
L640983 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
L640982 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ Can't do what?
L640721 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person!
L640720 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
L640716 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Bullshit it's not accesory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops, you explain it was an accident...
L640715 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ They'll get us on accesory to murder.
L640642 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Don't touch her. Call 911.
L640641 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ Jesus.
L640632 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I need a drink.
L640631 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ She's fucking hot!
L640619 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Excellent.
L640618 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ The stripper's here.
L640938 +++$+++ u8780 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ SUIT +++$+++ Well that's what I said.
L640937 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I didn't hear you.
L640936 +++$+++ u8780 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ SUIT +++$+++ I said how's it going?
L640935 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ What did you say?
L640934 +++$+++ u8780 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ SUIT +++$+++ What's that?
L640933 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ What?
L640932 +++$+++ u8780 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ SUIT +++$+++ How ya doing?
L641029 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You go home!
L641028 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Go home!
L641027 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
L641026 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
L641019 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ You fucking bastard!
L641018 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife.
L641007 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You're a loser.
L641006 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.
L641004 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Eat my ass!
L641003 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ And you're a little fucking reject.
L641002 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ About anybody but yourself. You never have.
L640899 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
L640898 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.
L640828 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ What are you fucking talking about?
L640827 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
L640826 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ The hell I don't.
L640825 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ The hell you do.
L640824 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I have plenty of friends.
L640823 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
L640822 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Don't point at me.
L640821 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You're not a team player.
L640820 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ What did you say?
L640819 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You're pathetic.
L640818 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ This is pathetic.
L640789 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ It's sacrilegious.
L640788 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Why?
L640684 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Why?!
L640683 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ I don't know why the floor was wet!
L640682 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Why was the floor wet?
L640681 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ The floor was wet. She slipped!
L640654 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Playing?
L640653 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ We were playing...she slipped...she hit her head.
L640644 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ She's dead.
L640643 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
L640559 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Franco mother-fucking Harris!
L640558 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...
L640517 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I don't have to...
L640516 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Name one.
L640515 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Multiple reasons.
L640514 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Oh, and why am I an asshole?
L640513 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ You're an asshole.
L640512 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You're an asshole Adam.
L640504 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Boyd brought up divorce statistics.
L640503 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
L640502 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
L640501 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
L640452 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Sorry Fish.
L640451 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You're interrupting a personal conversation.
L640450 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
L640449 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ First of all...
L640448 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
L641034 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
L641033 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
L641017 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I got children. I've got a life.
L641016 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ They won't figure it out.
L641015 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
L641014 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ It has worked.
L641013 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
L641012 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Adam! Calm down.
L641011 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in!
L641001 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I don't give a damn.
L641000 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
L640988 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Nobody's smoking anybody out.
L640987 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ They're on me. They're smoking me out!
L640986 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Who? What are you talking about?
L640985 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ At the seven-eleven.
L640984 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What?
L640981 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I can't do this.
L640980 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What is your problem?
L640912 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Any time fat boy!
L640911 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Fuck you Boyd!
L640910 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Watch the tone fella.
L640909 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Don't talk to me about character.
L640908 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
L640907 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
L640906 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
L640905 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ You got us into this mess.
L640904 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What does that mean?
L640903 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
L640807 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Wrong. That is flat out wrong. Hell is for cowards, for hypocrites who fear to live by the strenght of their own convictions. This is war. Given the circumstances, and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we have chosen life over death. Two wrongs don't make a right. So our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less.
L640806 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
L640805 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.
L640802 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Alright. Let's do it.
L640801 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I am not flexible on this.
L640800 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ We have to get going.
L640797 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
L640796 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
L640795 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ That is absolutely not true.
L640794 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
L640793 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
L640792 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ So that's what we're doing.
L640791 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
L640790 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ How do you figure?
