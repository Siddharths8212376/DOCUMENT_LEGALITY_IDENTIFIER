L518221 +++$+++ u2849 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SARTORIUS +++$+++ You have to give me your word you won't come in.  Then I'll come out.
L518681 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Maybe you can.
L518680 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it.
L518679 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Jesus...
L518678 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
L518677 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ When did this happen?
L518672 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ I won't be making the trip.
L518671 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ What's wrong with you?  We need your help.
L518624 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ You do, you don't.  She's willing to give her life, you're willing to give yours, it's touching and magnificent, anything you want but -- this isn't the place for it.  Don't you see?  No, you don't.
L518623 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ I love her.
L518622 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you.  She will die.  Then what will you do?
L518621 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Into what?
L518620 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ Who are you trying to please? Yourself?  Her?  Which her, this one or that one.  Can you face both?  We are in a situation that is beyond morality.  So: Leave with her.  You'll see the transformation.
L518619 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ Maybe she doesn't need any.  Should we check?
L518618 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Her oxygen would have run out.
L518617 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
L518616 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Yes.
L518615 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
L518614 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Just get him to stop.
L518613 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ What plan?
L518612 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
L518611 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ What do you want?
L518610 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ No.
L518609 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
L518608 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ She knows everything.  She knows who she is.
L518549 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ Oh, this one you love?  What about the first one, the one you fucked and then put into a rocket and blasted into space?  You didn't love her?
L518548 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Get out --
L518547 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ Why do you think she hasn't suggested that?  It's the most obvious solution: Escape.  She knows she can't leave here --
L518544 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ She drank liquid oxygen.
L518543 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ What happened?
L518501 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ That's right.  And we all have to sleep, eventually.
L518500 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ They come when you sleep.
L518499 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ But they are human.  They certainly become human with incredible speed. First they're like they were in our memory, but then they fill in on their own.  DNA doesn't determine the hundreds of trillions of connections that occur in the brain, it's not dense enough.  They build up with experience.
L518498 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Human beings can die.
L518497 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ Perhaps it did.
L518496 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
L518495 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
L518494 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
L518493 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.
L518492 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ No.
L518491 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ We can liquidate the station.  Take the Athena back.
L518418 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ Who are you trying to convince?
L518417 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
L518416 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable, how you equivocate!  You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen!  This is happening, Kelvin.  Wake up.
L518415 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Not necessarily.
L518414 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?
L518413 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ -- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
L518412 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --
L518383 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ When you cut yourself pounding the door, did it hurt?
L518382 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
L518381 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.
L518354 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ Just a little strategy session.  But in person this time.
L518353 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Why?
L518352 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ Can you meet me and Sartorius on B deck in an hour?
L518351 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ What is it?
L518350 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ Kelvin, you awake?
L518296 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ That's ludicrous.  This is contact. We have found God.  The only issue is figuring out how to prove this in a way that will make sense back on Earth.  So how will we describe it, if we choose to describe it at all?
L518295 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
L518294 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long.  You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
L518293 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ I don't know.
L518292 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ What are you going to report back to Earth?
L518291 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ To who?
L518290 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ What will you say?
L518289 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ Told you what?
L518288 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ I wish you'd told me.
L518287 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ Probably.
L518286 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Will she come back?
L518285 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
L518284 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Rheya.
L518283 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ She has materialized from your memory of her.  What was her name?
L518282 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ Dead?
L518281 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ My wife.
L518280 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ I'm not sure.  It started with Gibarian.  He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown.  I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there.  By this time, we were getting visitors, too.  He was desperately trying to figure it out.  Day and night.  Who was she?
L518279 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ And professionally?
L518278 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ Personally, I think it's God.  At least, it fits my definition.
L518277 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ What was it?
L518276 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
L518275 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Shut up.
L518274 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ Was her breakfast conversation that bad?
L518249 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ Well, when you do go to sleep: barricade your door.
L518248 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ That depends.
L518247 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ How long can you go without sleep?
L518246 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ How much sleep?
L518245 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ How much sleep do you need?
L518243 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ Oh, that's a relief.
L518242 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Tell me.  I won't think you're insane.
L518241 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ She was real.  Where did she come from?
L518240 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ Who was it?
L518239 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.
L518238 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ Why, who did you see?
L518237 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Is there anybody else here?
L518218 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ Kelvin, if you see anything unusual...
L518217 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ He'll let me in.
L518216 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ In his lab.  He won't let you in.
L518215 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Where's Sartorius?
L518214 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ I can't talk just now.  I'm too tired.
L518212 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ I love chocolate.  I realized just yesterday how much I love it.  I thought maybe, if they let you bring personal effects, you might have snuck some through, because... well, I've been thinking about it.
L518211 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ What?
L518210 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
L518208 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ How?
L518207 +++$+++ u2850 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SNOW +++$+++ He's dead.
L518206 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian?
L518690 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Shhhh.  Just stay with me.  Stay with me.  Everything is forgiven. Everything.
L518689 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ How can you be here...
L518640 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ You must have been dreaming.
L518639 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
L518638 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ When?
L518637 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Where did you go before?
L518634 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Please.  Don't.
L518633 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ I've decided that if it is God, it's a sick God.  Its ambitions exceed its powers, but it doesn't realize it.  It's created a situation without a goal, and I hate that.  A God whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose.  And us?  We would have to have "an arrangement".  An unspoken understanding that I am not human. How can I not hate something that does that?
L518629 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ I don't know.  Something.  Anything.
L518628 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ What does it want?
L518627 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ A sleeping pill.  Do you want yours?
L518626 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ What are you taking?
L518606 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ I don't know anymore.  All I see is you.
L518605 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Am I really her?
L518604 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness.  I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were.  Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me.
L518603 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ I can't --
L518602 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
L518601 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
L518600 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ I think they help.
L518599 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ They do something to me.  It's hard to think straight.
L518598 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ I wish you wouldn't.
L518597 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ I want to stop taking those pills.
L518596 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Is that really what you want?
L518595 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ But then I would be dead now.
L518594 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
L518593 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
L518592 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Yes, you are --
L518591 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
L518590 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Who are you, then?
L518589 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
L518588 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ You exist here.  I keep telling you.
L518587 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ You're lying.
L518586 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ I want you here.
L518585 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ What do I have to do to stop it?
L518579 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Then you won't make it.
L518578 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
L518577 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ I can't stay here.
L518576 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Chris --
L518575 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ I never said I didn't.
L518574 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ You never said you wanted one.
L518573 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Neither did I.
L518572 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
L518571 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Thank you.
L518570 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ It wouldn't have made any difference.
L518569 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ You should have told me.
L518568 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris.
L518562 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ I want every second I can get with you.
L518561 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Then you'll die.
L518560 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm staying here with you.
L518559 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ You're lying.  I'm not human.
L518558 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ No.
L518557 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ I'm disgusting.
L518556 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
L518555 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Don't call me that.
L518554 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Rheya --
L518553 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
L518542 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching.
L518541 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this?
L518540 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ How can I tell?  You've seen both of me.  I only know what you're like here.  You're all I know.  There is no "You" from before.
L518539 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ That won't happen again.  We're different.
L518538 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Don't.  I'm the one at risk here. If we're playing out what happened before, I won't survive.
L518537 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ I love you.
L518536 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
L518535 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ It's all right.
L518534 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ What's happening to us?
L518531 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ He is.  But he was here...
L518530 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ You said he was dead.
L518529 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Gibarian.  He was here.
L518528 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ What's wrong?
L518512 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ If you're here.
L518511 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Do you?
L518510 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Do you want to stay here?
L518509 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Not this time.
L518508 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ But that's what happened before.
L518507 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
L518506 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it.
L518505 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now.
L518504 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
L518503 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Rheya.
L518502 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ You don't want me.
L518481 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ I'm just as human as you.  I see, I hear, I touch, and I feel just like you do.
L518480 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
L518479 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ You're the coward.
L518470 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Those are dreams.
L518469 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
L518468 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Can you sleep?
L518467 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ I love you, too.
L518466 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ No.  I love you.
L518465 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Was she right?
L518464 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ You... she said I didn't love her.
L518463 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Why did she do it?
L518462 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Yes.  Especially toward the end.
L518461 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ But we fought.
L518458 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
L518457 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.
L518456 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ When?  When I'm asleep?
L518455 +++$+++ u2848 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ RHEYA +++$+++ Sartorius.
L518454 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Who have you been talking to?
