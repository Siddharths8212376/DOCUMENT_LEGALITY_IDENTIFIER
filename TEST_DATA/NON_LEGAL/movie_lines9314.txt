L426607 +++$+++ u2405 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ BYRON +++$+++ Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?
L426606 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.
L426605 +++$+++ u2405 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ BYRON +++$+++ Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
L426604 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
L426603 +++$+++ u2405 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ BYRON +++$+++ Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed.
L426600 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Nobody. It just came to me.
L426599 +++$+++ u2405 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ BYRON +++$+++ Who gave you this idea?
L426598 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
L426597 +++$+++ u2405 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ BYRON +++$+++ Why?
L426596 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
L426595 +++$+++ u2405 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ BYRON +++$+++ You... in the Navy?
L426594 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I joined the Navy.
L426593 +++$+++ u2405 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ BYRON +++$+++ Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
L426592 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
L426591 +++$+++ u2405 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ BYRON +++$+++ So what're you doing in Seattle?
L426588 +++$+++ u2405 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ BYRON +++$+++ Wha-chu-say, palequero? Short time, long time, only ten dolla.
L426587 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Ay, palequero. Never hochi in the P.I.
L426581 +++$+++ u2405 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ BYRON +++$+++ Why the fuck didn't you invite me? I would've come.
L426580 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
L426579 +++$+++ u2405 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ BYRON +++$+++ I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
L426578 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
L426577 +++$+++ u2405 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ BYRON +++$+++ Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
L426576 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Neither have you, pard!
L426575 +++$+++ u2405 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ BYRON +++$+++ Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit!
L426574 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Hi, Byron.
L426562 +++$+++ u2405 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ BYRON +++$+++ Stop calling me 'sir! I ain't no officer. My name is Byron.
L426561 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Thank you, sir!
L426560 +++$+++ u2405 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ BYRON +++$+++ Okay, okay. You win.
L426559 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ What for?
L426558 +++$+++ u2405 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ BYRON +++$+++ Come back here, kid!
L426556 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place.
L426555 +++$+++ u2405 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ BYRON +++$+++ You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
L426554 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
L426553 +++$+++ u2405 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ BYRON +++$+++ I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia.
L426552 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Great.
L426551 +++$+++ u2405 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ BYRON +++$+++ This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
L426547 +++$+++ u2405 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ BYRON +++$+++ Well, that's how long I've been out at sea.
L426546 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I been calling for four months.
L426545 +++$+++ u2405 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ BYRON +++$+++ Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea...
L426544 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L426543 +++$+++ u2405 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ BYRON +++$+++ How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it?
L426541 +++$+++ u2405 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ BYRON +++$+++ I'm Byron. Nice to meet you.  C'mon. Let's go get your luggage.
L426540 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Yes, Sir.
L426539 +++$+++ u2405 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ BYRON +++$+++ You, Zack?
L427190 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Fuck the record. Now you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you.  Start back ten yards and take off from here. Not here... or there... but right here!  No excuses, Seeger! You are going to plant those legs here and then you're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! You want jets? Then do it, goddamnit!
L427189 +++$+++ u2406 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ CASEY +++$+++ Go on, Zack! Go for the record!
L427158 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push.  Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!
L427157 +++$+++ u2406 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ CASEY +++$+++ Zack, we've got to go.
L426737 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ You got it, Sweet Pea.  Nice boonies, Seeger.
L426736 +++$+++ u2406 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ CASEY +++$+++ The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
L426735 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
L426734 +++$+++ u2406 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ CASEY +++$+++ Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
L426733 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Good morning, girls.
L426719 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Great. You can go in my place.
L426718 +++$+++ u2406 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ CASEY +++$+++ Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
L426717 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your ass shot down.
L426691 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Maybe we'll be roommates, Seeger, and you'll find out how funny I really am...
L426690 +++$+++ u2406 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ CASEY +++$+++ You're pretty funny, Mayo.
L427076 +++$+++ u2410 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I don't mean anything by it.
L427075 +++$+++ u2407 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ESTHER +++$+++ He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. Do you, Joe?
L426850 +++$+++ u2407 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ESTHER +++$+++ A long time ago.
L426849 +++$+++ u2410 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ When did this happen?
L426848 +++$+++ u2407 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ESTHER +++$+++ Yes, Joe.
L426847 +++$+++ u2410 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Esther, do you think she's using...  ...birth control?
L426836 +++$+++ u2410 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Come over here where I can see you.
L426835 +++$+++ u2407 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ESTHER +++$+++ Joe!
L427328 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
L427327 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ See you in the fleet, sir!
L427326 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Well, goodbye.
L427325 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I know.
L427324 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
L427323 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!
L427306 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Get on your feet and find out how good, sir.
L427305 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ You're good.
L427301 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Yes, sir!
L427300 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get your scuzzy ass up here.
L427298 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Aw screw it...
L427297 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
L427296 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ It's important, sir!
L427295 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
L427294 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
L427293 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
L427224 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!
L427223 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?
L427216 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ But you don't understand. There's this girl he's gotten pregnant and she's putting him through hell, sir.
L427215 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.
L427214 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?
L426976 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Maybe there's hope for you yet.
L426975 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Yes, sir!
L426974 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Mayo, are those your friends?
L426968 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Not a fucking chance, asshole!
L426967 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ That's not true, sir! I've changed a lot since I've been here! And I'm gonna make it, sir!
L426966 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Pity you don't have the character.
L426965 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I don't want to do something anybody can do.
L426964 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
L426963 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ No, sir!
L426962 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Why? Because you can do it alone?
L426961 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I want to fly jets, sir!
L426960 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
L426959 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I want to fly, sir!
L426957 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Sell it to the Air Force, Mayo!
L426956 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
L426955 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.
L426954 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir!
L426953 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Hey, what do you say we call off this little charade of yours over a couple of beers at Trader Jon's...? Come on, man. You're about as close to being officer material as me.
L426950 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ No you're not. You're failing the big one, baby, and I don't just mean in here. I mean in life. I've watched you, Mayo, and you don't mesh. You grab-ass and joke around but you don't make friends, not the way the others do.
L426949 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I'm doing okay, sir.
L426948 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser.  Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo?
L426947 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ That's a lie, Mayo. You've gone through a lot worse, haven't you?
L426946 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
L426945 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ She may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have. I've seen your college record. I've never heard of most of those schools. Tell me something, Mayo. Did you buy that degree?
L426942 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Get into your fatigues, Mayo. Before the weekend's out, you'll quit.
L426941 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
L426940 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I want your D.O.R.
L426653 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I thought I recognized the work.  Be proud of those wings. They're the only ones you're gonna leave here with, Mayo-naise.
L426652 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
L426651 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
L426650 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Not exactly, sir.
L426649 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up.  You got an injury there, Mayo?
L426648 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
L426647 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ What's your name, boy?
L426645 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ No, sir!
L426644 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
L427222 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Zack, don't!
L427221 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ What did you call me, Mayo?
L426679 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Fall out on the lawn in five minutes, in your Poopie suits!
L426678 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Whatever you say, Mayonnaise.
L426643 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Stop whispering, Sweet Pea, you're giving me a hard on!
L426642 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ No, sir.
L426641 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
L426640 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
L426639 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Where are you from, boy?
L426638 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ No, sir.
L426637 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
L426636 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ No, sir!
L426635 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Lauder, Sweet Pea!
L426634 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ No, sir.
L426633 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ No, sir!
L426632 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ No.
L426631 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?
L426630 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ I didn't call you anything before that.
L426629 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Before that.
L426628 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ I called you Sarge.
L426627 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ What did you call me, boy?
L426626 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Pardon?
L426625 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ What did you call me?
L426624 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ How're you doing, Sarge?
L426623 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Hi, son.
L426622 +++$+++ u2409 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ GROUP +++$+++ Yes, sir!
L426621 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I know why most of you are here. We're not stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I'm gonna find that out. Understand?
L426620 +++$+++ u2409 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ GROUP +++$+++ Yes, sir!
L426619 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision! Understand?!
L426618 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I don't believe what I'm seeing! Where've you been all your lives, at an orgy? Listening to Mick Jagger and bad mouthing your country, I'll bet.
L426617 +++$+++ u2409 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ GROUP +++$+++ Yes, sir!!
L426616 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Louder!
L426615 +++$+++ u2409 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ GROUP +++$+++ Yes, sir!
L426614 +++$+++ u2408 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Now when I say "understand" I want the whole group to say, "Yes, sir!" Understand?
L426845 +++$+++ u2410 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
L426844 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Yes I do!
L426843 +++$+++ u2410 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Do you honestly think you'll find a boy in that... that officer's school who's serious about marriage?
L426842 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
L426841 +++$+++ u2410 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
L426840 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
L426839 +++$+++ u2410 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ But you knew right off what I was talking about, didn't you, Paula! Did you let that boy --
L426838 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ I don't know what it is. It could be anything.
L426834 +++$+++ u2410 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What are you tired from?
L426833 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Daddy, I don't want to get into anything with you tonight. I'm tired and I...
L426832 +++$+++ u2410 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I said, come here!
L426831 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ I know I'm late and I'm sorry, but Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and...
L427254 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Well, I'll be goddamned.
L427253 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
L427252 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ What?
L427251 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ Sid, there's no baby.
L427250 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
L427249 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
L427248 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now.
L427247 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ You what?
L427246 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
L427245 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
L427244 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!
L427243 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...
L427242 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ No way. I'm so happy I'm about to bust. Here, honey. This is for you. It cost me my whole savings, but I said what the fuck.
L427241 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?
L427240 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Forget that. Come on. Got a little surprise...
L427239 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
L427238 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you.
L427174 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ Let's just wait and see what happens.
L427173 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ ...I'd want to pay for the abortion... I'd want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side.  So how late are you, Lynette?
L427172 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing.
L427171 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ What other issue is there, Sid?
L427170 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ No. But that's not the only issue here, sweetheart. There's a lot more to it than that.
L427169 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
L427168 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
L427167 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
L427166 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ How late?
L427165 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ I'm a little late, that's all.
L427164 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now?
L427121 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ Then, I'll see you around.
L427120 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
L427119 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
