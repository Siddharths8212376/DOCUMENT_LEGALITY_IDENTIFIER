L441203 +++$+++ u7046 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
L441202 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yeah... ?
L441201 +++$+++ u7046 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Joe?
L441199 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Very funny. I had a box of Pampers under my arm for Chrissake!
L441198 +++$+++ u7046 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Have you changed your aftershave?
L441197 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!
L441196 +++$+++ u7046 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Don't know, Joe.
L440900 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Would you take a client if you were constantly thinking: "I hope this guy doesn't touch me. I don't even want him to <u>breathe</u> on me?"
L440899 +++$+++ u7046 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ That's perfectly clear.
L440898 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
L440897 +++$+++ u7046 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Fine, Joe.
L440896 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? I don't get it. Don't they get confused? "Is that mine? I thought it was yours." Hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative... I think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is.
L440895 +++$+++ u7046 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Okay, Joe...
L440894 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
L440893 +++$+++ u7046 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Probably since she was born.
L440892 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Since when?
L440891 +++$+++ u7046 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Duh...
L440890 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... <u>lesbian</u>?
L440889 +++$+++ u7046 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Karen Berman. Aunt Teresa. My cousin Tommy who lives in Rochester. Eddie Meyers from the office. Joe Cantwell, he's one of the partners. His lover, Greg. Stanley, the guy who's putting in our kitchen cabinets.
L440888 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Who?
L440887 +++$+++ u7046 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Lots.
L440886 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ How many do you know?
L440885 +++$+++ u7046 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ How many gays do you know?
L440884 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Not especially.
L440883 +++$+++ u7046 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ You have a problem with gays, Joe.
L440735 +++$+++ u7046 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Give me the camera, Joe.
L440734 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You load the film... ? No, on this side... or this side? Don't move the baby!
L440758 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Tell Iris all about it.  Take good care of Mrs. Finley, Iris.  Beckett, come in.
L440757 +++$+++ u7048 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MRS. FINLEY +++$+++ Now that you mention it...
L440756 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
L440755 +++$+++ u7048 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MRS. FINLEY +++$+++ Yeah. Do I have a case?
L440749 +++$+++ u7048 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MRS. FINLEY +++$+++ Why should I?
L440748 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
L440747 +++$+++ u7048 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MRS. FINLEY +++$+++ Right.
L441257 +++$+++ u7044 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ KENTON +++$+++ I felt, and still feel, nothing but the deepest sympathy and compassion for people like Maria, who have contracted this terrible disease through no fault of their own.
L441256 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
L441255 +++$+++ u7044 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ KENTON +++$+++ I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
L441254 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?
L441253 +++$+++ u7044 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ KENTON +++$+++ <u>She</u> didn't try to conceal it.
L441250 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Like firing Andrew Beckett taught <u>him</u> a lesson?
L441249 +++$+++ u7044 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ KENTON +++$+++ Yes, we did.
L441248 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You taught him a lesson.
L441247 +++$+++ u7044 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ KENTON +++$+++ We stuck his head in the latrine, after ten of us had used it.
L441246 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ How did you do that?
L441245 +++$+++ u7044 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ KENTON +++$+++ Yeah. But we took care of him.
L441238 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
L441237 +++$+++ u7044 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ KENTON +++$+++ Going on... like...?
L441236 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?
L441235 +++$+++ u7044 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ KENTON +++$+++ Not when I was in the Navy.
L441234 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Any women on board?
L441233 +++$+++ u7044 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ KENTON +++$+++ Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.
L441038 +++$+++ u7044 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ KENTON +++$+++ A trial takes <u>time</u>, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?
L441037 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Whoa, whoa...  What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz?
L441473 +++$+++ u7043 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JUDGE GARNETT +++$+++ Beckett?
L441472 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
L441471 +++$+++ u7043 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JUDGE GARNETT +++$+++ This would be a good time to break for the day...
L441244 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You had one guy "like that?"
L441243 +++$+++ u7043 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JUDGE GARNETT +++$+++ Let's continue.
L441226 +++$+++ u7043 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JUDGE GARNETT +++$+++ No. We don't... However, as regards this witness, I'm going to sustain the defense's objection.
L441225 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
L441224 +++$+++ u7043 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JUDGE GARNETT +++$+++ In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation.
L441025 +++$+++ u7043 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JUDGE GARNETT +++$+++ Very good, Joe. Now, Belinda, I've got a figure over here, of one million, five. I...
L441024 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Based on what my client would have earned over the next three years, including benefits and projected raises, and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome... We would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars.
L441016 +++$+++ u7043 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JUDGE GARNETT +++$+++ Hold it, Joe.  He wants to come back to work, Chuck.
L441015 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
L441014 +++$+++ u7043 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JUDGE GARNETT +++$+++ By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?
L441013 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ If it please Your Honor, we <u>hope</u> to settle this matter.
L441005 +++$+++ u7043 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JUDGE GARNETT +++$+++ On behalf of the defendants?
L441004 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
L441003 +++$+++ u7043 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JUDGE GARNETT +++$+++ I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
L441002 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
L441001 +++$+++ u7043 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JUDGE GARNETT +++$+++ Attorney for the plaintiff?
L441513 +++$+++ u7044 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ KENTON +++$+++ You have to make a decision: is this guy partner material?
L441512 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ ... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it.
L441041 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ Andy, you don't want this.
L441040 +++$+++ u7044 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ KENTON +++$+++ You'll be sorry, Beckett.
L440969 +++$+++ u7044 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ KENTON +++$+++ Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?
L440968 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ Wait a minute. The man was fired for incompetence, not because he has AIDS. You didn't know he was sick, did you, Bob?
L440959 +++$+++ u7044 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ KENTON +++$+++ We ought to be suing him.
L440958 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ Andrew brought AIDS into our offices, into our men's room. He brought AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic.
L440945 +++$+++ u7044 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ KENTON +++$+++ Dr. J.!
L440944 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ Julius!
L440810 +++$+++ u7044 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ KENTON +++$+++ Helloooo...
L440809 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?
L440599 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant.  It's an anti-trust action.
L440598 +++$+++ u7044 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ KENTON +++$+++ It's good to be King, hey Charles?
L441521 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ ... It's time to get this society back on track!
L441520 +++$+++ u7051 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ SEIDMAN +++$+++ ... But we shouldn't have fired him...
L441519 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ ... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
L441518 +++$+++ u7051 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ SEIDMAN +++$+++ I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...
L441497 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ If you feel differently, Bob, you should say so, when you're called to the stand. After all, this isn't a conspiracy.
L441496 +++$+++ u7051 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ SEIDMAN +++$+++ Charles...
L441495 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a note of that. Andy didn't lose the complaint in his computer. He never put it in. He lied about that, too.
L441490 +++$+++ u7051 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ SEIDMAN +++$+++ No matter how hard I try, I can't lose a file in my computer.
L441489 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ ... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy.  What, Bob?
L441488 +++$+++ u7051 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ SEIDMAN +++$+++ I've discovered something interesting, Charles.
L440965 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ Bob. I must ask you to shut the fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say "I might not be able to serve our clients to the <u>best of my ability</u>?" He said nothing. And now, Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, Philadelphia, judicial establishment. My God.
L440964 +++$+++ u7051 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ SEIDMAN +++$+++ He was doing a great job.
L440963 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"
L440962 +++$+++ u7051 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ SEIDMAN +++$+++ That's kind of... extreme, Walt. Andy's private life is none of our business.
L440957 +++$+++ u7051 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ SEIDMAN +++$+++ Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
L440956 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?!
L440955 +++$+++ u7051 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ SEIDMAN +++$+++ Charles...
L440954 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
L440953 +++$+++ u7051 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ SEIDMAN +++$+++ Jesus.
L440952 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ ... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. Did <u>any</u> of them know Andy was sick? <u>How</u> did they know? Did he tell them? Did they notice something was wrong with his appearance? None of this information got to the managing partners. We know that. Make sure everyone else does too... And Beckett: I want to know everything about his personal life. Did he frequent those pathetic bars on Camac Street?
L443094 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Not sure. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing....
L443093 +++$+++ u7054 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
L443092 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Probably okay to talk to me now.
L443078 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
L443077 +++$+++ u7054 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ You came for us....
L443027 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT!
L443026 +++$+++ u7054 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ What? What is it?
L442998 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out.  Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.
L442997 +++$+++ u7054 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Gonna lose everybody out here....
L442791 +++$+++ u7054 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Lookit. Lookit!
L442790 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Don't wanna miss this.
L442848 +++$+++ u7059 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.
L442847 +++$+++ u7054 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?
L442601 +++$+++ u7054 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
L442600 +++$+++ u7059 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ Oh, Lord....
L442595 +++$+++ u7059 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ Assailing my fragile sense of security, that's what.
L442594 +++$+++ u7054 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
L442593 +++$+++ u7059 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ Tell me that was you.
L442592 +++$+++ u7054 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ <u>What</u>?
L442591 +++$+++ u7059 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
L443003 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?
L443002 +++$+++ u7054 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Three full bottles. But almost time to refill.
L442987 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!
L442986 +++$+++ u7054 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
L442985 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Bring the light!
L442929 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.
L442928 +++$+++ u7054 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything....
L442912 +++$+++ u7054 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope?
L442911 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Bottle-count.
L442486 +++$+++ u7054 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse?  Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me.
L442485 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last.
L443076 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ But I'm human. I know you view that as a weakness, but I'm sorry -- I <u>do</u> feel fear, theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes. I would die for them.
L443075 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ You barely know them.
L443074 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ I would try for them.
L443073 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ You'd die for them?
L443071 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ No one's gonna blame you. C'mon. Take my hand and save yourself, Carolyn.
L443070 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ But they...they could still be....
L443069 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Just give me your hand.
L443068 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Don't do this to me....
L443067 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Here. Make it easy on you.
L443066 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ I can't....I can't....
L443065 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Step aboard, Carolyn.
L443064 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ No, you see, I <u>promised</u> them...I have to...I have to go and....
L443063 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ 'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
L443062 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
L443061 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ They're already dead. Get on board.
L443060 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.
L443059 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Just come with me!
L443057 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
L443056 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ <u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
L443055 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
L443054 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ What, you're afraid?
L443053 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
L443052 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do..
L443051 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
L443050 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
L443039 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ We can't make it.
L443038 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!
L443037 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Riddick? How close?
L443036 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ So where the hell's God now, huh?  I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!
L443020 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ As fast as you can.

L442993 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ So everybody huddles together till the lights burn out? Until you can't see what's eating you? That the big plan?

L442991 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Back to the ship, huh?
L442925 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.

L442921 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Think about what?
L442920 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
L442919 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ <u>Listen</u>.
L442918 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Riddick? What the hell are you --
L442910 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
L442909 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ What do you see? Riddick?
L442895 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Saw something I didn't like.
L442894 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?
L442891 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Actually...  That's what I been askin' myself.
L442890 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ We can, can't we? Trust you?
L442889 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there.
L442888 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.
L442887 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ But I just wanted to say --
L442886 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Had it with deals.
L442885 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually --
L442768 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth twice as much alive.  Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and I'm just a payday. That's why he won't kill me. The creed is greed.
L442767 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Why, what'd you hear?
L442765 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ You scare me, Riddick. That's what you wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it, Can I get back to work now?
L442764 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
L442763 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Entered our minds.
L442762 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
