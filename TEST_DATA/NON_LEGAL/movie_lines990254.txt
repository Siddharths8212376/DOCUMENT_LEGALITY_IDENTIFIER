L480521 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show.  But what the hell.  It's not one specific thing.  It's more of a feeling. 
L480520 +++$+++ u7377 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE +++$+++ Why not?
L480519 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't think I could really describe it.
L480518 +++$+++ u7377 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE +++$+++ What was it that made you know?
L480517 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just <u>knew</u>.
L480516 +++$+++ u7377 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE +++$+++ What are you going to do, Sam?
L480515 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ It's hard to imagine.
L480514 +++$+++ u7377 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE +++$+++ Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more?
L480499 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What's she talking about?
L480498 +++$+++ u7377 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE +++$+++ We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
L480485 +++$+++ u7377 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE +++$+++ And I don't want to invade your privacy --
L480484 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
L480483 +++$+++ u7377 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE +++$+++ Why not?
L480482 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No.
L480481 +++$+++ u7377 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE +++$+++ Have you had any relationship since?
L480480 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ It's been about a year and a half.
L480479 +++$+++ u7377 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE +++$+++ Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
L480478 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ All righ...
L480475 +++$+++ u7377 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE +++$+++ I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
L480474 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you.
L480471 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Jesus, are we on the air? Jonah, for God's sake --
L480470 +++$+++ u7377 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE +++$+++ Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
L480469 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Who is this?
L480468 +++$+++ u7377 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE +++$+++ I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
L480467 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm probably not interested in whatever you're selling.
L480466 +++$+++ u7377 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE +++$+++ Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.
L480465 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hello.
L480490 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
L480489 +++$+++ u7377 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE +++$+++ I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
L480460 +++$+++ u7377 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE +++$+++ Fair enough.
L480459 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
L480458 +++$+++ u7377 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE +++$+++ I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
L480457 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ I don't know --
L480456 +++$+++ u7377 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE +++$+++ Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
L480455 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Yeah.
L480454 +++$+++ u7377 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE +++$+++ Is he home right now?
L480451 +++$+++ u7377 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE +++$+++ You want me to talk to him?
L480450 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
L480449 +++$+++ u7377 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE +++$+++ Why not?
L480448 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ No.
L480445 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ I'm worried about him, he's worried about me, I ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like I'm not supposed to know he's there.  Now it's Christmas, and you know what happens to people at Christmas.
L480444 +++$+++ u7377 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE +++$+++ And you're worried about him.
L480443 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.
L480442 +++$+++ u7377 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE +++$+++ I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.
L480440 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ She died.
L480439 +++$+++ u7377 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE +++$+++ Where's your mom?
L480438 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
L480437 +++$+++ u7377 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE +++$+++ You don't like the one he was now?
L480436 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ It's not for me.  It's for my dad.  I think he needs a new wife.
L480435 +++$+++ u7377 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE +++$+++ Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
L480434 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ It's not that late in Seattle.
L480433 +++$+++ u7377 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE +++$+++ No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?
L481040 +++$+++ u7378 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ GREG +++$+++ Right, right.
L481039 +++$+++ u7386 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ It is not --
L481038 +++$+++ u7378 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ GREG +++$+++ It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
L481037 +++$+++ u7386 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ No.
L481036 +++$+++ u7378 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ GREG +++$+++ How about rapacious and love- starved?
L481035 +++$+++ u7386 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.
L481032 +++$+++ u7378 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ GREG +++$+++ What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
L481031 +++$+++ u7386 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind.
L480717 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ This is going to be tougher than I thought.
L480716 +++$+++ u7379 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ You'll like it.
L480715 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
L480714 +++$+++ u7379 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ You'll see.
L480713 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What is it?
L480712 +++$+++ u7379 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ You'll find out.
L480711 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What's tira misu?
L480710 +++$+++ u7379 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.
L480709 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
L480708 +++$+++ u7379 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.
L480707 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Seventy... eight.
L480706 +++$+++ u7379 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ When's the latest time you were out there?
L480705 +++$+++ u7379 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Everywhere.  You can't even turn on the news without hearing about how some babe thought some guy's butt was cute.  Who the first babe to say this was I don't know, but it caught on.
L480704 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
L480703 +++$+++ u7379 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
L480702 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay.  That's not what I need your help for.  I want to know what it's like over there.
L480701 +++$+++ u7379 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda ... She's a weightlifter, but it's not like her neck is bigger than her head or anything --
L480601 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
L480600 +++$+++ u7379 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Hey, my plate is full.
L481067 +++$+++ u7380 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I'd rather die than eat on an airplane.  I'm telling them you're twelve so you can fly unaccompanied and they won't make you be carried around by a stewardess and everything.
L481066 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ I don't know.  Do I?
L481065 +++$+++ u7380 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Do you want a fruit plate?
L481064 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Window.
L481063 +++$+++ u7380 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Do you want an aisle or a window seat?
L481060 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ But how am I going to get there?
L481059 +++$+++ u7380 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
L481058 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Eighty dollars.
L481057 +++$+++ u7380 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
L481056 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
L481055 +++$+++ u7380 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ You have to go to her, Jonah. You have to find her.
L481054 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ I don't get it.
L481053 +++$+++ u7380 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
L480918 +++$+++ u7380 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Your only hope.
L480917 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Yeah.  What's that?
L480916 +++$+++ u7380 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ It's Y. O. H.
L480915 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ You think so?
L480914 +++$+++ u7380 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Write her.
L480728 +++$+++ u7380 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
L480727 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Dad, could you close the door?
L481189 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Sure.
L481188 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
L481187 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Okay.
L481186 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
L481165 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ It was all they had.
L481164 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I can't believe you flew first class.
L481163 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ No.
L481162 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
L481161 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ No.
L481160 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
L481159 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ If I didn't go.
L481158 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ When I found you?
L481157 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ I was scared of what you were gonna do.
L481156 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What if I couldn't get to you?
L481111 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Goddammit, I am sick of this --
L481110 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ No.
L481109 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Get out.
L481108 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
L481107 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
L481106 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Did too.
L481105 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Did not.
L481104 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ You said we could go to New York.
L481103 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ This conversation is finished.
L481102 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never did that.  Mom never said shut up to me.  Mom never yelled at me.
L481101 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Shut up.
L481100 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ What's wrong with Annie?
L481099 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
L481098 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Fine.  I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
L481096 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ This is the one I like.
L481095 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
L481094 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yes.
L481093 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Are you going with her?
L481092 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm only going to be away one night, okay, and Clarise will be here.  You'll have a swell time.  You'll watch a little Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm Street 12, I'll never know.
L481091 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ It might be in the kitchen.
L481090 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Have you seen my wallet?
L480963 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica.
L480962 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.
L480959 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ The one who wrote us.
L480958 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Who is Annie?
L480957 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.
L480956 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Victoria? She's okay.
L480955 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ God, she's beautiful.
L480953 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm never going to meet anyone who's going to measure up to your mom in your eyes? What do you think? There's a perfect woman walking around out there?
L480952 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Was Mom an adjustment?
L480951 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Jonah, this isn't fair.  You don't know Victoria.  I hardly know her myself.  She is, in fact, a mystery to me.  She tosses her hair a lot.  Why does she do this? I have no idea.  Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her.  That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her.  Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit.  But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.
L480931 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ If she knew, she'd never forgive me.  It would be hopeless for the two of you.
L480930 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.
L480929 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ It's a short word.
L480928 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
L480927 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ I just called for a second.
L480926 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Everyone at work heard you.
L480925 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ No.
L480924 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Did you call that radio station again?
L480910 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ That's true.  Why is that?
L480909 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ The water tastes better in the kitchen.
L480908 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ There's a bathroom upstairs.
L480907 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ I was thirsty.
L480906 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What are you doing up?
L480905 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ I thought I saw a black widow spider.
L480904 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Don't ever do that again.
L480880 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm glad you liked it.  Good night, Jonah.
L480879 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
L480878 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Thank Victoria for dinner.
L480877 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Okay.
L480876 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Jonah!
L480875 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ It's only ten o'clock.
L480874 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
L480858 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ She's going to cook something for us?
L480857 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Why is she bringing that bag?
L480856 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ There she is.
L480855 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --
L480827 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Perfect.  We'll be there.
L480826 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
L480825 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. 
L480823 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Oh, right.
L480822 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ It's a sign.
L480821 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
L480820 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Dad!
L480819 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ WAIT!!!  -- "and while we're on the subject, let's just say right now that Brooks Robinson was the best third baseman ever. It's important that you agree with me on that because I'm from Baltimore."  Dad, she thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
L480818 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Jonah, I'm leaving --
L480817 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"
L480816 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Not now, Jonah --

L480812 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
L480811 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ This is a good letter, Dad.
L480810 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut. 
L480809 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Great.
L480805 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Sleepless and Son.  Baltimore.

L480778 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
L480777 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
L480776 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ I'm starting to forget her.
L480775 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
L480774 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Like do you believe in heaven?
L480773 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't know.
L480772 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
L480771 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Is that what she used to sing?
L480770 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Bye bye blackbird.
