L59891 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Let go of me!
L59890 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Rick, you're lying!
L59889 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ C'mon, I knew it was you.
L59888 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ I can't trust you!
L59885 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Why don't you get undressed.
L59884 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
L59883 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
L59373 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ I love you.
L59372 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
L59371 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
L59370 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her.
L59369 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Your mother's not dead.
L59368 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.
L59367 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ You're really pissing me off.
L59366 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
L59365 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
L59364 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.
L59363 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Can't I just go with you guys?
L59362 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ This is it, lady. Last stop.
L59355 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Gonna get married...
L59354 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
L59353 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ You better not have too much joy.
L59352 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
L59320 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
L59319 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Um... that's very relaxing.
L59318 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Good...
L59317 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ That feels so great.
L59316 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ C'mere.
L59315 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
L59314 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
L59313 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
L59312 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ About what?
L59311 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ I don't know... I just feel scared.
L59310 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ What's the matter?
L59309 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
L59308 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Oh... I got something for that.
L59307 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ I can't sleep.
L59306 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Huh? Wha...
L59192 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
L59191 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Oh, those. Why do you ask?
L59190 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
L59189 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
L59188 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Are you going to have women at your party?
L59187 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
L59186 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ It looks awful.
L59185 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
L59184 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ You're going to have a bachelor party?
L59183 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
L59182 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
L59181 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
L59180 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ I think your dinner's burning.
L59179 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
L59178 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ What are we having?
L59177 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ But a fabulous cook.
L59176 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ God, you're a slob.
L59869 +++$+++ u396 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ ILENE +++$+++ I know what I'm doing... Go!
L59868 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Ilene, are you crazy?
L59867 +++$+++ u396 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ ILENE +++$+++ Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
L59866 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Let's go.
L59522 +++$+++ u396 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ ILENE +++$+++ Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
L59521 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
L59520 +++$+++ u396 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ ILENE +++$+++ Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
L59519 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Are you sure this is a good idea?
L59251 +++$+++ u396 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ ILENE +++$+++ Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs.
L59250 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Ilene, Rick promised...
L59249 +++$+++ u396 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ ILENE +++$+++ Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
L59248 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
L59247 +++$+++ u396 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ ILENE +++$+++ If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.
L59872 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ I hope those guys are all right.
L59871 +++$+++ u402 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MRS. THOMERSON +++$+++ I hope Ilene's all right.
L59767 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Quiet, Mother.
L59766 +++$+++ u402 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MRS. THOMERSON +++$+++ What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
L59679 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Ilene, we don't really know that.
L59678 +++$+++ u402 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MRS. THOMERSON +++$+++ A strange wang right in my palm.
L59264 +++$+++ u402 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MRS. THOMERSON +++$+++ You know your father enjoys his company.
L59263 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Why is Cole here?
L59246 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Great, Mom.
L59245 +++$+++ u402 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MRS. THOMERSON +++$+++ I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
L59815 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ Any time, Al.
L59814 +++$+++ u394 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ EXECUTIVE +++$+++ Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
L59673 +++$+++ u394 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ EXECUTIVE +++$+++ I think I screwed that one once.
L59672 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ Great bathing suit.
L59558 +++$+++ u394 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ EXECUTIVE +++$+++ Well... hope she'll be very happy.
L59557 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ A real turd.
L59556 +++$+++ u394 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ EXECUTIVE +++$+++ Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?
L59554 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.
L59553 +++$+++ u394 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ EXECUTIVE +++$+++ Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.
L59518 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ That's more like it.
L59517 +++$+++ u397 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ JUMBO +++$+++ Give him the works.
L59516 +++$+++ u397 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ JUMBO +++$+++ Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
L59515 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
L59514 +++$+++ u397 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ JUMBO +++$+++ Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash.
L59513 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Why?
L59512 +++$+++ u397 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ JUMBO +++$+++ I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
L59511 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ What are you...
L59510 +++$+++ u397 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ JUMBO +++$+++ That's it, prick lips.
L59509 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Screw you!
L59508 +++$+++ u397 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ JUMBO +++$+++ They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
L59507 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Your whores never showed up.
L59506 +++$+++ u397 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ JUMBO +++$+++ What are you talking about, asshole?
L59505 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
L59386 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Okay. Nice to meet you both.
L59385 +++$+++ u397 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ JUMBO +++$+++ They'll be up there in a half hour.
L59384 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
L59380 +++$+++ u397 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ JUMBO +++$+++ Let's see your bread.
L59379 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.
L59707 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on.
L59706 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Rick, I really think I'm in love.
L59705 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
L59533 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I didn't know you were into that.
L59532 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Yes.
L59531 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Hookers beat you up?
L59476 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Screw that.
L59475 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
L59474 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ I'm going to see what the hell happened.
L59473 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Guy paints a beautiful picture.
L59472 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
L59471 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ It's true.
L59468 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ What's going on?
L59467 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
L59148 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Let's have a toast.
L59147 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
L59140 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Because I love her. What can I tell you?
L59139 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?
L59130 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
L59129 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
L59107 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
L59106 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Let's go.
L59103 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Screw you...
L59102 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Gary, you're quite an animal.
L59101 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.
L59593 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Milt?
L59592 +++$+++ u405 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RAJAH +++$+++ Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
L59591 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
L59590 +++$+++ u405 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RAJAH +++$+++ You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
L59589 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
L59588 +++$+++ u405 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RAJAH +++$+++ Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
L59587 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ I'll take some.
L59586 +++$+++ u405 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RAJAH +++$+++ That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
L59585 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ I want women.
L59584 +++$+++ u405 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RAJAH +++$+++ I'm telling you I am, Joe.
L59583 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ You're a pimp?
L59582 +++$+++ u405 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RAJAH +++$+++ What can I be doing for you?
L59853 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Good.
L59852 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ That's it.
L59851 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Is that all the coke in the place?
L59341 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ I don't want to talk about it. I love you guys. I love my friends.
L59340 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Larry, you and your wife got problems?
L59339 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
L59337 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody.
L59336 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ So, Larry, how have you been?
L59835 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
L59834 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
L59823 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ It's Bullwinkle.
L59822 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
L59704 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party.
L59703 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Ha, ha, ha.
L59702 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
L59701 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ I couldn't find any razor blades.
L59700 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
L59699 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ I'm trying to slash my wrists.
L59698 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ What the hell are you doing?
L59606 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
L59605 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Really?
L59604 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Yeah, I guess so.
L59603 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ You okay?
L59602 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
L59601 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
L59552 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after "Falcon Crest."
L59551 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ I just want to be alone.
L59550 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
L59549 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
L59348 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ What do you mean, it changes?
L59347 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
L59346 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
L59345 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
L59344 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Right.
L59343 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
L59342 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You want to share it?
L59912 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!
L59911 +++$+++ u399 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ You're all under arrest. Open up!
L59406 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
L59405 +++$+++ u399 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
L59404 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
L59403 +++$+++ u399 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ It's on the tenth floor.
L59402 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002.
L59401 +++$+++ u399 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
L59400 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Are any of those right?
L59910 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
L59909 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
L59856 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ No sob story is going to change my mind.
L59855 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ The end.
L59842 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Oh, no!
