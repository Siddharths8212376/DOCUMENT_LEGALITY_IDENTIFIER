L172801 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Now you see why he was elected principal?
L172800 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Collins is a great man!
L172793 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Shut up Lloyd. You're not married yet.
L172792 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ That would be me, sir. The wife made stew last night.
L172784 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Kids.
L172783 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
L172782 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Where did you learn that word?
L172781 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Shut Up! Buttlick!
L172780 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You take that back!
L172779 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You're not my real dad.
L172778 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I will stop this car right now.
L172777 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Shut up!
L172776 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Don't use that tone with me, young man.
L172775 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Will not.
L172774 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
L172773 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ LLOYD, she's my mom.
L172772 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
L172771 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ She did not.
L172770 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Your mom made a move on me.
L172769 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What?
L172768 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Whoa. What was that?
L172761 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!
L172760 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
L172759 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Exactly! A pirate!
L172758 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yeah, go-cart accident.
L172757 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Peg leg?
L172756 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
L172755 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Yeah, he's a pirate.
L172754 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
L172753 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Sounds like a pirate.
L172752 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...
L172751 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I know the type. Lives in the basement, smells like a sponge...
L172750 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Just a guy I hang out with.
L172749 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Who's Captain Rob?
L172748 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.
L172744 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Go fish.
L172743 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Got any crazy eights?
L172728 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ JESSICA? Please hold for my reaction.
L172727 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Maybe we should ask Jessica to join the class.
L172721 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Now that's more of what we're looking for.
L172720 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Wow! It's a half-boy, half-horse. The boys walk up to him, impressed.
L172715 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ HARRY, what are you doing? She's a foreign exchange student. She doesn't speak the English.  CHING CHONG ching chingy chingy chong chong.
L172714 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ ...oh also, we even have a slogan. 'S' and 'P' stands for 'Special People', which is the kind of kids we are. 'A' and 'Z' is for 'Aren't Zeros' because that is less then one, and when you put it all together it spells...
L172708 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ And nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity.
L172707 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ We're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, I mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking.
L172704 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You brave soldier.
L172703 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ One day they'll find a cure.
L172699 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Oh, of course.
L172698 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ The second R is silent.
L172697 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ H A R R Y...
L172696 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ It'll be like taking candy from a stranger.
L172695 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.
L172694 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Can we eat there tomorrow?
L172693 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ No, I just usually eat my lunch on the crapper. Saves time. Out with the old, in with the new.
L172692 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Oh, is this your special place?
L172691 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You know, you're the first person I've brought here.
L172687 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Wow.
L172686 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ The principal.
L172685 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Who's Principal Collins?
L172683 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Shift to your left.
L172682 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ God, she's beautiful. My wiener's all tingly.
L172681 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Yeah, he's aces.  Thanks, Turk!
L172680 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
L172679 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day.
L172621 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Me too!
L172620 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
L172619 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Oh my gosh, I don't think she's even wearing underwear!
L172617 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ No.
L172616 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?
L172615 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Why not?
L172614 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ No no no no no.
L172613 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Don't we want them to talk to us?
L172612 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Yeah, dangerous cult. Don't make eye contact or they might talk to you.
L172607 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You're it.
L172606 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What?
L172605 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I don't know. I'm pretty familiar with the school and I've never seen that "X". But... I do know something.
L172604 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
L172603 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Cool.
L172602 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ No, it's a treasure map.
L172601 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Is that what I think it is?
L172600 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I think it's just over there.
L172599 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Me too!
L172598 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I go to school where I live.
L172597 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Home school? What's that?
L172596 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Home school. Til today.
L172595 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I haven't seen you around here before.
L172594 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
L172593 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
L172592 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Probably because we've never met.
L172591 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
L172590 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
L172589 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
L172588 +++$+++ u4906 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
L172587 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You could've saved that for the tooth fairy!
L172954 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ I wouldn't know. Being that I'm just the teacher and all.
L172953 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
L172952 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ I thought I told you to get lost.
L172933 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ You mean the lunch room?
L172932 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
L172931 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
L172930 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ Oh, you're good.
L172929 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Are you wearing a coconut bra?
L172928 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ No.
L172927 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ So can I come along?
L172926 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  Well, I see you have a camera.
L172925 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
L172924 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
L172923 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
L173340 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ Don't play with me dear, you're way out of your league.
L173339 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE.
L173338 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ Then where did you get this not my tape.
L173337 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ That's not your tape.
L173336 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape.
L173335 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.
L173334 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
L173328 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ Not to expect you tonight.
L173327 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ So what did you say to my parents on the phone?
L173284 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ One phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear.
L173283 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ My parents are going to wonder where I am.
L173282 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ Oh I think you do.
L173281 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.
L173280 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
L173279 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
L173278 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ You had some questions.
L172949 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ And, Ching Chong, you're not a Special Needs kid. You're just a foreign exchange student.
L172948 +++$+++ u4919 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ TURK +++$+++ You're just jealous.
L172947 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
L172946 +++$+++ u4919 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ TURK +++$+++ Special Needs class.
L172945 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ TURK, what are you doing here?
L172642 +++$+++ u4919 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ TURK +++$+++ TURK, leave him alone.  You're coming too.
L172641 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ TURK, leave him alone.
L173484 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
L173483 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ He's going to be in jail for a long time.
L173369 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ "My dream date with Principal Collins."
L173368 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
L173350 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ HARRY's treasure chest? Sure. I know where that is.
L173349 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
L173348 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ ... If I may quote the twentieth century poet  - Joe Piscahpo:  You look Marvelous...
L173343 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Looks like the best man won.
L173342 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess.
L173185 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Thanks, Lloyd. But I didn't find what I was looking for. Oh can you do me a favor and clean up? Collins can't know we were here.
L173184 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
L173183 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ That's my boyfriend.
L173182 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ This is so embarrassing, it's never happened before. Well, maybe a couple of times, but I was alone.
L173181 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ No, it was a complete waste of time.
L173180 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
L173179 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ That's it. I'm done.
L173178 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Me too. I'm almost there.
L173177 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I'm so close I can feel it.
L173175 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Let's just do it and get out of here.
L173174 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ What are you doing?
L173172 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ So no small talk? Good, 'cause I don't know how to make that. Yep. Small talk. Not for me. Not a fan.  Got any hobbies? How 'bout this weather?
L173171 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
L173170 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
L173169 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Well, something stinks.
L173146 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Oh, go on.
L173145 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Oh, baby, you're the bestest.
L173138 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Tomorrow night?
L173137 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ So, when can we do it?
L173126 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
L173125 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ So could you get us into the principal's office?
L173124 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
L173123 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.
L173122 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I know, you want go for a ride.
L173121 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
L173120 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You know, "some". The fag stuff.
L173119 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ What?

L173094 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Do you want me to pet your head?
L173093 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Well I was born in St. Louis.
L173085 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Don't answer me. Say what I say.
L173084 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Yes, what?
L172893 +++$+++ u4907 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ This school's never had one before. I'd like to talk to you and all your special friends.
