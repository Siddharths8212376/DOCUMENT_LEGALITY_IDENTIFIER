L327835 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Unless he or someone else wants him to get caught.  Maybe he never ordered the weapon, Lou.  Somebody else did. It was picked up at the post office early morning when Oswald's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job.  Lou, come alive.  These things are not adding up.
L327834 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ I never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in Texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced.
L327779 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas in '65.  Two in the morning on some highway.  A hit and run.
L327778 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Can we find her?
L327777 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ There was Rose Cheramie.  A whore. Two Cubans threw her out of a car on the way to Dallas.
L327776 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
L327775 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 
L327773 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ ...not a single frayed collar or cuff, new haircuts, fresh shaves, clean hands - new shoe leather. Look at the ear of the cop... That's a wire.  What's a cop wearing a headset for?  I think they're actors, chief; they're not cops.
L327772 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
L327771 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ ...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
L327770 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ A photographer from The Dallas Times Herald got some great shots of them never published...
L327769 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
L327768 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go.  No record of them ever being questioned.
L327708 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ We're going back into the case, Lou - the murder of the President.  I want you to take some money from the Fees and Fines Account and go to Dallas - talk to some people.  Bill, I want you to get Oser on the medical, the autopsy, Susan on Oswald and Ruby histories, tax records...
L327707 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ What are you driving at, boss?
L327706 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
L327704 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ "Once ONI, always ONI"?
L327703 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
L327702 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Post Office.
L327701 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Take a look across the street.
L327700 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ The Office of Naval Intelligence.
L327699 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Lou, you were in the Marines.  Who would be running that training?
L327698 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ I'd say he was probably getting intelligence training.
L327680 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago.
L327679 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.
L327560 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ He's been in trouble before.  Used to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern Airlines, but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14-year old boy.
L327559 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I know David - a strange character.
L327521 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Let's get outta here, Lou.  I saw too much stuff like this in the war.
L327520 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.
L327494 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ No word yet.  But they think it's in the head.
L327493 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh no!... How bad?
L327492 +++$+++ u1574 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Boss, the President's been shot.  In Dallas.  Five minutes ago.
L327491 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What's wrong, Lou?
L327627 +++$+++ u1573 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LONG +++$+++ Honey, another one of these.  This one's as weak as cricket pee-pee. Yessir, you mark my words, Jim, Vietnam's gonna cost Johnson '68 and it's gonna put that other varmint Nixon in - then watch your hide, 'cause there ain't no offramps on a freeway to Hell!
L327626 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
L327625 +++$+++ u1573 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LONG +++$+++ Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
L327624 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You think there were other men involved, Russell?
L327623 +++$+++ u1573 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LONG +++$+++ If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
L327622 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
L327621 +++$+++ u1573 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LONG +++$+++ Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet?  That dog don't hunt.
L327620 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
L327618 +++$+++ u1573 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LONG +++$+++ Don't get me started on that.  Those Warren Commission fellows were pickin' gnat shit out of pepper.  No one's gonna tell me that kid did the shooting job he did from that damned bookstore.
L327617 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
L327616 +++$+++ u1573 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ LONG +++$+++ Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? "Love Child."  It's fuckin' outa control.  Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House.
L328572 +++$+++ u1569 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JOHNSON +++$+++ No, it can't!
L328571 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
L328570 +++$+++ u1569 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JOHNSON +++$+++ Pictures like this don't show up on television!
L328568 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.
L328567 +++$+++ u1569 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JOHNSON +++$+++ Are they?  Why would they?
L328566 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
L328565 +++$+++ u1569 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JOHNSON +++$+++ Some people would say you're paranoid.
L328564 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
L328563 +++$+++ u1569 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JOHNSON +++$+++ There have been a number of reports in reputable news media - Time, Newsweek, our own NBC - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury.  What is your response?
L328560 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
L328559 +++$+++ u1569 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JOHNSON +++$+++ Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
L328786 +++$+++ u1588 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ X +++$+++ I keep thinking of that day, Tuesday the 26th, the day after they buried Kennedy, L.B.J. was signing the memorandum on Vietnam with Ambassador Lodge.
L328785 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
L328784 +++$+++ u1588 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ X +++$+++ It never did. 
L328783 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ ...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
L328782 +++$+++ u1588 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ X +++$+++ I knew the man 20 years.  That's him.  The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring.  What was he doing there?  If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say "protection" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of "okay" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered.  And in fact they were - you never heard of them again.
L328781 +++$+++ u1588 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ X +++$+++ Does it matter?  Another technician. But an interesting thing - he was there that day in Dealey Plaza.  You know how I know?  That picture of yours.  The hoboes... you never looked deep enough...
L328780 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ His name?
L328779 +++$+++ u1588 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ X +++$+++ You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
L328778 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Ever ask him?
L328777 +++$+++ u1588 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ X +++$+++ ...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
L328776 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ ...and your General?
L328775 +++$+++ u1588 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ X +++$+++ ...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.
L328774 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
L328773 +++$+++ u1588 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ X +++$+++ He's done it before.  Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro.  No big deal.  In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket.  Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...
L328755 +++$+++ u1588 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ X +++$+++ I think it started in the wind. Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like L.B.J. were committed to a war in Southeast Asia.  As early as '61 they knew Kennedy was going to change things... He was not going to war in Southeast Asia.  Who knows? Probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - Houston, New York - hell, maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows, it's international now.
L328754 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?
L328753 +++$+++ u1588 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ X +++$+++ You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
L328752 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well, thanks for coming.
L328309 +++$+++ u1588 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ X +++$+++ But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
L328308 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
L328307 +++$+++ u1588 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ X +++$+++ No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
L328306 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
L328305 +++$+++ u1588 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ X +++$+++ Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
L328304 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country?
L328290 +++$+++ u1588 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ X +++$+++ I'm not with the Agency, Mr. Garrison, and I assume if you've come this far, what I have to say interests you.  But I'm not going to name names, or tell you who or what I represent. Except to say - you're close, you're closer than you think...
L328289 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
L328288 +++$+++ u1588 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ X +++$+++ I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.
L328287 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
L328286 +++$+++ u1588 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ X +++$+++ I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
L328285 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yes.
L328284 +++$+++ u1588 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ X +++$+++ Jim Garrison?
L327754 +++$+++ u1577 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ You're so naive, mister.
L327753 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
L327752 +++$+++ u1577 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.
L327751 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
L327750 +++$+++ u1577 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
L327749 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ The assassination, Jack?
L327748 +++$+++ u1577 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
L327747 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
L327746 +++$+++ u1577 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
L327745 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
L327744 +++$+++ u1577 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Clay something, that was his name - Clay.
L327742 +++$+++ u1577 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ There was one guy, I don't know, big guy, business guy, white hair - I saw him come into the office once. He looked out of place, y'know - like a society guy.  Can't remember his name.  Oswald was with him.
L327741 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
L327737 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Anything more specific, Jack?  It's important.
L327736 +++$+++ u1577 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Yeah, he was there, too... sometimes he'd be meeting with Banister with the door shut.  Other times he'd be shooting the bull with Ferrie.  But he was there all right.
L327735 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ And Oswald?
L327734 +++$+++ u1577 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
L327732 +++$+++ u1577 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Banister was running his camp north of Lake Pontchartrain.  Ferrie handled a lot of the training.  There was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in Cuba.  A few Americans got trained, too.  Nazi types. Mercenaries.  But Ferrie was the craziest.
L327731 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Where is Banister in all this?
L327728 +++$+++ u1577 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Often?  He practically lived there. It was real cloak and dagger stuff. They called it Operation Mongoose. The idea was to train all these Cuban exiles for another invasion of Cuba. Banister's office was part of a supply line that ran from Dallas, through New Orleans to Miami, stockpiling arms and explosives.
L327727 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Was he there often?
L327726 +++$+++ u1577 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
L327725 +++$+++ u1577 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me.
L327724 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
L327723 +++$+++ u1577 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
L327722 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You have other information?
L327721 +++$+++ u1577 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ If you buy what you read in the paper.
L327720 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
L327719 +++$+++ u1577 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I don't know if I should talk about this.
L327718 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ How much more?
L327716 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yet on November 22, 1963 - the day of the President's murder - our police report says he pistol-whipped you with a .357 Magnum.  But the police report says you had an argument over the phone bill. Here, take a look at it.  Now, does a simple argument over phone bills sound like a believable explanation to you?
L327715 +++$+++ u1577 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Never touched me.
L327714 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ And he never hit you before?
L327713 +++$+++ u1577 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ More than ten years.
L327712 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
L328588 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ It's a means to an end.  This war has two fronts - in the court of law, we hope, against the odds, to nail Clay Shaw on a conspiracy charge. In the court of public opinion, it could take another 25 or 30 years for the truth to come out, but at least we're going to strike the first blow.
L328587 +++$+++ u1581 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ NUMA +++$+++ Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
L328586 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I don't think so, Al.  You remember the Hemingway story, "The Old Man and the Sea"?  The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in.  But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton.
L328584 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ He'll never make it.  If he wins, they'll kill him.  He wants to avenge his brother.  He'll stop that war. No, they'll kill him before they let him become President.
L328583 +++$+++ u1581 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ NUMA +++$+++ Sure sounds like he's winning.
L328442 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.  Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
L328441 +++$+++ u1581 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ NUMA +++$+++ Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
L328440 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I just don't want to do it.  What else?
L328439 +++$+++ u1581 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ NUMA +++$+++ She's the best damn witness we have!
L328438 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people.
L328241 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Okay, you handle it, Numa.  I don't have time for this nonsense.  We've obviously got the bastards worried now.  I'm going to Washington.
L328240 +++$+++ u1581 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ NUMA +++$+++ Well, believe what you want, boss, but we got to be more careful.  All these new volunteers, any one of them could be...
L328233 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You just need some sleep, Lou.  It won't look so bad when...
L328232 +++$+++ u1581 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ NUMA +++$+++ HOLD IT, CHIEF...
L327994 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Even your own wife, Numa.  Any of you want to quit, do me a favor... put us out of our misery.
L327993 +++$+++ u1581 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ NUMA +++$+++ Even my own wife, chief,  Who's wondering where I am?
L327793 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them.  The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.
L327792 +++$+++ u1581 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ NUMA +++$+++ Didn't someone say he didn't speak good Russian?
L328218 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ How long do you think it would take me to be appointed?
L328217 +++$+++ u1579 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
L328216 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ And what would I have to do?
L328215 +++$+++ u1579 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ I propose you accept an appointment to the bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your talent.  Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged?
L328214 +++$+++ u1579 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Nonsense.  You should be in a job where you can make decisions that have impact, affect the world.  Here you're trying to climb up the steep side of Mount Everest.
L328213 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
L328212 +++$+++ u1579 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
L328209 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ That's it.
L328208 +++$+++ u1579 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ That's all you've had all this time?
L328207 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
L328206 +++$+++ u1579 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ How many men are working with you on this?
L328205 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ If you must know, virtually nothing.
L328204 +++$+++ u1579 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
L328203 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
L328202 +++$+++ u1579 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
L328201 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Germany.
L328200 +++$+++ u1579 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Where were you?  Europe, Pacific?
L328199 +++$+++ u1579 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Splendid, love to see them.
L328198 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ They've been enlarged and show a lot of detail...
L328197 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ We can use all the support we can get.  I think these might interest you.
L328196 +++$+++ u1579 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
L328195 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
L328194 +++$+++ u1579 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.
L328193 +++$+++ u1579 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison.  Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.
L328192 +++$+++ u1568 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Welcome, Mr. Miller.  Jim Garrison. Would you care for some coffee?
L328515 +++$+++ u1587 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ Uh huh.
L328514 +++$+++ u1575 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ Do you walk home?
L328513 +++$+++ u1587 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ Yes.
L328512 +++$+++ u1575 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ And you get of from school at 3 every day?
L328510 +++$+++ u1575 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ And how tall are you?
L328509 +++$+++ u1587 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ Six.
L328508 +++$+++ u1575 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
L328507 +++$+++ u1587 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ That sounds fun.
L328506 +++$+++ u1575 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
L328505 +++$+++ u1587 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ Virginia.
L328504 +++$+++ u1575 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ Virginia or Elizabeth?
L328503 +++$+++ u1587 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ Yes?
L328502 +++$+++ u1575 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
L327860 +++$+++ u1584 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Then you don't stand a chance, Mr. Chief Justice, you have a lost cause. All I want is a lie detector test, and you refuse to give it to me. Because as it stands now - and the truth serum - how do you pronounce it - Pentothal - whatever it is. They will not give it to me, because I want to tell the truth... And then I want to leave this world.
L327859 +++$+++ u1583 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
L327858 +++$+++ u1584 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
L327857 +++$+++ u1583 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
L327856 +++$+++ u1584 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ What are they?
L327855 +++$+++ u1583 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
L327854 +++$+++ u1584 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Can I make a statement?  If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that?  Can you take me with you?
L327853 +++$+++ u1583 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ I am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing - I am going to have some lunch.
L327852 +++$+++ u1584 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ When are you going back to Washington, sir?
L327851 +++$+++ u1583 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.
L327850 +++$+++ u1584 +++$+++ m104 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?
L313917 +++$+++ u1589 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Oh, that's not a problem.
L313916 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
L313904 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Thanks.
L313903 +++$+++ u1589 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Not a problem.
L313902 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?
L313901 +++$+++ u1589 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Are you kidding, it looks great. You wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room. But you can go out dancing in this too. It's a total power suit.
L313900 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ This looks pretty good on me.
L313898 +++$+++ u1593 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.
L313897 +++$+++ u1589 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Can I help you?
L313104 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I won't forget.
L313103 +++$+++ u1590 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ ANITA +++$+++ Won't forget?
L313102 +++$+++ u1595 +++$+++ m105 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'll call her.
