L507749 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
L507748 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?
L507747 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner, maybe.
L507746 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
L507745 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ She thinks you're with Simone.
L507744 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Really?  Too bad.
L507743 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.  She broke up with Kent.
L507742 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ I noticed.
L507741 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ You know me -- married to my work.
L507740 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ I do okay.  How about you?
L507739 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?
L507490 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Night, Lainey.
L507489 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ Good-night, Daddy.
L507488 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Precisely.
L507487 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
L507482 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ No, not that.  I was just wondering -- in the bedroom scene in reel two why did Simone have no reflection when she walked in front of that mirror?
L507481 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
L507480 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ One thing bothered me.
L507345 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ I'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important.
L507344 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
L507343 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ -- I know, I don't know anything.
L507342 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ If anyone asks about Simone --
L507341 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ Okay, Dad.
L507327 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ You understood them.  That's what was amazing.  It's a nice day.  Let's eat outside.
L507326 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
L507325 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
L507324 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ I read.
L507323 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ How?
L507322 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ I do.
L507321 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
L507320 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
L507319 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
L507318 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ I know plenty of boys.
L507317 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
L507316 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ Why?
L507315 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Can't you stop that?
L507185 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ Only her brilliance.  To be honest, with what you had to work with, I was expecting a train wreck.  You really pulled it off.
L507184 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
L507183 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?
L507162 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ She can't watch herself.
L507161 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ Is she here tonight?
L507160 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ You know, I... don't know.
L507159 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
L507158 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Me too.
L507157 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ I missed you.  I wondered if you were ever coming back.
L507156 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ There was no other way.
L507155 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ -- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
L507154 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Not quite how I imagined it --
L507153 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ This week anyhow.
L507152 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ She still with Kent?
L507151 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.
L507150 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Your mother couldn't make it?
L507149 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Hello, Lainey.
L507148 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ Hi, Dad.
L507094 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're Viktor Taransky.
L507093 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart.  It's important.
L507091 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ You look very grown up.  What are you doing?  You meeting your mom for dinner?
L507090 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
L507089 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
L507088 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ I'm sorry Mom canned you.
L507087 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Hello, sweetheart.
L507086 +++$+++ u2775 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAINEY +++$+++ Hi, Dad.
L507957 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ It was premeditated -- I knew exactly what I was doing!  I strangled her!  I bludgeoned her! I set her on fire!  I did it!  I killed her!
L507956 +++$+++ u2776 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAWYER +++$+++ What?!
L507955 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ -- No!  I can't go along with this horseshit!  Just tell them they can fry me!
L507938 +++$+++ u2776 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAWYER +++$+++ An insanity defence.
L507937 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
L507936 +++$+++ u2776 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAWYER +++$+++ You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
L507935 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ I could get the death penalty.
L507934 +++$+++ u2776 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ LAWYER +++$+++ -- Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  It's the best deal you're going to get.
L507809 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ This should take care of Mother.
L507808 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Don't you?
L507807 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ You love her, don't you, Max?
L507806 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ No.  Thanks.  Absolutely.
L507805 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
L507804 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
L507803 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
L507802 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.
L507798 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ She hasn't uttered a word that whole time -- until she saw the big show.
L507797 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ She looks a lot like you.
L507796 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I traced her to a nursing home.  A young woman fitting Simone's description dropped her off five years ago.
L507795 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Looks familiar, doesn't she?  No one comes from nowhere, Taransky. You turn over enough rocks...
L507794 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ What now, Sayer?
L507699 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Er,... good.
L507698 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
L507697 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I want to see her.  Unless you show me Simone live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.
L507696 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
L507695 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I don't buy the whole recluse scam. How are you doing it?  What is it -- drugs?  Blackmail?  Mind-control? All three?  What do you do -- keep her locked in a box somewhere?
L507694 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Abduction?
L507693 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
L507692 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ I'm keeping it in trust.
L507691 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ -- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
L507690 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ -- I bet you have.
L507689 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I've done my homework.  I've studied her.
L507688 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ She was never in New Mexico.  She never left the studio.
L507687 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ The background is.
L507686 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ It's bogus.  You used an old library shot for the background.
L507684 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I think you do.  I know it's a fake.
L507683 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ I don't have time for this, Sayer.
L507682 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I know what you're up to.
L507681 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ It's a yacht.
L507680 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Nice boat, Taransky.
L507338 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.
L507337 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
L507336 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
L507335 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
L507334 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
L507333 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky.  Are you holding her hostage?  Are you some kind of Svengali?
L507241 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer.  Look it up.
L507240 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ So they're probably here.  You might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world, but I'm not buying it. What's really behind this Simone woman?  The public has a right to know.  Why is she staying out of sight?  And why the hell is she with you?  I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Viktor, but you're not exactly Cecil B. DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
L507239 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ They are alive, Sayer.
L507238 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols.  If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me.
L507237 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ I remember when the Echo had class -- the paper that could bring down governments.
L507236 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ This is the story.
L507235 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
L507234 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Max Sayer -- National Echo.
L507233 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Do I know you?
L507670 +++$+++ u2778 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
L507669 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I don't understand.
L507668 +++$+++ u2778 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ It's a hotel.
L507666 +++$+++ u2778 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ Is that why she left you?
L507665 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ -- I've been here before! -- On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
L507609 +++$+++ u2778 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ We used to.
L507608 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ -- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
L507607 +++$+++ u2778 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
L507606 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What do you want -- ?
L507605 +++$+++ u2778 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ Mr. Sayer...
L507559 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get to the bigger truth.  As for a photo -- if you can't do it, I know twelve million people who can.
L507558 +++$+++ u2778 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ Long live the First Amendment.
L507557 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Am I wasting my time with you? When she sues to protect her privacy, she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it.
L507556 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I will when you're finished writing it.
L507555 +++$+++ u2778 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ My God, you've got one?
L507554 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
L507553 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Which means they're significant.  Incriminating.  Perhaps, criminal.  She's hiding her past.  She's hiding her past.
L507552 +++$+++ u2778 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
L507551 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Obviously the name isn't real -- she's using an assumed identity, travels under a false name, checks into hotels with an alias.  She never stays in the same place two nights in a row.  Anything on the satellite photos?  What about the fingerprints?  What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?
L507550 +++$+++ u2778 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take.  But this Simone woman is good.
L507549 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ 24-hour tail on Taransky?
L507548 +++$+++ u2778 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ We've got our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
L507313 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yes, very.
L507312 +++$+++ u2778 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ Dark?
L507311 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Whatever it is, it's dark.
L507310 +++$+++ u2778 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ Why?
L507309 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Taransky isn't that good an actor. No, they're taking special precautions.  Some kind of new encryption.
L507308 +++$+++ u2778 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ Maybe he's talking to himself.
L507307 +++$+++ u2777 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Is it a jamming device?
L507837 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy.
L507836 +++$+++ u2779 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ NICOLA +++$+++ You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
L507835 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
L507834 +++$+++ u2779 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ NICOLA +++$+++ But that's Simone's part.
L507833 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ You could play the lead.
L507832 +++$+++ u2779 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ NICOLA +++$+++ Thank you.
L507831 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ You know you're really very good. I take back what I said.  I mean, you're really good.
L507829 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Yes, I'd like that.
L507828 +++$+++ u2779 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ NICOLA +++$+++ Would you like me to read?
L507827 +++$+++ u2779 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ NICOLA +++$+++ After I saw what Simone did with the role -- you know I fired all my people, went into rehab, took acting classes, changed my whole look.  She really inspired me.
L507826 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Thank you.  It's not important.
L507825 +++$+++ u2779 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ NICOLA +++$+++ I never apologized properly for what happened on "Sunrise".
L507824 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Yes.
L507823 +++$+++ u2779 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ NICOLA +++$+++ A lot's happened since we last saw each other.
L507030 +++$+++ u2779 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ NICOLA +++$+++ It wasn't working anyhow.  The scene with the thousand geese -- I don't understand this film.  I don't think anyone will understand it.  I already put out a press release -- citing "creative differences".
L507029 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Then show some.  They'll shut me down!
L507028 +++$+++ u2779 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ NICOLA +++$+++ I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
L507027 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ I beg you.  You can't do this to me.
L507023 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Taller?  What?
L507022 +++$+++ u2779 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ NICOLA +++$+++ Taller, Viktor.
L507021 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
L507020 +++$+++ u2779 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ NICOLA +++$+++ It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
L507019 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ -- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --
L507018 +++$+++ u2779 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ NICOLA +++$+++ You're in breach.
L507017 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ -- Nicola!  How was your massage?
L507248 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
L507247 +++$+++ u2781 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SECURITY GUARD +++$+++ What if it catches on fire?
L507246 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
L507245 +++$+++ u2781 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SECURITY GUARD +++$+++ Is Miss Simone coming today?
L507244 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Good.
L507243 +++$+++ u2781 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SECURITY GUARD +++$+++ No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
L507434 +++$+++ u2782 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE +++$+++ -- What you don't understand --
L507433 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Let's take it down a notch.
L507390 +++$+++ u2782 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE +++$+++ I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
L507389 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Simone, are you there?
L507284 +++$+++ u2782 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE +++$+++ I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
L507283 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
L507282 +++$+++ u2782 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE +++$+++ I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
L507269 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.
L507268 +++$+++ u2782 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE +++$+++ Hi.
L507442 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well, I think we've done enough for today.  You've been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  They're expecting us.
L507441 +++$+++ u2783 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE / VIKTOR +++$+++ You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
L507281 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ I was hoping you'd say that.
L507280 +++$+++ u2783 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE / VIKTOR +++$+++ Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
L507279 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
L507278 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ Yes.  Yes, I'm going to tell the truth about you, why wouldn't I...?  Of course, with Hank's tragic passing, the secret died with him.  I am going to tell the truth... after your next picture.
L507277 +++$+++ u2783 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE / VIKTOR +++$+++ You know what I'm talking about.
L507276 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ The only real truth is in the work.
L507275 +++$+++ u2783 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE / VIKTOR +++$+++ Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
L507274 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ See beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood. -- See that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the fake.  -- See that if the performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor is real.  Once a performance is committed to film, the blood and bones are gone anyway.  Only the spirit, the illusion remains. Besides, what's real anymore? These days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area.
L507273 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ You're right.  You're right.  Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
L507272 +++$+++ u2783 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE / VIKTOR +++$+++ Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
L507271 +++$+++ u2784 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ VIKTOR +++$+++ No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
L507270 +++$+++ u2783 +++$+++ m181 +++$+++ SIMONE / VIKTOR +++$+++ You did create me.
