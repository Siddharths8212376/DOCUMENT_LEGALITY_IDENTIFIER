L536157 +++$+++ u2951 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Naturally.  So what is your problem?
L536156 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.
L536155 +++$+++ u2951 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ You, ah...  You present the appearance of a man with a problem.
L535593 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Hamlet, Act I scene 4.
L535592 +++$+++ u2951 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.
L535549 +++$+++ u2951 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Then how.?
L535548 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That is what I said, Doctor.
L535547 +++$+++ u2951 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.
L535538 +++$+++ u2951 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ ... My God...
L535537 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ 10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.
L535535 +++$+++ u2951 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
L535534 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Specifically, Humpback Whales.
L535516 +++$+++ u2951 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ I liked him better before he died.
L535515 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
L535514 +++$+++ u2951 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
L535513 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
L535507 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.
L535506 +++$+++ u2951 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
L535505 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
L535504 +++$+++ u2951 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ You're joking...!
L535503 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
L535502 +++$+++ u2951 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
L535501 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
L535500 +++$+++ u2951 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
L535499 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ ... My shoes...
L535498 +++$+++ u2951 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
L535497 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
L535496 +++$+++ u2951 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Hi... Busy?
L536096 +++$+++ u2951 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!
L536095 +++$+++ u2955 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
L536094 +++$+++ u2951 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
L536093 +++$+++ u2955 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Fundoscopic examination --
L536092 +++$+++ u2951 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
L536091 +++$+++ u2955 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ What's your degree in, dentistry?
L536088 +++$+++ u2951 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Reading the patient's vital signs.
L536087 +++$+++ u2955 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ What the hell do you think you're doing?
L536086 +++$+++ u2955 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ I was not informed about observers.
L536085 +++$+++ u2951 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ We're just -- observing.
L536084 +++$+++ u2955 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Who are you? Doctor Adams was supposed to assist me.
L535383 +++$+++ u2952 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ We're out of control -- Rig for collision...
L535382 +++$+++ u2965 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SCIENCE OFFICER +++$+++ Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
L535381 +++$+++ u2952 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ Damage report!
L535375 +++$+++ u2965 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SCIENCE OFFICER +++$+++ Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
L535374 +++$+++ u2952 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ Can you isolate the wave?
L535373 +++$+++ u2965 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SCIENCE OFFICER +++$+++ Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
L535372 +++$+++ u2952 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ What's causing that!?
L535944 +++$+++ u2953 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ Depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor.
L535943 +++$+++ u2970 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ How long?
L535784 +++$+++ u2970 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
L535783 +++$+++ u2953 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ ... It gives me a great sense of history.
L535782 +++$+++ u2970 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ I have the coordinates of the reactor...
L535781 +++$+++ u2953 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ Team leader, this is team 2.   Come in, please...
L535695 +++$+++ u2953 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ Yes, under "U.S. Government." Now we need directions.
L535694 +++$+++ u2970 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Find it?
L536004 +++$+++ u2953 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ I'm wery sorry, but --
L536003 +++$+++ u2956 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ FBI AGENT +++$+++ Go ahead. Stun me.
L536002 +++$+++ u2953 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
L536001 +++$+++ u2956 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ FBI AGENT +++$+++ Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun.
L535995 +++$+++ u2953 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ I am? May I go now?
L535994 +++$+++ u2956 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ FBI AGENT +++$+++ You play games with me and you're through
L535993 +++$+++ u2953 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ I do not know your name.
L535992 +++$+++ u2956 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ FBI AGENT +++$+++ No, <u>my</u> name.
L535991 +++$+++ u2953 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ My name?
L535990 +++$+++ u2956 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ FBI AGENT +++$+++ Name?
L535989 +++$+++ u2953 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ The top of what?
L535988 +++$+++ u2956 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ FBI AGENT +++$+++ All right. Let's take it from the top.
L535987 +++$+++ u2953 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.
L535986 +++$+++ u2956 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ FBI AGENT +++$+++ Like who you really are and what you're doing here and what this thing is.
L535985 +++$+++ u2953 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ Like what?
L535984 +++$+++ u2956 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ FBI AGENT +++$+++ All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?
L536246 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control!
L536245 +++$+++ u2953 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not responding.
L536140 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
L536139 +++$+++ u2953 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
L535789 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Understood. What is your plan?
L535788 +++$+++ u2953 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
L535787 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Ah, well done, team 2.
L535647 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Dr. McCoy, you, Mr. Scott and Commander Sulu will convert us a whale tank.
L535646 +++$+++ u2953 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L535603 +++$+++ u2953 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ Sir, heat shields at maximum!
L535602 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No choice now, Scotty!
L535597 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ May fortune favor the foolish.  Mr. Sulu, Warp Speed!
L535596 +++$+++ u2953 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ Shields, aye.
L535595 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Shields, Mr. Chekov.
L535494 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
L535493 +++$+++ u2953 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
L535460 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty.
L535459 +++$+++ u2953 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.
L535458 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
L535457 +++$+++ u2953 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.
L535445 +++$+++ u2960 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ MORROW +++$+++ We are launching everything we have.
L535444 +++$+++ u2954 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ COUNCIL PRESIDENT +++$+++ Can you protect us?
L535443 +++$+++ u2960 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ MORROW +++$+++ We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
L535442 +++$+++ u2954 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ COUNCIL PRESIDENT +++$+++ "Neutralized?" How?
L535441 +++$+++ u2960 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ MORROW +++$+++ Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
L535440 +++$+++ u2954 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ COUNCIL PRESIDENT +++$+++ Status report, Admiral!
L535886 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Is there something wrong with the one I have?
L535885 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ You sure you won't change your mind?
L535822 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ You're not one of those guys from the military, are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?
L535821 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
L535807 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I was not.
L535806 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ So you were at Berkeley.
L535743 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The hell they did.
L535742 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ I suppose they told you that...?
L535741 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.
L535735 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
L535734 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Attempting the hell to communicate.
L535717 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Whoever said the human race was logical?  Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy.
L535716 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.
L536284 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>.  See you around the galaxy...
L536283 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
L536282 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Why does it have to be goodbye?
L536281 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You mean this is -- goodbye?
L536280 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
L536279 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Hey! -- Where you going?!
L536220 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ ... You have a point...
L536219 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
L536218 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
L536217 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ ... What does that mean?
L536178 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
L536177 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Oh my God, we're too late!
L536135 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ You need me.
L536134 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You tricked me.
L536127 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Thank you. For everything.  Beam me up, Scotty.
L536126 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
L536125 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
L536124 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
L536123 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
L536122 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
L536121 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
L536120 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
L536119 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?
L536117 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Calm yourself, Nurse.  Scotty, get us out of here!
L536116 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ If we keep going up, they'll catch us!
L536045 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ A spaceship with a missing man.
L536044 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
L536041 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ ... Damn!
L536040 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
L536039 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ ... Gone?!
L536038 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Kirk. They're gone.
L536037 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
L536036 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ But Kirk...
L536035 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
L536034 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
L536033 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Steady, now. We need your help.
L536032 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
L536031 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ It's true... what you said...
L535955 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Right.
L535954 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Here... In the park?
L535953 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
L535952 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ I bet you're a damn good poker player.
L535951 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
L535950 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ So. There we are.
L535949 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
L535948 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Sorry, that's classified.  I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?
L535947 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?
L535946 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Well, "Admiral," that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard.
L535938 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Noon tomorrow...?!
L535937 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
L535936 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
L535935 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
L535934 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You want the details?
L535933 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
L535932 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
L535931 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ I'm all ears.
L535930 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ All right. The truth?
L535929 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
L535928 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
L535927 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
L535926 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Who do you think I am?
L535925 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ ... Who are you?
L535924 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
L535923 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Wanna try it from the top?
L535919 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ You got a pocket pager? What are you, a doctor?
L535918 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What's what?
L535917 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ What's that?
L535916 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Let's just say that no humpback born in captivity has ever survived.  Problem is, they won't be a whole lot safer at sea because of all the hunting this time of year... So that, as they say, is that.  Damn.
L535915 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What do you mean now?
L535914 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
L535913 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
L535912 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
L535911 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Hm?
L535910 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Where could you take them?
L535909 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ I told you: I'm a sucker for hard luck cases. Besides, I want to know why you travel around with that ditzy guy who knows that Gracie is pregnant and calls you Admiral.
L535908 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
L535907 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Thanks. Cheers.
L535906 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
L535905 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
L535904 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
L535903 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
L535902 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
L535901 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ How will that be done, exactly?
L535900 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ ... You're very perceptive.
L535899 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You're upset about losing the whales.
L535898 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Just lucky, I guess.
L535897 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
L535894 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Good.  A large mushroom and pepperoni with extra onions. And a Michelob.
L535893 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Implicitly.
L535892 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Do you trust me?
