L235550 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Greer to Murphy.
L235594 +++$+++ u1090 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ RIVETER +++$+++ Or what?
L235593 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.
L235592 +++$+++ u1090 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ RIVETER +++$+++ These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.
L235591 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ I heard you. But I'm choosing to ignore you. Epps, let's go.
L235590 +++$+++ u1090 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ RIVETER +++$+++ Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
L235589 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ As I said, what seems to be the trouble?
L235588 +++$+++ u1090 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ RIVETER +++$+++ Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
L235587 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
L235567 +++$+++ u1091 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ VASILI +++$+++ You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.
L235566 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ You're kidding, right?
L235565 +++$+++ u1091 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ VASILI +++$+++ Twenty. You knock off twenty and then we see. After my guy looks at it.
L235564 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Fifteen, at the most.
L235563 +++$+++ u1091 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ VASILI +++$+++ That cost me twenty grand at least.
L235562 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
L235561 +++$+++ u1091 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ VASILI +++$+++ No, no. You got leak.
L235560 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
L235559 +++$+++ u1091 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ VASILI +++$+++ What's this?
L235558 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Better late than never.
L235557 +++$+++ u1091 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ VASILI +++$+++ I thought you say Tuesday.
L237484 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ JUST DO IT!
L237483 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ But I can't --
L237482 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!
L237481 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I just buzzed him in.
L237480 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What do you mean "on his way up"!?
L237479 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
L237478 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
L237477 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
L237476 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
L237475 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Yeah, I heard about that.
L237474 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ About what?
L237473 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Are you going to yell at me?
L237472 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Pumpkin, are you in there?
L237363 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want.
L237362 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What?
L237361 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
L237360 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it...
L237358 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Nothing.
L237357 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Pumpkin? What's wrong?
L237298 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Tell her to forget it - I don't need her help.
L237297 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them.
L237296 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I guess.
L237295 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Are you still looking for a job?
L237294 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What is it now?
L237293 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
L237154 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow.
L237153 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
L237152 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
L236925 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ God, how horrifying.
L236924 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Yup.
L236923 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Not the Maxine?
L236922 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Maxine.
L236921 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ YES.
L236920 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Give up?
L236919 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Who?
L236918 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Someone from the past.
L236917 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ How should I know?
L236916 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Guess.
L236915 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Who?
L236914 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place?
L236913 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Look at me -- I'm not even listening to a word you're saying.
L236912 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
L236911 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
L236910 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
L236909 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Will you get off my back for once?
L236667 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Not if I don't find that goddamn spatula.
L236666 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
L236665 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Have you seen my blue spatula?
L237453 +++$+++ u1093 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me!
L237452 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
L237451 +++$+++ u1093 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
L237450 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
L237449 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.
L237448 +++$+++ u1093 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ What are you trying to say?
L237447 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
L237446 +++$+++ u1093 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Hey... so, what brings you down here?
L237444 +++$+++ u1093 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ We're almost done.  Hi. Yeah... no, it's excluded. They've already paid the earnest money... well, let them bring it up if they notice it at the final walk through. Right, great, sounds good!
L237443 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.
L237442 +++$+++ u1093 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Seymour! Hello! What are you doing here?
L237285 +++$+++ u1093 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Hello...
L237284 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
L237283 +++$+++ u1093 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...
L237208 +++$+++ u1093 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Really? I never really cared for those. Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one?
L237207 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
L237206 +++$+++ u1093 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!
L237205 +++$+++ u1093 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just let me put a few things away.
L237204 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie.
L237202 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ No, really I --
L237201 +++$+++ u1093 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.
L237200 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh...
L237199 +++$+++ u1093 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
L237198 +++$+++ u1093 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
L237197 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
L237196 +++$+++ u1093 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?
L237195 +++$+++ u1093 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ DANA +++$+++ Oh I love to cook. I guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but I believe you should trust your instincts. When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... I don't know... harmless. Ready for ice cream?
L237194 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ SEYMOUR +++$+++ That was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this.
L237376 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ROBERTA +++$+++ I'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an official high school graduate before I can nominate you.  I had to give it to someone else...  But I'm sure next year I can --
L237375 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
L237374 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ROBERTA +++$+++ Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
L237373 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Help me what?
L237372 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ROBERTA +++$+++ Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
L237371 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I didn't check my messages...
L237370 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ROBERTA +++$+++ Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
L237369 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Huh?
L237368 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ROBERTA +++$+++ The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
L237367 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What do you mean?
L237366 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ROBERTA +++$+++ Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened.
L237172 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ROBERTA +++$+++ Let me know as soon as you can, Enid. This could be a great thing for you.
L237171 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I...
L237170 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ROBERTA +++$+++ Well, yes...
L237169 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
L237168 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ROBERTA +++$+++ So what do you think?
L237167 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ ...wow...
L237166 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ROBERTA +++$+++ As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
L237165 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Hmm.
L237164 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ROBERTA +++$+++ Well, I know this is really short notice, but I got a call from a very close friend at the Academy of Art & Design and she tells me that I'm allowed to place one student from your graduating class in a one year scholarship program... and, well, I hope you don't mind, Enid, but I took the liberty of submitting your name.
L237163 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
L237162 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ROBERTA +++$+++ Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
L237161 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Uh-oh.
L237160 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ROBERTA +++$+++ Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?
L237044 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
L237043 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ROBERTA +++$+++ And how does an image like this help us to see that?
L237042 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
L237041 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ROBERTA +++$+++ And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
L237040 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
L237039 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ROBERTA +++$+++ Did you actually do this painting?
L237038 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
L237037 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ROBERTA +++$+++ These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this.
L236955 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ROBERTA +++$+++ I see... interesting...
L236954 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
L236953 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ROBERTA +++$+++ And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
L236952 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
L236951 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ROBERTA +++$+++ Who is this, Enid?
L236748 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
L236747 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ROBERTA +++$+++ And what can you tell us about this... 
L237075 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Jesus...
L237074 +++$+++ u1102 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ It's not optional!
L237073 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
L237072 +++$+++ u1102 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
L237071 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
L237070 +++$+++ u1102 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ What the hell is wrong with you?!
L237065 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Okay, okay... I won't say a word...
L237064 +++$+++ u1102 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job.
L237063 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ But I was only trying to be friendly...
L237062 +++$+++ u1102 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
L237061 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
L237060 +++$+++ u1102 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
L237057 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ You can count on me, sir!
L237056 +++$+++ u1102 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ I'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way I can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds.
L237566 +++$+++ u1100 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Are you ready to go?
L237565 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Hey Josh.
L237564 +++$+++ u1100 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Hi Enid.
L237262 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Just take my word for it... if she ever finds out about this I'll never hear the end of it...
L237261 +++$+++ u1100 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Okay... I promise.
L237260 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Because if you do, I'll kill you!
L237259 +++$+++ u1100 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Why not?
L237258 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
L237257 +++$+++ u1100 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
L237256 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
L237255 +++$+++ u1100 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ How long have you been up?
L237254 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
L237253 +++$+++ u1100 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Oh, hi...
L237252 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Why do you have that stupid poster?
L237251 +++$+++ u1100 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ You must have known all along how I -- you know -- how I felt about you -- it must be totally obvious...  God... I always used to dream about this...
L237249 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!
L237248 +++$+++ u1100 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Yeah, well --
L237247 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ That's just the way I am!
L237246 +++$+++ u1100 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
L237245 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
L237244 +++$+++ u1100 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ When did I say I hated you?
L237243 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Then why do you hate me so much?
L237242 +++$+++ u1100 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Nothing.
L237241 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ "Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
L237240 +++$+++ u1100 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Yeah, right...
L237239 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
L237238 +++$+++ u1100 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ What do you mean "why"?
L237237 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Why?
