L5725 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
L5724 +++$+++ u97 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ THAI +++$+++ How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
L5723 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.

L5535 +++$+++ u89 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUGGER +++$+++ Uh..
L5534 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?

L5532 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Been here long?
L5531 +++$+++ u89 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUGGER +++$+++ The cash man!
L6314 +++$+++ u87 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MACTILBURGH +++$+++ It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
L6313 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
L5586 +++$+++ u87 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MACTILBURGH +++$+++ An elephant couldn't crack it.
L5585 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ This thing solid?
L5574 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Wonderful!
L5573 +++$+++ u87 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MACTILBURGH +++$+++ ...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
L5570 +++$+++ u87 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MACTILBURGH +++$+++ We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.
L5569 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
L5568 +++$+++ u87 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MACTILBURGH +++$+++ The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
L5567 +++$+++ u87 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MACTILBURGH +++$+++ Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
L5566 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
L5565 +++$+++ u87 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MACTILBURGH +++$+++ This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
L5564 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Talk English Doc.
L5563 +++$+++ u87 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MACTILBURGH +++$+++ It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
L5562 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Have you identified it?
L5561 +++$+++ u87 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MACTILBURGH +++$+++ Actually only one cell survived..
L5560 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ This is all that survived?
L6255 +++$+++ u91 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ How much time is left?
L6254 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ They just landed in the desert.
L5774 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
L5773 +++$+++ u91 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ I want your best man on this!
L5770 +++$+++ u91 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ ...What do you mean?
L5769 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
L5768 +++$+++ u91 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
L5767 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
L5480 +++$+++ u96 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ STAEDERT +++$+++ I'm about to, Mr. President.
L5479 +++$+++ u91 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
L5453 +++$+++ u91 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Gentlemen?
L5452 +++$+++ u96 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ STAEDERT +++$+++ My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
L5451 +++$+++ u91 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Recommendations.
L5450 +++$+++ u96 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ STAEDERT +++$+++ Wait or act.
L5449 +++$+++ u91 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Options.
L5448 +++$+++ u96 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ STAEDERT +++$+++ Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
L5447 +++$+++ u91 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.
L5446 +++$+++ u96 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ STAEDERT +++$+++ There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
L5445 +++$+++ u91 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
L5444 +++$+++ u96 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ STAEDERT +++$+++ Perfect, Mr. President.
L5443 +++$+++ u91 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Is that better?
L5442 +++$+++ u96 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ STAEDERT +++$+++ I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
L5441 +++$+++ u91 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Staedert, do you read me?

L5396 +++$+++ u92 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
L6225 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ I'm not at the hotel!
L6224 +++$+++ u94 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
L6223 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
L6222 +++$+++ u94 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Yes, Sir!
L6221 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
L6220 +++$+++ u94 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
L6219 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ How's that? Can you hear me better now?
L6012 +++$+++ u95 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ ...I can't wait to be among you.
L6011 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
L6009 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
L6008 +++$+++ u95 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ How's our deal coming along?
L6007 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ Got it.
L6006 +++$+++ u95 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
L6005 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
L6004 +++$+++ u95 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ ...Not far, now.
L6003 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ No... not at all.  Where are you?
L6002 +++$+++ u95 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Am I disturbing you?
L7002 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I just talked to her.
L7001 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
L7000 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Tom... she's dead.
L6999 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
L6998 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ What?
L6997 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Mrs. Christian.
L6996 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Who are you calling?
L6993 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Amy...
L6992 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
L6991 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Don't...
L6990 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You're killing me...
L6989 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I don't know what to say
L6988 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
L6987 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
L6986 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You should have.
L6985 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
L6984 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
L6983 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You don't understand...
L6982 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You couldn't?
L6981 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
L6980 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.
L6979 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
L6978 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I don't know.  I'm sorry...
L6977 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
L6976 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.
L6975 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Tom...
L6974 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...
L6973 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
L6972 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
L6971 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ What happened to you?
L6964 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Just do it, Amy, please, go.
L6963 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ ... What's going on?
L6962 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
L6961 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ What's wrong?  Are you alright?
L6960 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
L6959 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Tom?  Where have you been... ?
L6958 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
L6957 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Hello?
L6435 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even wear it.  It's a precaution.  Don't worry about me.
L6434 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Why the gun?
L6433 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
L6432 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I know.
L6431 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
L6430 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I understand.
L6429 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.
L6365 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.
L6364 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
L6363 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
L6362 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Sure.  I'll call the guy.
L6361 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
L6352 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I love you.
L6351 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I love you.
L6350 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Honey, I'm not, please...
L6349 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
L6348 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
L6347 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ How's the detective business?
L6344 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
L6343 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Okay, I believe you.
L6342 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
L6341 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I'm not accusing you...
L6340 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
L6339 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Your clothing reeks of it.
L6338 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
L6337 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ What's this... have you been smoking... ?
L6336 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Do you know how much I missed you?
L6335 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Welcome home.
L6612 +++$+++ u101 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ ANGRY DEALER +++$+++ There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
L6611 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
L6610 +++$+++ u101 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ ANGRY DEALER +++$+++ What you see is what I got, mister.
L6609 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Snuff?
L6608 +++$+++ u101 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ ANGRY DEALER +++$+++ There's nothing harder.
L6607 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Anything harder?
L6606 +++$+++ u101 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ ANGRY DEALER +++$+++ Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.
L6605 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What are these?
L6910 +++$+++ u102 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO +++$+++ I promised him to Machine.
L6909 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What the fuck... !
L6717 +++$+++ u102 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO +++$+++ Nobody knows anything.
L6716 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Dino...
L6715 +++$+++ u102 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO +++$+++ There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
L6714 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
L6713 +++$+++ u102 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO +++$+++ Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
L6712 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I'm telling you...
L6711 +++$+++ u102 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO +++$+++ Bullshit.
L6710 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
L6709 +++$+++ u102 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L6708 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
L6707 +++$+++ u102 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO +++$+++ What do you want?
L6864 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
L6863 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
L6862 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Bring the film, or we kill him.
L6861 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
L6860 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
L6859 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
L6858 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Friend of yours?
L6853 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I remember him.
L6852 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
L6846 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Shut up, cunt!  Do exactly as I say, or I'll put this arrow through your throat.
L6845 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Look, I don't know what this...
L6844 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
L6842 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Take out your gun!
L6841 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What are you... ?
L6840 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
L6835 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Sure.
L6834 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
L6833 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What are these for?
L6832 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ They should be here any minute.
L6831 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Where are the women?
L6830 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Excellent.
L6829 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Right here.
L6828 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ You brought the money?
L6815 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
L6814 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Where's that?
L6812 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ He's in.  It will be his pleasure.
L6811 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Machine's in?
L6810 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.
