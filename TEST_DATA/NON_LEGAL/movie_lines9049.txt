L195958 +++$+++ u888 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ WEIR +++$+++ Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...
L195957 +++$+++ u879 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ You weren't there. I saw it.
L195956 +++$+++ u888 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ WEIR +++$+++ No, he didn't.
L195955 +++$+++ u879 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...
L195695 +++$+++ u879 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
L195694 +++$+++ u888 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ WEIR +++$+++ The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
L195630 +++$+++ u888 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ WEIR +++$+++ No, thank you.
L195629 +++$+++ u879 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ Coffee.
L195628 +++$+++ u888 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ WEIR +++$+++ What?
L195627 +++$+++ u879 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?
L196384 +++$+++ u887 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ STARCK +++$+++ Run!
L196383 +++$+++ u879 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ What...?
L196379 +++$+++ u887 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ STARCK +++$+++ Hurry.
L196378 +++$+++ u879 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
L196366 +++$+++ u879 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ I don't want to go where the last crew went. I'd rather be dead.
L196365 +++$+++ u887 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ STARCK +++$+++ I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
L196364 +++$+++ u879 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ Can you shut it down?
L196363 +++$+++ u887 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ STARCK +++$+++ There must be a way! What about Engineering?
L196362 +++$+++ u879 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ How? The Bridge is gone.
L196358 +++$+++ u887 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ STARCK +++$+++ You're okay now, it's over...
L196357 +++$+++ u879 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ Let me breathe, let me breathe...
L195867 +++$+++ u887 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ STARCK +++$+++ I don't know, the screens are dead...!
L195866 +++$+++ u879 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ What's happening?
L195597 +++$+++ u887 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ STARCK +++$+++ It is not.
L195596 +++$+++ u879 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ Is that an offer?
L196337 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Oh God...
L196336 +++$+++ u880 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ Please... kill...
L196335 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
L196334 +++$+++ u880 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ Please...
L196323 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.
L196322 +++$+++ u880 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ What happened?
L196321 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
L196237 +++$+++ u880 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ No. I don't believe in that sort of thing.  But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe, of reality. Who knows where this ship has been... What it's seen...  And what it's brought back with it.
L196236 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ "Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
L196235 +++$+++ u880 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
L196234 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Hear what?
L196233 +++$+++ u880 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ Do you hear it? Right there.
L196231 +++$+++ u880 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ It gets worse.
L196230 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
L196229 +++$+++ u880 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ They thought it said, "Liberatis me," "Save me," but it's not "me." It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself."
L196228 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Go on.
L196227 +++$+++ u880 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
L196226 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ What is it?
L196225 +++$+++ u880 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ No.
L196224 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
L196222 +++$+++ u880 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ "Another man?" Who?
L196221 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.
L196190 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ We'll make it.
L196189 +++$+++ u880 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ He'll live... if we ever make it back.
L196076 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
L196075 +++$+++ u880 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.
L196048 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Goddammit, DJ, it was not a hallucination! I saw a man, he was on fire. And then he disappeared.
L196047 +++$+++ u880 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement...
L195941 +++$+++ u880 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
L195940 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ How is he?
L195919 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.
L195918 +++$+++ u880 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...
L195648 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ And this is mission specialist Dr. William Weir. We all know where we're going. Dr. Weir is going to tell us why.
L195647 +++$+++ u880 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ Trauma.
L195646 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...
L196188 +++$+++ u880 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ One thing at a time, let's keep him breathing. Start the drip, 15cc's fibrinogen, Christ, he's bleeding out...
L196187 +++$+++ u885 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ PETERS +++$+++ His peritoneum has ruptured...
L196186 +++$+++ u880 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...
L196184 +++$+++ u880 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ He's crashing...
L196183 +++$+++ u885 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ PETERS +++$+++ 90 over 50 and falling... .
L196182 +++$+++ u880 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ Pressure?
L196181 +++$+++ u885 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ PETERS +++$+++ I've got a pulse, he's alive...
L196100 +++$+++ u885 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ PETERS +++$+++ You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
L196099 +++$+++ u880 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ What's wrong?
L196023 +++$+++ u880 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ A power drain --
L196022 +++$+++ u885 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ PETERS +++$+++ What's happening...?
L195984 +++$+++ u885 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ PETERS +++$+++ Nothing. It's nothing.
L195983 +++$+++ u880 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ DJ +++$+++ What's wrong?
L195564 +++$+++ u881 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ Don't thank me, Bill. I'm not doing you any favors.
L195563 +++$+++ u888 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ WEIR +++$+++ Thank you.
L195562 +++$+++ u881 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day.
L195551 +++$+++ u888 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ WEIR +++$+++ A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them.
L195550 +++$+++ u881 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible.  Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage.  We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew...
L195549 +++$+++ u888 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ WEIR +++$+++ It's the Event Horizon. She's come back.
L195548 +++$+++ u881 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
L195547 +++$+++ u888 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ WEIR +++$+++ Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?
L195545 +++$+++ u881 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?
L195544 +++$+++ u888 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ WEIR +++$+++ You wanted to see me, Admiral?
L195575 +++$+++ u883 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ LYLE +++$+++ The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four.
L195574 +++$+++ u881 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?
L195573 +++$+++ u883 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ LYLE +++$+++ Some things you don't get over.
L195572 +++$+++ u881 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
L195571 +++$+++ u883 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ LYLE +++$+++ He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
L195570 +++$+++ u881 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ What's on your mind?
L195569 +++$+++ u883 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ LYLE +++$+++ Does he know that?
L195568 +++$+++ u881 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
L195567 +++$+++ u883 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ LYLE +++$+++ The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
L195566 +++$+++ u881 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
L195565 +++$+++ u883 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ LYLE +++$+++ You're not seriously considering sending him?
L195557 +++$+++ u883 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ LYLE +++$+++ Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
L195556 +++$+++ u881 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
L196160 +++$+++ u885 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ PETERS +++$+++ Starck!
L196159 +++$+++ u882 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ JUSTIN +++$+++ Oh my god OH MY GOD...
L196148 +++$+++ u882 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ JUSTIN +++$+++ From the Other Place...
L196147 +++$+++ u885 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ PETERS +++$+++ "The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
L196146 +++$+++ u882 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ JUSTIN +++$+++ ...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.
L196145 +++$+++ u882 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ JUSTIN +++$+++ The dark inside me.
L196144 +++$+++ u885 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ PETERS +++$+++ What does?
L196143 +++$+++ u882 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ JUSTIN +++$+++ It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
L196142 +++$+++ u885 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ PETERS +++$+++ What, Justin, what shows you?
L195827 +++$+++ u882 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ JUSTIN +++$+++ I'm going in.
L195826 +++$+++ u888 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ WEIR +++$+++ That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
L195825 +++$+++ u882 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ JUSTIN +++$+++ I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
L195802 +++$+++ u888 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ WEIR +++$+++ Background radiation. Perfectly safe.
L195801 +++$+++ u882 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ JUSTIN +++$+++ We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
L195800 +++$+++ u888 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ WEIR +++$+++ You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.
L195672 +++$+++ u888 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ WEIR +++$+++ I built it.
L195671 +++$+++ u882 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ JUSTIN +++$+++ How do you know all this?
L195670 +++$+++ u888 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ WEIR +++$+++ ...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.
L196174 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Justin. I won't let you die.
L196173 +++$+++ u882 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ JUSTIN +++$+++ But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
L196172 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
L196171 +++$+++ u882 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ JUSTIN +++$+++ ...I don't want to die...!
L196167 +++$+++ u882 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ JUSTIN +++$+++ Skipper, you gotta help me...
L196166 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Justin.
L196165 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Patch me through to him.
L195854 +++$+++ u882 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ JUSTIN +++$+++ Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
L195853 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Justin, finish your sweep.
L195755 +++$+++ u882 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ JUSTIN +++$+++ Yes, sir!
L195754 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.
L195583 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Start the countdown.
L195582 +++$+++ u882 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ JUSTIN +++$+++ Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
L195561 +++$+++ u888 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ WEIR +++$+++ Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship.
L195560 +++$+++ u883 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ LYLE +++$+++ The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
L195559 +++$+++ u888 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ WEIR +++$+++ The crew? Could they still be alive?
L195558 +++$+++ u883 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ LYLE +++$+++ Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.
L195555 +++$+++ u888 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ WEIR +++$+++ This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.
L195554 +++$+++ u883 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ LYLE +++$+++ I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
L195553 +++$+++ u888 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ WEIR +++$+++ I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
L195552 +++$+++ u883 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ LYLE +++$+++ Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
L195543 +++$+++ u883 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ LYLE +++$+++ Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
L195542 +++$+++ u888 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ WEIR +++$+++ This is Weir.
L196194 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Thanks.
L196193 +++$+++ u885 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ PETERS +++$+++ I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
L196192 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us.
L196115 +++$+++ u885 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ PETERS +++$+++ Justin.
L196114 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ That's a negative, Starck.
L196021 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Do it.
L196020 +++$+++ u885 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ PETERS +++$+++ I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
L195947 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan...
L195946 +++$+++ u885 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ PETERS +++$+++ I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
L195945 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
L195890 +++$+++ u885 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ PETERS +++$+++ Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay.
L195889 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ ...you okay?
L195888 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Peters...
L195887 +++$+++ u885 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ PETERS +++$+++ Skipper...
L195886 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Can anybody hear me...
L195852 +++$+++ u885 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ PETERS +++$+++ Crystallized.
L195851 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ ...how's the client?
L195850 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters...
L195831 +++$+++ u885 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ PETERS +++$+++ Frozen.
L195830 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Alive?
L195829 +++$+++ u885 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ PETERS +++$+++ I found one.
L195819 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
L195818 +++$+++ u885 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ PETERS +++$+++ Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
L195817 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ What you got, Peters?
L195816 +++$+++ u885 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ PETERS +++$+++ Okay. I'm on the bridge.
L195812 +++$+++ u885 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ PETERS +++$+++ There's no one here, Skipper.
L195811 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ The blood came from somewhere, Peters...
L195792 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Starck, you still showing those readings?
L195791 +++$+++ u885 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ PETERS +++$+++ I can see the hatch.
L195788 +++$+++ u885 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ PETERS +++$+++ I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
L195787 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Peters is right, no one's here.
L195783 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
L195782 +++$+++ u885 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ PETERS +++$+++ That means they didn't abandon ship.
L195773 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
L195772 +++$+++ u885 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ PETERS +++$+++ Jesus its huge.
L195771 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
L195770 +++$+++ u885 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ PETERS +++$+++ We've got pressure.
L195595 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ I am sorry. But now we have to go to work.
L195594 +++$+++ u885 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ PETERS +++$+++ No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
L195593 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
L195592 +++$+++ u885 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ PETERS +++$+++ Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
L195591 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ What's the hold up?
L196428 +++$+++ u888 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ WEIR +++$+++ NOOO!
L196427 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ You can't have them. Go to hell.
L196425 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Starck... Cooper...
L196424 +++$+++ u888 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ WEIR +++$+++ I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
L196423 +++$+++ u884 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ You're lying...!
L196422 +++$+++ u888 +++$+++ m57 +++$+++ WEIR +++$+++ There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING.
