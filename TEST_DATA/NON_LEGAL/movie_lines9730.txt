L150955 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
L150954 +++$+++ u4722 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ Oh, how beautiful!
L150953 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You can open it now, I guess. Lois Huggins says that's proper,

L150951 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Merry Christmas, Irena.  I brought you a present.
L150908 +++$+++ u4722 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ Oh, but the winter's fun. There's the wind and the snow. You'll like the warm fire upon the hearth, and the long, long nights.
L150907 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
L150906 +++$+++ u4722 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ All right, Amy.  Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
L150905 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ My dolls. We can pretend.

L150903 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ No, I don't think that's very much fun. Let's play house instead.  You be the friend who comes to see me.  I'll show you my children.
L150901 +++$+++ u4722 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ Pretend, darling.  It's All Soul's Eve.  Round about the fire we go...  Over the flames we leapt

L150897 +++$+++ u4722 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ There's an oak leaf.  Add a maple.
L150894 +++$+++ u4722 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ Of course,
L150893 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ This is more fun than just pretend.
L150892 +++$+++ u4722 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ That's right!
L150891 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Yes, yes! I see Prince,
L150890 +++$+++ u4722 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
L150889 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ A princess?
L150888 +++$+++ u4722 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ Oh yes they do.  Look.  One is like a tall princess.
L150887 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ The numbers simply don't mean anything
L150886 +++$+++ u4722 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ But you must!
L150885 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I'll just never learn arithmetic.
L150884 +++$+++ u4722 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ Can't you get it, darling?
L150883 +++$+++ u4722 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ Whenever you want.
L150882 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You'll always play with me?
L150881 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Oh, I like the sound of that.., Amy and her friend... Amy and her friend.
L150880 +++$+++ u4722 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
L150879 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
L150878 +++$+++ u4722 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
L150877 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I shall want you for always.
L150876 +++$+++ u4722 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ For as long as you'll let me.
L150875 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Will you be friend for always?
L150874 +++$+++ u4722 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ I can not tell you.
L150873 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ But where is that?
L150872 +++$+++ u4722 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
L150871 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ But where do you come from?
L150870 +++$+++ u4722 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
L150869 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I've wanted a friend.
L150868 +++$+++ u4722 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ I'm your friend.
L150867 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Irena. But who are you?
L150866 +++$+++ u4722 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ You called me by my name.
L150865 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Who are you?
L151020 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ But where has it gone?  Where's all the strength and the quickness?
L151019 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ It got hit.
L151018 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ But it was alive — it was fast and strong!
L151017 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Because it can't. It's dead.
L151016 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
L151015 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
L151014 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ But what happened to the little deer?
L151013 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Bad luck to see death in the snow.
L151012 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
L151011 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.
L150986 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ It's a hard winter. All the animals are bold as brass, coming down into the streets for food. You'll see a lot of deer this winter.
L150985 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ There was a deer on the other side of the fence.
L150830 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ But I don't want you coming here alone. You get me to go with you when you want to come here. You promise?
L150829 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ But she's such a nice lady.
L150828 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
L150813 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ But Mrs. Farren just started to tell me a story. Please.
L150812 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ About time for you to come home, Amy.
L150747 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ That means I can go alone?
L150746 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
L150745 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
L150744 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Soon as I finish.
L150743 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Will you come soon?
L150742 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
L150741 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
L150740 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Little miss, you're stopping me in my work.
L150708 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Oh, I suppose it was to the wind you sang, or maybe to the sun, or the clouds, or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden.
L150707 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I wasn't singing to myself.
L150697 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Let me take another look at that ring.
L150696 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I'm trying to.
L150695 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Been crying? That won't please your Daddy. You'd bettor cheer yourself up.
L150658 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ That's the clever way to do it.
L150657 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
L150656 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ They're given to the living in memory of the dead.  If this is a real one -- I can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
L150655 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
L150654 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
L150653 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
L150652 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I wouldn't be surprised if it were a true wishing ring.
L150651 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ It's a pretty ring.
L150650 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
L150649 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ A lady threw it to me.
L150648 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ That's a fine-looking ring.
L150647 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Look at my ring.
L150559 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Mommy's taking me upstairs to change my dress right away.
L150558 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Getting the yard all fixed up for your party, Amy. You'd better hurry and get yourself fixed up too.
L151116 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ I can't do it! I can't do it!
L151115 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Hurry!
L151114 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ Yes, yes -
L151113 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Hurry, hurry.
L151110 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you.
L151109 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Hide me? Why?
L151005 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ No, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. They too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.
L151004 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ And does he kill people?
L151002 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ Don't you read Shakespeare?
L151001 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Who's Herne the Huntsman?
L150998 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ Don't you hear it?
L150997 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ What?
L150989 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
L150988 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
L150817 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ Good.
L150816 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren. He'll let me stay.
L150809 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ It was shot off long ago in the great battles that were fought here; with the British on one side and the Americans on the other.
L150808 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Why hasn't he got a head?
L150807 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ The Headless Horseman --
L150804 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ Do you know the story of "The Headless Horseman?"
L150803 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Mommy read it to ne.
L150802 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ Then I'll tell you a story — a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
L150801 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I like stories.
L150799 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ One little piece of cake won't hurt you. Go ahead, take one. It's full of fruit...citron, cherries and ginger. It'll make you dream. Yes, wonderful dreams.
L150798 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ No, thank you.
L150797 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
L150796 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ That woman is an imposter, a liar, and a cheat. How do you like your tea? </PRE><PRE>                                AMY Well... .sometimes I got a spoonful of tea in a cup of hot milk.
L150795 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Who is she?
L150794 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me — always!
L150792 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
L150791 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ But I only came to give back the ring.
L150790 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days — those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
L150789 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
L150788 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ Return it to me? Indeed you may not. I gave it to you as a present.
L150787 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
L150786 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
L151106 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ Good night...Barbara...
L151105 +++$+++ u4720 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Good night, mother, good night.
L151104 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ I'll not see her, Barbara. I promise.
L151103 +++$+++ u4720 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
L151102 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
L151101 +++$+++ u4720 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.
L151099 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ Yes. Yes, Barbara, I shan't forget.
L151098 +++$+++ u4720 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a dream. Promise me.
L151096 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ Yes, Barbara... Barbara...
L151095 +++$+++ u4720 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Mother! You called me by name!
L151092 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ It was pale...a shadowed gold.
L151091 +++$+++ u4720 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
L151090 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ Yes...yes, that's true.
L151089 +++$+++ u4720 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
L151088 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
L151087 +++$+++ u4720 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have?
L151086 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ Anybody could know that song.
L151085 +++$+++ u4720 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?
L151076 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ My Barbara was killed. I killed her. Yes, it was my fault. Everyone told me not to drive from the theatre. There was a raging wind that night, and snow and ice. All was well until we got to the Sleepy Hollow bridge. Barbara was singing a little song and then ...I don't know how it happened ..when I awakened, they told me the car was overturned, and they wouldn't let me see Barbara. Barbara was dead.
L151075 +++$+++ u4720 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
L151074 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
L151073 +++$+++ u4720 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I hate the storm. I hate it!
L151010 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ My daughter died long ago.
L151009 +++$+++ u4720 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.
L150834 +++$+++ u4720 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Look at me.
L150833 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ My daughter, Barbara, died when she was six. That was long ago. You're only the woman who keeps care of me. I know you.
L151007 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
L151006 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.
L151000 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ 
L150999 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ What is it, ma'am?
L150996 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ Wait a minute. Listen.
L150995 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ It's some animal hurt in the woods that made that sound.
L150991 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ That's from her -- that woman.
L150990 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ There's a present you haven't opened yet, ma'am.
L150822 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Come away, Amy.
L150821 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ ...At the hour of midnight, down the road that goes through Sleepy Hollow, across the bridge, he goes galloping, galloping, always searching, always seeking
L150820 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Little miss, you can't stay here. You've got to come with me.
L150819 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ On the dark nights — on the stormy nights -- you can hear him. He passes like the wind; The flapping and fluttering of his great cloak beating like gaunt wings. The thunder of his horse's hooves is loud, loud and louder, beating hard, beating strong on the frozen ground as he comes riding, riding, riding.
L150815 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Now, I don't know Amy --
L150814 +++$+++ u4725 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MRS. FARREN +++$+++ Let the child stay.
L150916 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Good heavens! What could you be giving me. Little Miss?
L150915 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ "To Daddy from Amy." Here's one for Miss Callahan. This one says, "To Edward from Amy.".
L150706 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Indeed I did. Up and down the garden she went, laughing and singing to herself.
L150705 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
L150704 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I didn't even have to coax her tonight.
L150702 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ So do I, Mr. Reed.
L150701 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ I like to see her happy.
L150700 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Amy looks happy — seems almost as if she were playing with another child; like somebody else were running with her and playing.
L150591 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ She pleaded so to do it
L150590 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ And Amy mailed them?
L150589 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post.
L150569 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Go on -- out with you.
L150568 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
L150565 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Got more leaf mold now than we'll ever need, Mr. Reed.  I thought I'd burn 'em up and get the yard clean.
L150564 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ I thought we were going to save those leaves you were burning for the compost bin.
L150563 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ I imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the Seventh National Bank of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party.
L150562 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
L150561 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
L150560 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Everything all right down there at the school, Mr. Reed?
L151066 +++$+++ u4724 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MISS CALLAHAN +++$+++ Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
L151065 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
L151060 +++$+++ u4724 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MISS CALLAHAN +++$+++ She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind.
L151059 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
L151058 +++$+++ u4724 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MISS CALLAHAN +++$+++ But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
L151057 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ She refuses to deny it. She continues to believe in her lies.
