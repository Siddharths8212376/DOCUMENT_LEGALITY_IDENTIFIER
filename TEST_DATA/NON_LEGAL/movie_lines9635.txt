L111378 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Please, I've got to find Jill.
L111377 +++$+++ u4237 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ HELPMANN +++$+++ Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
L111376 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
L111375 +++$+++ u4237 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ HELPMANN +++$+++ Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
L111374 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
L111373 +++$+++ u4237 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ HELPMANN +++$+++ I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me.
L111372 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Help me!
L111371 +++$+++ u4237 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ HELPMANN +++$+++ I understand, Sam, I know exactly how you feel. So I brought you a bottle of barley water.
L111370 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.
L111369 +++$+++ u4237 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ HELPMANN +++$+++ Gillian Layton?
L111368 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
L111367 +++$+++ u4237 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ HELPMANN +++$+++ Sam, what are we going to do with you? Can you hear me, Sam?
L110942 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Well ... well, I ...
L110941 +++$+++ u4237 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ HELPMANN +++$+++ Too late? That's for me to say.
L110940 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
L110939 +++$+++ u4237 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ HELPMANN +++$+++ I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ...
L110937 +++$+++ u4237 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ HELPMANN +++$+++ Your father and I were very close. Of course Jeremiah was senior to me but we were close friends ... especially after the bombing  and I  keep his name alive at the office every day.
L110936 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Sorry ...
L110935 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Well, I ...
L110934 +++$+++ u4237 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ HELPMANN +++$+++ If I can help you ...
L110933 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to help.
L110932 +++$+++ u4237 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ HELPMANN +++$+++ Thanks very much Sam.
L111399 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Shut up! This is a professional relationship!
L111398 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Jack ...
L111397 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ How do you think I feel? You shit!
L111396 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
L111395 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ How could you do this to me?
L111394 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What?
L111393 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You stupid bastard!
L111392 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ This is all a mistake. Jack, please take that mask off.
L111391 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Bastard!!!
L111390 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
L111389 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Shut up!
L111388 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Jack?... Jack?
L111275 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, could you stay away from me until this thing blows over.
L111274 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yes we have, Jack!
L111273 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
L111272 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Jack, she's innocent!
L111271 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them.  This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. Bye bye.
L111270 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ It could all be coincidental.
L111269 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I do. Goodbye. 
L111268 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
L111267 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon. Listen, we've also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye.
L111266 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong.
L111265 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
L111264 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
L111087 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Sam ... we're proud to have you at Information Retrieval. Merry Xmas. 
L111086 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Trust me.
L111085 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Do you know what you're doing.
L111084 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
L111083 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Er ... alright. For Christ's sake don't lose it. Here, you'd better sign for it.
L111082 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
L111081 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ We don't make mistakes.
L111080 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Say it was a mistake.
L111079 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
L111078 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Take her off the list.
L111077 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ But, I've already put her on the search and detain list.
L111076 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ They weren't at school with us.
L111075 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
L111074 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
L111073 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You're the only person I can trust.
L111072 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ And you're mine.
L111071 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
L111070 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
L111069 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
L111068 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
L111067 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
L111066 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
L111065 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
L111064 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ So what are you going to do about her?
L111063 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
L111062 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Out of kindness.
L111061 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ {baffled) I don't follow you.
L111060 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
L111059 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Why?
L111058 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.
L111057 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
L111056 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
L111055 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
L111054 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
L111052 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ A terrorist?
L111051 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
L111050 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Tell me about Layton.
L111049 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yes. I'm impressed.
L111048 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
L111047 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Very smart.
L111046 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Er ... no.
L111045 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
L111044 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What's she done?
L111043 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ He's a compulsive heating engineer. A maverick ex-Central Service repair man with a grudge against society. Now, fortunately, we're nearly out of the wood, I think. At least we will be when I get this Layton woman under arrest.
L111042 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ He's a freelance subversive?
L111041 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ We suspect him of freelance subversion.
L111040 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What has Tuttle done?
L111039 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
L111038 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ So how ...?
L111037 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
L111036 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm sure you have
L111035 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
L111034 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You killed him?
L111033 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
L111032 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You got the wrong man.
L111031 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
L111030 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
L111029 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Christ! You do know it all!
L111028 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
L111027 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ OK. OK. Let's not fence around ... This is the situation. Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215.
L111026 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Not really, no.
L111025 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Enough though, eh?
L111024 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Not much.
L111023 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ How much do you know?
L111022 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ How do you mean?
L111021 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
L111020 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Am I?
L111019 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
L111018 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What is it?
L111017 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Layton! Oh shit!
L111016 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
L111015 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.
L111014 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you.
L111013 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What?
L111012 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Ah ...
L111011 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight?
L111010 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yes, thanks.
L111009 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
L111008 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
L111007 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Sorry about that ... Mr Helpmann told me you were coming aboard - congratulations!
L111006 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Are you officer 412/L?
L111005 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ SAM! What a surprise!
L111004 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Jack!!
L110925 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Mr Helpmann!
L110924 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false.
L110923 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Dr. Jaffe has pinned her ears back.
L110920 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to wonder if they were real.
L110919 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Remember how they used to stick out?
L110918 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Er, I knew you looked different.
L110917 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ {winking at Sam) She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.
L110913 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You remember Alison?
L110912 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hello, Jack!
L110551 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Really? - God, how time flies!
L110550 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Triplets.
L110549 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins.
L110548 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed -
L110547 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Even later.
L110546 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You are late.
L110545 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Sorry. Nothing.  See you - I'm going to be late.
L110544 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What's the matter?
L110543 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Me? - if I'm worried about anyone, it's you. What happened to you, Sam? You were the brightest of us -
L110542 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You sound worried.
L110541 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
L110540 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
L110539 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Long time no see!
L110538 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Jack!
L110537 +++$+++ u4239 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Sam!
L111104 +++$+++ u4240 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Well don't. You're looking at twenty pounds of high explosive! And if you don't stamp this form I'm going to blow the place up!
L111103 +++$+++ u4248 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ Oh.
L111102 +++$+++ u4240 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ I bet you'd like to touch them?
L111101 +++$+++ u4248 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ Ah.
L111100 +++$+++ u4240 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ You think these are tits don't you?
L111099 +++$+++ u4248 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ If you say so.
L111098 +++$+++ u4240 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
L111089 +++$+++ u4248 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ You've just said yourself, Miss, we've already stamped it. Why should we stamp it twice?
L111088 +++$+++ u4240 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now?
L110561 +++$+++ u4248 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ Information Adjustments.
L110560 +++$+++ u4240 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Where do I get it stamped?
L110559 +++$+++ u4248 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
L110558 +++$+++ u4240 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Stamped?
L110557 +++$+++ u4248 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ Is it stamped?
L110556 +++$+++ u4240 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Yes.
L110555 +++$+++ u4248 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
L110554 +++$+++ u4240 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
L110553 +++$+++ u4248 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
L110552 +++$+++ u4240 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ I want to report a wrongful arrest.
L111336 +++$+++ u4249 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You don't exist any more. I've killed you. Jill Layton is dead.
L111335 +++$+++ u4240 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ What do you think? ... is it me?
L111323 +++$+++ u4240 +++$+++ m283 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Take care.
