L410943 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
L410942 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
L410941 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
L410940 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
L410939 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Eh.
L410938 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Five-- Six--
L410937 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ How many times have I fired her?
L410932 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.
L410931 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Well, excuse me for caring about words.
L410930 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.
L410929 +++$+++ u6858 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.
L411723 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ You said that already.
L411722 +++$+++ u6859 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
L411721 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Oh.
L411720 +++$+++ u6859 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ My sword.
L411719 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?
L411718 +++$+++ u6859 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ Hey--what are you thinking about?
L411689 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
L411688 +++$+++ u6859 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ You having fun?
L411617 +++$+++ u6859 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ Cool. I'll catch you later.
L411616 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
L411615 +++$+++ u6859 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ Rufus.  But I don't even know where you live.
L411614 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Yes. I'll go. Yes.
L411613 +++$+++ u6859 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ I'm sure you've probably heard that I want to ask you, but I'd like to know if you'd go to prom with me. I know we Didn't hit it off right at the beginning but-
L411610 +++$+++ u6859 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
L411609 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Maybe we should go in a different room?
L411603 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Hey. There.
L411602 +++$+++ u6859 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ Hey there.
L411577 +++$+++ u6859 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ Yeah, you gonna be there?
L411576 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Rob's?
L411430 +++$+++ u6859 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ Dude, you rock!
L411429 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Oh my god.
L411157 +++$+++ u6859 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ Are you in special ed?
L411156 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed.  Yikes.  Bikes!
L411598 +++$+++ u6867 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ I'm Rob's prom date.
L411597 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Hey Rob, what's going on?
L411540 +++$+++ u6867 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ But I'm not a penguin.
L411539 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
L411538 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
L411537 +++$+++ u6867 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
L411536 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
L411535 +++$+++ u6867 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ God, I can't do this.
L411775 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No, shut up, Josie. Just shut up.
L411774 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I-
L411773 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
L411772 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ wasn't even thinking about-
L411771 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me?  I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age.
L411770 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Really?
L411769 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
L411668 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I know.
L411667 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
L411666 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Duh. Tom Cruise. "Risky Business".
L411665 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Thanks. And what are -
L411664 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
L411663 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Rufus?
L411662 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Wow, Josie- you look really-
L411601 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ She's sixteen years old, Rob. That's totally and completely illegal.
L411600 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ And a gymnast!
L411599 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen.
L411427 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Hear one.  Rob, this is so like you. You know, you can't just come in here and be popular in just one day.
L411426 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
L411425 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ You're twenty-three years old!
L411424 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
L411423 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Are you crazy?! You can't do this.
L411419 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No. Josie, this is real.
L411418 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.
L411331 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ That's the spirit!
L411330 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Better than I...
L411329 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
L411328 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Yes, desperately.
L411327 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
L411326 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Little known fact.
L411325 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Is that true?
L411324 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
L411323 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
L411322 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.
L411321 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Rob. Please focus.
L411320 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
L411319 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South.
L411318 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Why is that impossible?
L411317 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
L411316 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
L411315 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I can't do this.
L411314 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No, I mean, no big whoop.
L411311 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Good.
L411310 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
L411309 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Are mom and dad here?
L411062 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God.
L411061 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
L411060 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Josie Grossie.
L411057 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Don't you remember what they called you?
L411056 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ It was a long time ago -
L411055 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Do you remember high school?
L411054 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ What!?
L411053 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
L411052 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Wow. This must be big.
L411050 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre.
L411049 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
L411048 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ It's just for a couple of months.
L411003 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life!
L411002 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
L411001 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
L411000 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
L410999 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
L410998 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
L410997 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
L410996 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ See!
L410995 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Better person than I.
L410994 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
L410993 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
L410991 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Because I bought the windshield last week. I'm a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do.
L410990 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ She just needs a new windshield wiper.
L410989 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
L410988 +++$+++ u6864 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No it's not. Guys name their penises.
L410987 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ That is so--weird that you name your car.
L411836 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I finally found my story.
L411835 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
L411768 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I just can't look at you the same way.
L411767 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Please. Please don't walk away.
L411766 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.
L411765 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
L411764 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
L411763 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
L411762 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ But now you don't have to--
L411761 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
L411760 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Wait, I was going to tell you--
L411759 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
L411758 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ You were attracted to me?
L411757 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
L411756 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
L411755 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ "Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
L411737 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Yeah, I have.
L411736 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
L411734 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?
L411733 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No, I'm alone.
L411732 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Well, are you here with anybody?
L411731 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Proms always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on.
L411725 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Thanks. So do you.
L411724 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
L411652 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Of course I do. Josie, you owe it to yourself--to your writing, to go to college. You're a great writer. You just have to find your story.
L411651 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Wow. You believe in me that much--
L411650 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
L411649 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Oh--yikes!
L411648 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
L411647 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
L411646 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
L411645 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yeah, actually I do.
L411644 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Do you think you'll find her?
L411643 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Our penguin, right?
L411642 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ To put us back together again when we fall.
L411641 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
L411640 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
L411639 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
L411638 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
L411637 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
L411636 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
L411635 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.
L411489 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm thinking when I'm home.
L411488 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ When are you going to open your eyes?
L411487 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought.
L411486 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
L411485 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ You have to say that. You're my teacher.
L411482 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--
L411481 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
L411480 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Why do you do that?
L411479 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
L411478 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I know.
L411477 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Boys.
L411475 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ I don't have to say that.
L411474 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You have to say that. You're my student.
L411473 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
L411472 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
L411471 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
L411470 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Okay This is okay. Smooth.  Can I ask you something? Do you think I tell too many stories in class?
L411467 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Don't look down!
L411466 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yoooooow.
L411465 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Of course. I remember everything from your class.
L411464 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You remember that story?
L411463 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
L411462 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
L411461 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
L411460 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
L411459 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Are you--scared?
L411457 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Thank you.
L411456 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ This seat taken?
L411358 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Josie, you're different. When you speak in class, I can tell--You actually feel the words--  in here. They're alive. Like-Eurdora Welty talked about the word it moon"? How for her it was like a Concord grape. "That Grandpa took off his vine and gave to me to suck out of its skin--"
L411357 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
L411356 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
L411355 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.
L411354 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
L411353 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ College. Haven't really thought about it.
L411352 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ So what are you thinking for college?
L411351 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Thank you.
L411350 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
L411349 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Oh I don't think so.
L411348 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hey, Josie, hold on.  You've been hiding something from me.
L411262 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Well, I'm definitely seventeen and  now definitely late--
L411261 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.
L411260 +++$+++ u6860 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ JOSIE +++$+++ Sure, why?
L411259 +++$+++ u6865 +++$+++ m458 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
