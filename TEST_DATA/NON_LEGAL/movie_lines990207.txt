L447137 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out.
L447136 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I understand.  Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
L447135 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
L447134 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
L447133 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ We've done that.  He's a San Francisco private eye.  Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E.  Had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it.  Goble and Greer is the firm name.
L447132 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ You told me when we'd identified this fellow--
L447131 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
L447130 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ Got a moment, Inspector?
L447035 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ I'm an Irishman, sir.  An Irishman is always logical.
L447034 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ And don't get too logical, Driscoll. In police business it doesn't work. I wish it did.  But it doesn't
L447033 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Let me know when you've identified him
L447032 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
L447031 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
L447030 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
L447029 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
L447028 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ Not a floater.  Only just dead.
L447027 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Floater?
L447026 +++$+++ u7092 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ DRISCOLL +++$+++ The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.
L446972 +++$+++ u7096 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MAGRUDER +++$+++ When you sign for it, you count it.  It's your dough.
L446971 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ Open it and count it.
L446970 +++$+++ u7096 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MAGRUDER +++$+++ I need a receipt.  Sign your name across the flap.
L446969 +++$+++ u7096 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MAGRUDER +++$+++ Sounds like a fair swap.  Let's take a look.
L446968 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ You get it's brother.
L446967 +++$+++ u7096 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MAGRUDER +++$+++ What do I get for it?
L446966 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
L446965 +++$+++ u7096 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MAGRUDER +++$+++ Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
L446964 +++$+++ u7096 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MAGRUDER +++$+++ Talk English.  How do I know you're you?
L446963 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
L446962 +++$+++ u7096 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MAGRUDER +++$+++ Go live in a tent.
L446961 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
L446960 +++$+++ u7096 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MAGRUDER +++$+++ The joint's not open, Mac.  Who's Brandon?
L446959 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.
L447341 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ A think wire---but very, very strong.  Let's get out of here.
L447340 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ Greer and Goble in the Call Building, San Francisco.  Just like you thought...Two murders in two days.  Different places, different methods, different people. Nothing connects them, but a telephone number.
L447338 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ And a motive--which we haven't got.  So this could all be a dream.
L447337 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
L447336 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Did we ever really think it was suicide?
L447335 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ No suicide.
L447334 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
L447333 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
L447332 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.
L447331 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ How did he know he'd get the chance? He couldn't have arranged it.
L447330 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ I've got to find a way to handle it, openly.  Like Brandon.
L447329 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ So?
L447328 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
L447327 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Well.  What about it?
L447326 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ This is the shell.  What about the gun?
L447322 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You've got a dead man on your hands. Like this.
L447321 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ Pretty big chance, huh?
L447320 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
L447319 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ Do I know that she's out of the room?  Likely to be out of it for some time?
L447318 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You can find out.
L447317 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ Do I know who lives down there?
L447316 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble.  What do I do?  What would you do?
L447315 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ Such as?
L447314 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Exactly.  Now I'm the killer.  And there's something I don't want you to know.  Something that would destroy my comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position.
L447313 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people.  I'd want to know just about everything about them.
L447312 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
L447311 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
L447310 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?
L447307 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ Should be over there.
L447306 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Where's the shell?
L447305 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ I think so.
L447304 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Was that about the right angle?
L447301 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ There wasn't any motive...let's try out the act.
L447300 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
L447299 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Not too hard, is it?
L447297 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
L447296 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ That's pretty risky business, Inspector.
L447280 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Market... It seems to me that's a San Francisco exchange.
L447279 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
L447278 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ "G.G. Market one-eight-four-two."
L447276 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ I guess I'm just ballast around here.
L447275 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I'll know when I find it.
L447274 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ She didn't seem the type to lam out--even if she got the chance. That stuff was all gone through last night.  Anything special you're looking for, Inspector?
L446691 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I've always looked forward to it. All right, let's get him out of here and tidy up.
L446690 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.
L446689 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
L446688 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ Unless the gun was slanted up.
L446687 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ So the shell ought to have gone over?
L446686 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ This make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the wall.
L446682 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ Correct, Inspector. A woman's gun. U.S. 125 caliber ammunition in it. It was on a table in there.
L446681 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Pearl-handled .25 Automatic, uh?  No, it's a Belgian gun... 6.6 mm.
L446680 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ It's her room. She only got to the Hotel this afternoon,. With him.  I guess he took too much for granted. Here's the gun.
L446679 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I've met her.
L446678 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ ... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector.
L446677 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ They tell me he'll be a great loss to the liquor trade. This Mayfield girl...
L446676 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I knew him. He was easy to dislike, poor chap.
L446675 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I hate to pull rank on you Sergeant, but once in a while...for moral purposes...you might address me as "Inspector". In moments of extreme desperation, you might even call me "sir".
L446674 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ Right.
L446673 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ So it seems Sergeant.
L446672 +++$+++ u7094 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GORE +++$+++ You in charge here?
L447002 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You would still have planted information that Clarendon knew about the gun--and not as an accusation, but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession.  Very neat.  Good morning, Mrs. West.
L447001 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ And if you didn't believe me?
L447000 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Sure.  You didn't come here in person just to tell me about the gun.  You wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about Mitchell.  If I believe you, it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night.
L446999 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Now, you're being beastly.
L446998 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
L446997 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I don't understand.
L446996 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
L446995 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ It does.  May I go now? 
L446994 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Not if it clears the air.
L446993 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
L446992 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Mortar shells are not funny, either.
L446991 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Did you ever have a serious operation?
L446990 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You didn't play it for laughs last night.
L446989 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
L446988 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
L446987 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I am a fool.
L446986 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
L446985 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.
L446984 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag.
L446983 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
L446982 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ How did you know?  Clarendon.  You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.
L446981 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Remember that time, didn't I? Good morning Mrs. West.  Does your visit here mean you've changed your mind?
L446724 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Thank you very much, Mrs. West.
L446723 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
L446722 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
L446721 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
L446720 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
L446719 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
L446718 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?
L446717 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Not quiet yet.
L446716 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ What about me?
L446702 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Positive?
L446701 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I never saw it before.
L446526 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Warm water, no doubt.
L446525 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Scotch and plain water, I think.
L446517 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Are you always this witty?
L446516 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Oh nothing.
L446515 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ May you what?
L446512 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
L446511 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
L447398 +++$+++ u7104 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ TECHNICIAN +++$+++ Brandon handled the money envelope.
L447397 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ The card says so, doesn't it?
L447396 +++$+++ u7104 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ TECHNICIAN +++$+++ This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
L447392 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I'll take your word.
L447391 +++$+++ u7104 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ TECHNICIAN +++$+++ You'll have to take my word for it.  We don't make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison.
L447390 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ She might.
L447389 +++$+++ u7104 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ TECHNICIAN +++$+++ Mayfield?  She fit into this?
L447388 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
L447387 +++$+++ u7104 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ TECHNICIAN +++$+++ So far.
L447386 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ That leaves two strangers.
L447385 +++$+++ u7104 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ TECHNICIAN +++$+++ He checks too.
L447384 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ How about Magruder?
L447383 +++$+++ u7104 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ TECHNICIAN +++$+++ No doubt about that one.
L447381 +++$+++ u7104 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ TECHNICIAN +++$+++ Four different people, Inspector. Three men and a women.  I've made slides for two.  They handled both envelopes.
L447380 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I'm interested in who handled it.
L447379 +++$+++ u7104 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ TECHNICIAN +++$+++ Yes, I think so.  Here are two glazed manila envelopes.  One is the bag type.  The other one had the money in it.  Don't ask me how I know.  I know.
L447126 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ You think I'm wrong about this bit of a girl.  Go out and prove it against me!
L447125 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ What are my orders, sir?
L447124 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ Get out of here!
L447123 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ This badge is not an old newspaper you can cast down on the desk.  It is not a thing you can give up as of no value.  It may be taken from you--and you may die defending it. But you'll not use it to make cheap dramatic gesures with.  It's a naked steel of the sword of Justice.  Put it back in your pocket and hold tight to it--and someday you might grow into a worthiness ye lack now.
L447122 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Not too far, I hope.
L447121 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ You're a young man.  You're romantic.  You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart.  You'll grow out of that.
L447120 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
L447119 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ There are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor.  I'm not one of them.
L447118 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Two.
L447117 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ I believe you won decorations during the war.
L447115 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I do.
L447114 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ But you still think she's innocent.
L447113 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
L447112 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ "Physical description: Age 26, Height 5  1 3/4 inches: Weight, 188 pounds: Light brown hair: Deep blue eyes: Small, perfectly formed features: Ears and earlobes small: Slender build: Wears size 4 AA shoe: Quiet refined manner: New York accent: No charges pending. No prior criminal record.  Mayfield, Mother's name.  Air-mailing you photographs today.  Signed Hubert Tollison, Chief of Police, Greenwater, North Carolina."  She bleached her hair, or course.  Would your sensibilities be offended, if I sent out a general alarm to pick up this girl?
L447111 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ "Superintendent J. McKechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Replying your inquiry Elizabeth Kinsolving.  Subject was indicted, first degree murder her husband, Lee Kinsolving, January this year. Guilty verdict set aside by presiding judge.  Prisoner discharged, Whereabouts now unknown. Fingerprint classification"--  And exact correspondence, Killaine.
L447110 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
L447109 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ "Superintendent J. Mckechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Vancouver B.c. Replaying To Your E.P. teletype classification No. 2684 incomplete.  We advise identification possible.  Elizabeth Kinsolving, arrested Greenwater, North Carolina, January 8, 1948, on a charge of murder.  Signed, FBI., Washington, D.C. H. Cleary, Inspector in charge."  Have ye any comment, Killaine?
L447108 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L447107 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?
L447106 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
L447105 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ Ye have, have ye?
L447104 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
L447103 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ This girl is a murderess, Killaine.
L447102 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.
L447101 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
L447100 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I don't know, sir.
L447099 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine.  Where's the girl now?
L447098 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
L447097 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
L447021 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ When I give an order, you'll not need it interpreted.  You have an hour to make your mind up.  Well, are ye satisfied, Mr. Mitchell?
L447020 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Am I to interpret that as an order to arrest Miss Mayfield?
L447017 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ Aye.  You have a point there.
L447016 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
L447015 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ I hear she's a very pretty girl.
L447014 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ No.
L447011 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ She's the only one who had a dead man in her room.  The only one who won't give an account of herself. The only one who tried to run away. And the only one, so far, I've been told, who went to such lengths to disguise her identity that she even removed the labels from her clothes.  What more do you want?
L447010 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.
L447009 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ I've explained the situation to Mr. Mitchell up to a point.  Now about this Mayfield girl?
L447008 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ How do you do, sir.
L447007 +++$+++ u7100 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MCKECHNIE +++$+++ Killaine, this is Mr. Mitchell, Senior.  Young Mitchell's father. He just flew in from Toronto.
L446548 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Unsophisticated?  If I knew about this babe...
L446547 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.
L446537 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I say YES!
L446536 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ She is beautiful. And young.  No thank you.
L446535 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ In that case, there's someone here I'd like to introduce to you. Over there.
L446534 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I have no intension of being nasty, Mr. Mitchell.
L446533 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Be nasty.
L446532 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
L446531 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.
L446406 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ In an hour, Larry.
L446405 +++$+++ u7101 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Right.
L446404 +++$+++ u7099 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
