L626573 +++$+++ u3367 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ I followed you here from court.
L626572 +++$+++ u3363 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ MRS. ESPARZA +++$+++ -- What trial?
L626571 +++$+++ u3367 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?
L626570 +++$+++ u3367 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ I'm Roger Baron. I work with Edward Dowd.
L626569 +++$+++ u3363 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ MRS. ESPARZA +++$+++ What do you want?
L626532 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ You mean to say Mr. Kim told you that he murdered Jimmy Chin?
L626531 +++$+++ u3365 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ ORTEGA +++$+++ Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
L626530 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ And why was an exception made?
L626529 +++$+++ u3365 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ ORTEGA +++$+++ Shu's the only one I know of...
L626528 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ Isn't it unusual for an Asian to be accepted into a Cuban prison gang?
L626527 +++$+++ u3365 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ ORTEGA +++$+++ Soldado.
L626526 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ Mr. Ortega, what is Shu Kai Kim's rank within La Compania?
L626525 +++$+++ u3365 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ ORTEGA +++$+++ That's right.
L626524 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
L626523 +++$+++ u3365 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ ORTEGA +++$+++ ...A soldado, he takes care of it.
L626522 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ If a member of the Aryan Brothers tries to cut in on your distribution?
L626521 +++$+++ u3365 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ ORTEGA +++$+++ Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack...
L626520 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ "Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
L626519 +++$+++ u3365 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ ORTEGA +++$+++ A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
L626518 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
L626517 +++$+++ u3365 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ ORTEGA +++$+++ I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
L626516 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ "Name, rank and serial," Mr. Ortega. Let's not hide behind the Fifth.
L626515 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ What is your rank within La Compania?
L626514 +++$+++ u3365 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ ORTEGA +++$+++ Yeah, we do some of that.
L626513 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ Do the rival gangs compete for control of the prison drug trade?
L626508 +++$+++ u3365 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ ORTEGA +++$+++ I would tend to plead the Fifth.
L626507 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ For control of the prison drug trade?
L626506 +++$+++ u3365 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ ORTEGA +++$+++ Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
L626505 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ And its purpose?
L626504 +++$+++ u3365 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ ORTEGA +++$+++ A Cubano army, basically... inside and outside prisons.
L626503 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
L626502 +++$+++ u3365 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ ORTEGA +++$+++ Five years.
L626500 +++$+++ u3365 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ ORTEGA +++$+++ I would tend to plead the Fifth.
L626499 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ Mr. Ortega, you've known the defendant at Ossining Correctional for how long?
L626063 +++$+++ u3370 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ STIPE +++$+++ And you b-believe that.
L626062 +++$+++ u3367 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ The phone company was broken up.
L626061 +++$+++ u3370 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ STIPE +++$+++ Telephone.  I suppose you don't know the phone company killed Kennedy because he was trying to b-break it up -- and they'll never let that happen. They control everything: what you say in the mouthpiece is never exactly what comes out the other end, and --
L626060 +++$+++ u3367 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ CIA?
L626055 +++$+++ u3370 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ STIPE +++$+++ No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
L626054 +++$+++ u3367 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ I think what Eddie wants to say is --
L626052 +++$+++ u3370 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ STIPE +++$+++ That guy they arrested -- he was the wrong g-guy.
L626051 +++$+++ u3367 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?
L626050 +++$+++ u3370 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ STIPE +++$+++ You're a l-lawyer?  I... I haven't had my meds, or m-my vital signs t-taken yet. I...
L630743 +++$+++ u3378 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ She is preparing a great abundance of food.
L630742 +++$+++ u3371 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
L630741 +++$+++ u3378 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
L630740 +++$+++ u3371 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ Tell me some other things about her.
L630739 +++$+++ u3378 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ Blonde.
L630738 +++$+++ u3371 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ What color hair will she have?
L630737 +++$+++ u3378 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ A woman.
L630736 +++$+++ u3371 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
L630735 +++$+++ u3378 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ Yes. Either right now or right when I thought of it. The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me. Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. Because it is only a feeling, I am powerless to stop it. And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it.
L630734 +++$+++ u3371 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ You said, "Teresa Banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?
L630733 +++$+++ u3378 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ Albert.
L630732 +++$+++ u3371 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
L630731 +++$+++ u3378 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
L630730 +++$+++ u3371 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. Do you honestly think Cole's practice of word association works?
L631132 +++$+++ u3372 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ BOB'S VOICE +++$+++ I want you to kill for me.
L631131 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
L631130 +++$+++ u3372 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ BOB'S VOICE +++$+++ I want you to kill for me.
L631129 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ No.
L631039 +++$+++ u3372 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ BOB'S VOICE +++$+++ I am the One who wants to breathe thru your nose and taste thru your mouth.
L631038 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
L631037 +++$+++ u3372 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ BOB'S VOICE +++$+++ That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.
L630942 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ NO! GOD, NO...
L630941 +++$+++ u3372 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ BOB'S VOICE +++$+++ SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?
L630857 +++$+++ u3372 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ BOB'S VOICE +++$+++ I want you.
L630856 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Go away. I am not talking to you.
L630855 +++$+++ u3372 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ BOB'S VOICE +++$+++ I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.
L630854 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ No... No, go away.
L631179 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Thanks, Bobby.  And my little round friends, too.
L631178 +++$+++ u3373 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Bobby's got it.
L631175 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Bobby...
L631174 +++$+++ u3373 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ We can do it right here.
L631172 +++$+++ u3373 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Why? Why not? Where are you goin'?
L631171 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
L631170 +++$+++ u3373 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Let's ditch this place and party.
L631169 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
L631168 +++$+++ u3373 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
L631167 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
L631166 +++$+++ u3373 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Don't get funny with me again.
L631165 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
L631164 +++$+++ u3373 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.
L631163 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
L631162 +++$+++ u3373 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ The stuff we got last night.
L631161 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ What was?
L631160 +++$+++ u3373 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.
L631134 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You killed Mike.
L631133 +++$+++ u3373 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Babe, I'm on my way out to the woods to divvy up the product. Put this cash in your safety deposit box...  It's ten thousand dollars.
L631127 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
L631126 +++$+++ u3373 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?
L631116 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Here he comes.
L631115 +++$+++ u3373 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Here he comes.
L631045 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Don't be late.
L631044 +++$+++ u3373 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
L631043 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
L631042 +++$+++ u3373 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
L631041 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I'm nearly out.
L630650 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your smiles.
L630649 +++$+++ u3373 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
L630648 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Get lost Bobby.
L630647 +++$+++ u3373 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'M NOT KIDDIN'. WHERE WERE YOU? WHO WERE YOU WITH?
L630646 +++$+++ u3390 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I was right behind you, but you're too dumb to turn around.  If he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down.
L630645 +++$+++ u3373 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Where were you for the last hour? I've been lookin' for you?
L630487 +++$+++ u3374 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ My alibi is as strong as these bands of steel.
L630486 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
L630485 +++$+++ u3374 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
L630484 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
L630483 +++$+++ u3374 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
L630482 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
L630481 +++$+++ u3374 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.
L630354 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.
L630353 +++$+++ u3374 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ It's 4:30. We close at five.
L630352 +++$+++ u3374 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ Out back in our morgue.
L630351 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
L630350 +++$+++ u3374 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ A basic kill. Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. My boys have been all over this. It's a dead end.
L630349 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Well, little fella, let me put it this way. The operative word here would be "Federal". With or without the semantics of all this, I am now ordering you to release all pertinent information concerning Teresa Banks, both while living and deceased.
L630348 +++$+++ u3374 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ You're lucky I am not wasting you.
L630347 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
L630346 +++$+++ u3374 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I think I said, "So what?"
L630345 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ I'm here to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks.
L630541 +++$+++ u3375 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Yep, it sure is.
L630540 +++$+++ u3378 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
L630539 +++$+++ u3375 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Chalfont. Weird. Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. Two Chalfonts.
L630538 +++$+++ u3378 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ Can you tell me what their names were?
L630537 +++$+++ u3375 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ An old woman and her grandson.
L630536 +++$+++ u3378 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
L630535 +++$+++ u3375 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
L630534 +++$+++ u3378 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ What was here, Mr. Rodd?
L630533 +++$+++ u3375 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ God damn, you people are confusing.
L630532 +++$+++ u3378 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ I am going over here.
L630531 +++$+++ u3375 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Well, where are you going?
L630530 +++$+++ u3378 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
L630529 +++$+++ u3375 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ That's not the way to Cliff's trailer. I told you.
L630528 +++$+++ u3378 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ Thank you, Carl.
L630527 +++$+++ u3375 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer  ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer...  After that I never saw him again.
L630477 +++$+++ u3375 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ That's alright. I was having a bad dream. I was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline.
L630476 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Thanks for your help, Carl. Sorry we woke you up.
L630475 +++$+++ u3375 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
L630474 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Is there a golf course around here?
L630460 +++$+++ u3375 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
L630459 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
L630447 +++$+++ u3375 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ No, hey, I already told this whole damn thing to Sheriff "Not-Quite- Able"... Here's the trailer now.
L630446 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
L630445 +++$+++ u3375 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
L630444 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Was there an argument?
L630443 +++$+++ u3375 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
L630442 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Did she have someone with her?
L630441 +++$+++ u3375 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. Teresa rented it about a month ago.
L630440 +++$+++ u3375 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ More popular than Uncle's Day at a whorehouse.  GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS BRIGHT! BLUE BRIGHT.
L630439 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please.
L630493 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ I think I'll take off my badge as well.
L630492 +++$+++ u3376 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ You try that you little monkey.
L630473 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ No you couldn't.
L630472 +++$+++ u3376 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
L630471 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Did you know Teresa Banks?
L630468 +++$+++ u3376 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
L630467 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
L630466 +++$+++ u3376 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
L630465 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
L630339 +++$+++ u3376 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ Oh.
L630338 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.
L630303 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Right, Gordon. We'll be in touch.
L630302 +++$+++ u3377 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ GOOD LUCK, CHET.  SAM, YOU STICK WITH CHET, HE'S GOT HIS OWN M.O. MODUS OPERANDI.  YOU CAN REACH ME AT THE PHILADELPHIA OFFICES. I AM FLYING OUT TODAY.
L630299 +++$+++ u3377 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
L630298 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Congratulations. I heard about that.
L630294 +++$+++ u3377 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU, CHET. SOMETHING INTERESTING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU. ARRANGEMENTS ARE BEING MADE AND I WILL MEET YOU AT THE PORTLAND, AIRPORT.
L630293 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Smell something fishy, huh?
L630292 +++$+++ u3377 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ GOT A MAP OF THE ENVIRONS OF THE YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. BETTER BRING A POLE.
L630291 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ Okay, Gordon!!!
L630290 +++$+++ u3377 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
L630289 +++$+++ u3379 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ DESMOND +++$+++ OK, Gordon.
