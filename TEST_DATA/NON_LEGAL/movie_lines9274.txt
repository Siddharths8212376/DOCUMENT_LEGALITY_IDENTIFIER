L395894 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
L395893 +++$+++ u2176 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ You're crazy! You can't do that!
L395892 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
L395891 +++$+++ u2176 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
L395890 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ I'm going to tell him the truth.
L395889 +++$+++ u2176 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ What're you going to do?
L395886 +++$+++ u2176 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Say, you haven't gone and fallen for that mug, have you?
L395885 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
L395884 +++$+++ u2176 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?  What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he—
L395883 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
L395882 +++$+++ u2176 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Why, Babe - that's terrific!  "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That—"
L395881 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Yes.
L395880 +++$+++ u2176 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
L395879 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Last night he proposed to me.
L395878 +++$+++ u2176 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ What's bothering you, huh?
L395540 +++$+++ u2176 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ You'll get it, Babe. You'll get it.
L395539 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ With pay!  She is out the door.
L395538 +++$+++ u2176 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Sure.
L395537 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
L395536 +++$+++ u2176 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you!
L395535 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
L395534 +++$+++ u2176 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ You're a genius, Babe - a genius!
L395533 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Tonight, maybe.  I'll phone him at noon.  Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson.
L395532 +++$+++ u2176 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ When're you going to see him again?
L395531 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me.
L395530 +++$+++ u2176 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Marvelous!  "At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. When asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'I just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'"  Beautiful! What happened after that?
L395529 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Had the boys follow us.
L395528 +++$+++ u2176 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ How'd you get the picture?
L395527 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ If we could sell tickets, we'd make a fortune.
L395526 +++$+++ u2176 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
L395525 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one.
L395524 +++$+++ u2176 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Is he really that big a sap?
L395523 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
L395522 +++$+++ u2176 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Did it?
L395521 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
L395520 +++$+++ u2176 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!
L395206 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Have lunch.
L395205 +++$+++ u2176 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?
L395204 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Leave four columns open on the front page tomorrow.
L395203 +++$+++ u2176 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L395202 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ With pay!
L395201 +++$+++ u2176 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ With pay!
L395200 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Can I have a month's vacation?
L395199 +++$+++ u2176 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have—
L395198 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
L395197 +++$+++ u2176 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this.
L395196 +++$+++ u2157 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BABE +++$+++ Look, I can do it!
L395847 +++$+++ u2158 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Come on - let's go!
L395846 +++$+++ u2168 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Ow! My foot's asleep!
L395808 +++$+++ u2168 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Just one little drink - and then we're ready to shoot.
L395807 +++$+++ u2158 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Boy, was he burning.
L395806 +++$+++ u2168 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yeah. Mac threw Cobb out again.
L395723 +++$+++ u2168 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Shhh!
L395722 +++$+++ u2158 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
L395610 +++$+++ u2168 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Babe ought to get him drunk again.
L395609 +++$+++ u2158 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
L395424 +++$+++ u2158 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Hurry up!
L395423 +++$+++ u2168 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Come on, come on!
L395411 +++$+++ u2158 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Right.
L395410 +++$+++ u2168 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I tell you that dame's nuts.
L395409 +++$+++ u2158 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I suppose it's going to be the same old thing.
L395656 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ I don't care what I said. I can't strangle him, can I!
L395655 +++$+++ u2159 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BUDINGTON +++$+++ Yes, but you said—
L395654 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
L395653 +++$+++ u2159 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BUDINGTON +++$+++ don't want to be critical, John, but here it is—
L395179 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Will you stop worrying! It was I who got old man Semple to turn everything over to us, wasn't it? And who got the Power of Attorney from him ! All right, and I'll get it again!  I'll take it easy. Those books'll never leave this office.
L395178 +++$+++ u2159 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BUDINGTON +++$+++ But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get—
L395177 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
L395176 +++$+++ u2159 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BUDINGTON +++$+++ But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh—
L395175 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.
L395165 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Close that door.  Will you get Mrs. Cedar on the phone, please?
L395164 +++$+++ u2159 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BUDINGTON +++$+++ John—
L395163 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
L395926 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
L395925 +++$+++ u2160 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BUTLER +++$+++ I wish you luck, sir.
L395924 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Perfect! Perfect!
L395923 +++$+++ u2160 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BUTLER +++$+++ How is this, sir?
L395920 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Yes.
L395919 +++$+++ u2160 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BUTLER +++$+++ Me sir?
L395918 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Sit over there, will you?
L395916 +++$+++ u2160 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BUTLER +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L395915 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
L395914 +++$+++ u2160 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BUTLER +++$+++ Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
L395913 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
L395912 +++$+++ u2160 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BUTLER +++$+++ Stuff, sir?
L395909 +++$+++ u2160 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BUTLER +++$+++ A smaller bowl of flowers.
L395908 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
L395907 +++$+++ u2160 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BUTLER +++$+++ Oh, yes sir.
L395906 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Is that the best you've got?
L395905 +++$+++ u2160 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BUTLER +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L395904 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Fourteen carat?
L395903 +++$+++ u2160 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BUTLER +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L395902 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Gold, eh?
L395901 +++$+++ u2160 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BUTLER +++$+++ Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
L395900 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ How's it going? Okay?
L395779 +++$+++ u2160 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BUTLER +++$+++ Me, sir?
L395778 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ You try it.
L395602 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Fine. I'll talk to her. Give me the phone, quick. She's the only one I'm going to talk to from now on.
L395601 +++$+++ u2160 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BUTLER +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L395600 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Who? Miss Dawson?
L395599 +++$+++ u2160 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BUTLER +++$+++ Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
L395598 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
L395360 +++$+++ u2160 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BUTLER +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L395359 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
L395219 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ They are? I forgot all about them.  What do you think they want?
L395218 +++$+++ u2160 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BUTLER +++$+++ The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir.
L395965 +++$+++ u2166 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ FARMER +++$+++ Let me go!
L395964 +++$+++ u2161 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BUTLERS +++$+++ We'll send for the police!
L395963 +++$+++ u2166 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ FARMER +++$+++ I wanna see that guy!
L395962 +++$+++ u2161 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BUTLERS +++$+++ He's not home, I tell you!
L395961 +++$+++ u2166 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ FARMER +++$+++ Let me go! I wanna see him!
L395960 +++$+++ u2161 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ BUTLERS +++$+++ You can't come up here!
L395669 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Nuisance value.  Maybe they have! Maybe they have! Maybe they have!  Mr. and Mrs. Semple, please. How do you do?
L395668 +++$+++ u2167 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ FIRST BROTHER +++$+++ They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
L395667 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Nuisance value?
L395666 +++$+++ u2167 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ FIRST BROTHER +++$+++ They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
L395665 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Relatives of old man Semple.
L395167 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.
L395166 +++$+++ u2167 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ FIRST BROTHER +++$+++ Come on, John. What happened?
L395016 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ I'll do no such thing. I'm going there myself. You're going with me too, Anderson - and you too, Cobb.
L395015 +++$+++ u2167 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ FIRST BROTHER +++$+++ Better wire him right away, John.
L395014 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Thank heaven.
L396343 +++$+++ u2172 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Mr. Cedar!
L396342 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ But your honor—
L396341 +++$+++ u2172 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ You will please permit Mr. Deeds to finish.
L396338 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Mr. Deeds is drawing on his warped imagination!
L396337 +++$+++ u2172 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Mr. Cedar!
L396336 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ It's a lie!
L396301 +++$+++ u2172 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Proceed.
L396300 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Your Honor, I object.
L396181 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ What was that you said he was?
L396180 +++$+++ u2172 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ He's what?
L396177 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
L396176 +++$+++ u2172 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Must we have the echo?
L396163 +++$+++ u2172 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it.
L396162 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have one of them testify.
L396123 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ This is outrageous!
L396122 +++$+++ u2172 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Miss Bennett please!
L395221 +++$+++ u2163 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ COBB +++$+++ I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
L395220 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.
L395144 +++$+++ u2163 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ COBB +++$+++ That tuba player!
L395143 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ What?
L395142 +++$+++ u2163 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ COBB +++$+++ Look!
L395138 +++$+++ u2163 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ COBB +++$+++ I looked everywhere. I even went to his house. It's locked up.
L395137 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ You can't?
L395136 +++$+++ u2163 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ COBB +++$+++ I can't find him.
L395132 +++$+++ u2163 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ COBB +++$+++ See you later, kid.
L395131 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ I can understand that.  We'll take a walk around town, meet you at the train at four o'clock.  Congratulations, Mr. Deeds. You're one of the richest men in the country. We'll see you later.  Goodbye and thank you.
L395105 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Yes. You see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. The world's full of pests. Then there's the newspapers to handle. One must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it.
L395104 +++$+++ u2163 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ COBB +++$+++ Yeah. A glorified doormat.
L395042 +++$+++ u2163 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ COBB +++$+++ No, we won't! The next time that jumping jack comes out, I'll straddle him while you ask him your questions.
L395041 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ I guess we'd better try somebody else.
L395023 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Are you sure this is the town he lives in?
L395022 +++$+++ u2163 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ COBB +++$+++ That's pretty.
L395009 +++$+++ u2163 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ COBB +++$+++ It's okay with me as long as my weekly stipend keeps coming in.
L395008 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
L395007 +++$+++ u2163 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ COBB +++$+++ But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
L395006 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ I'm not interested in the newspapers.
L395005 +++$+++ u2163 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ COBB +++$+++ Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days.  Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers.
L395004 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Hang up.
L395003 +++$+++ u2163 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ COBB +++$+++ Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney—
L395002 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Hang up.
L395001 +++$+++ u2163 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ COBB +++$+++ Wants to know who the heir is.
L395000 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Newspaperman?
L396026 +++$+++ u2180 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Okay.
L396025 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
L396024 +++$+++ u2180 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Yeah?
L396023 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Okay, then. Go to it.  And, Charlie—
L396022 +++$+++ u2180 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ All set.
L396021 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
L395020 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Mandrake Falls.  M-A-N—
L395019 +++$+++ u2180 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Where?
L395018 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
L395017 +++$+++ u2180 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Yes?
L395366 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Yes, of course, if you wish. But you must be prepared. This sort of thing will be daily routine.  If it becomes annoying, you let me know. Goodbye, Mr. Deeds. Goodbye, sir.
L395365 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
L395364 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds.  Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
L395243 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
L395242 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
L395241 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Well, if he has a claim, we'd better see him.  Send him in.
L395240 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  Tell him to see me at my office.
L395239 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Why not? Who is he?
L395230 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
L395229 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
L395228 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Huh?
L395227 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.
L395217 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington yet.
L395216 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
L395215 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
L395214 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
L395213 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
L395212 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Yes. That is to say—
L395211 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
L395210 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
L395209 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
L395208 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
L395154 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
L395153 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ No?
L395152 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
L395151 +++$+++ u2162 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ CEDAR +++$+++ I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me.
