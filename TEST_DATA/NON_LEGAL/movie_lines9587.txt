L73860 +++$+++ u3936 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
L73859 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
L73858 +++$+++ u3936 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ You can't-.
L73825 +++$+++ u3936 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own.
L73824 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
L73823 +++$+++ u3936 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ ...I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat. When we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
L73822 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ How about Richard Grayson, college student?
L73821 +++$+++ u3936 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ You have a real gratitude problem. You know that, Bruce? I need a name. Batboy? The Dark Earl? What's a good side kick name?
L73820 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ What the hell did you think you were doing?
L73766 +++$+++ u3936 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Save the sermons about how great you want my life to be, okay, Bruce? If it weren't for Batman my parents wouldn't be dead. You don't get it, do you? This is all your fault.
L73765 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.
L73764 +++$+++ u3936 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Back off, man.
L73761 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ What I do isn't about revenge.
L73760 +++$+++ u3936 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back.
L73759 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Absolutely not.
L73758 +++$+++ u3936 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ I need to be part of this.
L73611 +++$+++ u3936 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Look, spare me the sermons, okay. You're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed. You don't even know me.
L73610 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse.
L73609 +++$+++ u3936 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him.
L73608 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Where will you go? The circus is halfway to Metropolis by now.
L73607 +++$+++ u3936 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ I figure telling that cop I'd stay here saved me a truckload of social service interviews and good will. So no offense but thanks. See ya.
L73606 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Excuse me.
L73605 +++$+++ u3936 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Okay. I'm outta here.
L74023 +++$+++ u3935 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ CHASE +++$+++ You're right, Edward. I didn't mean to be impolite. Please.
L74022 +++$+++ u3937 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Can't tell if you don't say please.
L74021 +++$+++ u3935 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ CHASE +++$+++ Who is The Batman, Edward?
L74020 +++$+++ u3937 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Yesssssss. I know!
L74019 +++$+++ u3935 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ CHASE +++$+++ Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
L74018 +++$+++ u3937 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ How could I forget?
L74017 +++$+++ u3935 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ CHASE +++$+++ It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
L74016 +++$+++ u3937 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Who is it?
L74015 +++$+++ u3935 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ CHASE +++$+++ Edward...
L73783 +++$+++ u3937 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be.  What do you think of my new invention?
L73782 +++$+++ u3935 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ CHASE +++$+++ Chase?
L73442 +++$+++ u3937 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I don't think so.
L73441 +++$+++ u3940 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ STICKLEY +++$+++ ...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand?! Fired!!
L73440 +++$+++ u3937 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Yo. Charlie. Gimmie an order of brain deep-fry. Extra well done. Hold the neurons.  Patient exhibits symptoms of psycho neural overload. Notation: obviously higher settings can be dangerous to the subject.  Riddle me this, Fred. What is everything to someone and nothing to everyone else? Your mind of course. And now mine pumps with the power of yours.  New from Brain-bok. Da pump. Think faster. Reason higher. Out-cog-nate every homey on the court of life. Da pump. Yeah.  Ho! Mark. I sense an odd penchant for the anagramatic. The acrostic. The crypto-graphic. What doth this bode? Answer me Marcutio, you little runt.  Fred, I must confess you were a wonderful appetizer. Simply divine. But now I yearn for a meal of substance. The main course. A wide and varied palette. Ah, to taste the mind of a hero. A nobleman. A poet.  A chick in a short skirt wouldn't be so bad either.
L73433 +++$+++ u3940 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ STICKLEY +++$+++ What the hell is going on here?
L73432 +++$+++ u3937 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I'll show you it works.
L73350 +++$+++ u3940 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ STICKLEY +++$+++ Fred?
L73349 +++$+++ u3937 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Hell. Might even bring old Stickley here a few extra bucks. Huh, Fred?
L73348 +++$+++ u3937 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ ...The Box can change their lives.  Our stock coupons will spike.
L73347 +++$+++ u3940 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ STICKLEY +++$+++ Paranoid? The psychotic?
L73346 +++$+++ u3937 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Why be brutalized by an uncaring world? My RES Box will give Joe Q Public a realm where he is king.  Not that someone like you would need it. Someone so intelligent. Witty. Charming. But for the lonely, the...
L73342 +++$+++ u3937 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is man's greatest tool?
L73341 +++$+++ u3940 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ STICKLEY +++$+++ I really do apologize, Mr. Wayne. His project was terminated this morning...
L73411 +++$+++ u3941 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ TWO-FACE +++$+++ Never heard of a double-cross?
L73410 +++$+++ u3938 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ Wait! You said you'd let me go!
L73385 +++$+++ u3941 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ TWO-FACE +++$+++ Just call us Harvey. Can we get you a sandwich? A soft drink? Given all the trouble we caused you, how about we cut you in for a share of tonight's haul?
L73384 +++$+++ u3938 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
L73383 +++$+++ u3941 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ TWO-FACE +++$+++ That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better?
L73380 +++$+++ u3941 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ TWO-FACE +++$+++ The coin _wants_ to decide.
L73379 +++$+++ u3938 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ Please. I swear I won't say noth-
L73378 +++$+++ u3941 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ TWO-FACE +++$+++ ...or death.
L73376 +++$+++ u3941 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ TWO-FACE +++$+++ What say we flip for it?
L73375 +++$+++ u3938 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ I got family. ...Please.
L73374 +++$+++ u3941 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ TWO-FACE +++$+++ Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
L73373 +++$+++ u3938 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ ...You gonna kill me?
L73372 +++$+++ u3941 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ TWO-FACE +++$+++ _We_ sure are.
L73963 +++$+++ u3939 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ RIDDLER +++$+++ You sunk my battleship.
L73962 +++$+++ u3941 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ TWO-FACE +++$+++ A hit.
L73961 +++$+++ u3939 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ RIDDLER +++$+++ A miss. And my favorite vitamin, I might add.
L73960 +++$+++ u3941 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ TWO-FACE +++$+++ B-12.
L73959 +++$+++ u3941 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ TWO-FACE +++$+++ Miss.
L73958 +++$+++ u3939 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ RIDDLER +++$+++ A-14.
L73898 +++$+++ u3939 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ RIDDLER +++$+++ Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will!
L73897 +++$+++ u3941 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ TWO-FACE +++$+++ We want to dust him. We truly want to dust him bad.
L73852 +++$+++ u3941 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ TWO-FACE +++$+++ You're a genius.
L73851 +++$+++ u3939 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ RIDDLER +++$+++ Go ahead. You can say it.
L73844 +++$+++ u3939 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ RIDDLER +++$+++ Kill me? Well, alright. Go ahead. Take the empire. All yours.  Hell, Harv, old pals. I'll kill me for you.
L73843 +++$+++ u3941 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ TWO-FACE +++$+++ Why do we need you? You only come between us. We can be the smartest person in Gotham City. We want the empire for ourselves. Time's up, laughing boy.
L73700 +++$+++ u3941 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ TWO-FACE +++$+++ Everything.
L73699 +++$+++ u3939 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ RIDDLER +++$+++ About what?
L73698 +++$+++ u3941 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ TWO-FACE +++$+++ Oh my God. Jim Morrison was right.
L73697 +++$+++ u3941 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ TWO-FACE +++$+++ Don't bogart that 'trode.
L73696 +++$+++ u3939 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ RIDDLER +++$+++ Not until you do that thing I like.  On se tue pour des mesnonges. J'ai gache ma vie...  Woah. Harsh toke.
L73693 +++$+++ u3939 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ RIDDLER +++$+++ Haven't you had enough? Don't Think And Drive.
L73692 +++$+++ u3941 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ TWO-FACE +++$+++ Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again.
L73687 +++$+++ u3939 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ RIDDLER +++$+++ Here. Get a good seat.
L73686 +++$+++ u3941 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ TWO-FACE +++$+++ Where are you sending Batboy this time?
L73670 +++$+++ u3939 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ RIDDLER +++$+++ Addictive isn't it? Just Say No. Until I say yes. A little fringe benefit of working with me. Now here's the concept, counselor. Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help me gather production capital so I can produce enough of these  to create an empire that will eclipse Bruce Wayne's forever. And, in return I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all. Who is Batman?
L73669 +++$+++ u3941 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ TWO-FACE +++$+++ No.  Wait...
L73666 +++$+++ u3939 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ RIDDLER +++$+++ So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I respect the sentiment.
L73665 +++$+++ u3941 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ TWO-FACE +++$+++ Holy shit.
L73660 +++$+++ u3941 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ TWO-FACE +++$+++ Let's see if you bleed green.
L73659 +++$+++ u3939 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ RIDDLER +++$+++ Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
L73658 +++$+++ u3941 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ TWO-FACE +++$+++ A man with a death wish.
L73657 +++$+++ u3939 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ RIDDLER +++$+++ Yet so bright and chipper and conservative!  It's so you.  And yet so _you_!  Very few people are both a summer _and_ a winter. But you pull it off nicely.
L73654 +++$+++ u3941 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ TWO-FACE +++$+++ Congratulations. You get to die on the dean's list.
L73653 +++$+++ u3939 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ RIDDLER +++$+++ You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
L73652 +++$+++ u3941 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ TWO-FACE +++$+++ How'd you find us?
L74500 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you?
L74499 +++$+++ u3942 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
L74498 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
L74497 +++$+++ u3942 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Yes?
L74133 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ The small one.
L74132 +++$+++ u3942 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Which bathroom is that, sir?
L74131 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
L74130 +++$+++ u3942 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
L74129 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ How high up would you say that is?
L74611 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ If not for you I never would've made it. You know that. My own parents couldn't have...  ... The boy, Alfred. You'll both be provided for. Don't let all this got to waste.
L74610 +++$+++ u3942 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
L74609 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ How long's it been, Alfred? A quarter of a century?  It seems like yesterday. I guess we ended up doing more harm than good.
L74608 +++$+++ u3942 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you.
L74607 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
L74606 +++$+++ u3942 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Upstairs. He's quite docile.
L74605 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Where's the boy?
L74595 +++$+++ u3942 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ ... Very good, sir.
L74594 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.
L74167 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Thank you, Alfred.  I hope you'll excuse me.  It was a great pleasure meeting you.  And you.
L74166 +++$+++ u3942 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Excuse me, sir.  Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave - -very unexpectedly.  He asked me to convey his regrets.
L74654 +++$+++ u3951 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JOKER +++$+++ Bruce, we're both murderers. Think how many people you've killed by letting me live.
L74653 +++$+++ u3943 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ ... Murderer...
L74652 +++$+++ u3951 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JOKER +++$+++ You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously.
L74572 +++$+++ u3951 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JOKER +++$+++ Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all...  ... You made me what I am today.
L74571 +++$+++ u3943 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L74570 +++$+++ u3951 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JOKER +++$+++ Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
L74569 +++$+++ u3943 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ Take me. Let the boy go.
L74568 +++$+++ u3951 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ JOKER +++$+++ Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
L74448 +++$+++ u3943 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ I had to save you, Vicki. I --  -- Please trust me.
L74447 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
L74446 +++$+++ u3943 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ Is this what you wanted?
L74444 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ If you don't mind my asking... Who's close to you?
L74443 +++$+++ u3943 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
L74442 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
L74441 +++$+++ u3943 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ No. Every product contains one component. The elements react in combination. Hair spray won't do it. But hair spray and perfume and lipstick will.  Untraceable. It's very elegant.
L74440 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
L74439 +++$+++ u3943 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.
L74438 +++$+++ u3943 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ Photo database. I'll do your photos now.
L74437 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ What is that?
L74436 +++$+++ u3943 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ So did I, once. But I kept coming back, and... I guess I became the thing I feared most.
L74435 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ I loathe bats.
L74434 +++$+++ u3943 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights.
L74433 +++$+++ u3943 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.
L74432 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ How'd you find this place?
L74431 +++$+++ u3943 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ That's why I wear a target on my chest.
L74430 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ It doesn't protect your head, though.
L74429 +++$+++ u3943 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ Better. It's not on the market yet.
L74428 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ What is this stuff? Kevlar?
L74424 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ Well, I've certainly enjoyed it. -- What's that?
L74423 +++$+++ u3943 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
L74422 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ ... How long have I been out?
L74415 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ ... Where are you taking me?
L74414 +++$+++ u3943 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ Thank you, Vicki.
L74413 +++$+++ u3943 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ I'll take you with me.
L74412 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ How do I know you won't keep them all?
L74411 +++$+++ u3943 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
L74410 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
L74409 +++$+++ u3943 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So --
L74407 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ I won't let you have it.
L74406 +++$+++ u3943 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ Please.
L74405 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you.
L74404 +++$+++ u3943 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ I'll have to ask you for that film.
L74402 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ Well -- I think you might consider
L74401 +++$+++ u3943 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ ...Not even a 'thank you'?
L74384 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ ... A hundred and eight?
L74383 +++$+++ u3943 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ How much do you weigh?
L74377 +++$+++ u3943 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ Too many people. Come on!  SHIELDS!!
L74376 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ Can't we --
L74375 +++$+++ u3943 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT!
L74374 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ What about the girl?
L74372 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ Shouldn't we --
L74371 +++$+++ u3943 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ I know. I called them.
L74370 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ Look! Police!
L74365 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ WHICH CAR?
L74364 +++$+++ u3943 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ GET IN THE CAR!!
L74512 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Alfred, bring something for Mr. Knox -- I'll have one, too.
L74511 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
L74510 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Do you want a drink?
L74508 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Because I...  ... Because she'd never speak to me again.
L74507 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
L74506 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.
L74505 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want, man. I just want your word.
L74504 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
L74503 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
L74502 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ What is it you want?
L74501 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ That's how it is, chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good.
L74158 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ You're just back from Corto Maltese.  I saw your combat photos.  Quite a departure for you.
L74157 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ "This is Miss Vale." -- That felt redundant.
L74156 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
L74155 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Great.  Give me a grant.
L74154 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
L74153 +++$+++ u3952 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host.  Alexander Knox.
L74667 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me?
L74666 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
L74665 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Ohhhh... You don't mean that.
L74664 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple.
L74603 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ In all these years... Why couldn't I see how it wold turn out?
L74602 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
L74601 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ All this apparatus, Vicki... This house, and the money, and the power ... It was never mine. It was something I inherited. Bruce Wayne was something I inherited.  All I ever hoped for was someone who could see through Bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened.
L74544 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Hang on. I have to leave a message.
L74543 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ What now?
L74542 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Got it!
L74541 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.
L74540 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ How can you do that if she's already off the line?
L74539 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Finding out where she is.
L74538 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
L74537 +++$+++ u3956 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ VICKI +++$+++ ... Where are you calling from?
L74536 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Keep her on the line!
L74534 +++$+++ u3944 +++$+++ m262 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ The does it. It's going to be this weekend.
