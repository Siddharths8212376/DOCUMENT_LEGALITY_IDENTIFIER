L582205 +++$+++ u8203 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
L582204 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.
L582203 +++$+++ u8203 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?
L582202 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ Peter, okay?
L582201 +++$+++ u8203 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Agent Novak?
L582200 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ Ah, the part of us that can't be explained.
L582199 +++$+++ u8203 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it.
L582198 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ What then?
L582197 +++$+++ u8203 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ It doesn't have much to do with science.
L582196 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ I read about a woman in TExas who was in a coma for seven years.  Every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster.  Isn't that something?  I don't know what name scientists have for something like that...
L582195 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ No.  Not at all.  From what I understand, he knows I"m here, isn't that right?
L582194 +++$+++ u8203 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Do you think that's funny?
L582193 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ Edward Baines, I presume.  Hi, Ed.  I'm Pete.
L582140 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ I know him.
L582139 +++$+++ u8203 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ You don't know the procedure.
L582138 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ This man is deeply disturbed, he...
L582133 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ How hard could it be...?
L582132 +++$+++ u8203 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I realize that...
L582131 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some "troubled kid" you're dealing with.
L582107 +++$+++ u8203 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.
L582106 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
L582105 +++$+++ u8203 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
L582104 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ There's always a chance they'll confess.
L582102 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ As far as I needed.
L582101 +++$+++ u8203 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ What if he wasn't like this?  What if he was "normal?"  Conscious.  How far would you go?
L581896 +++$+++ u8203 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I bet we can fix it.
L581895 +++$+++ u8205 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ "Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
L581894 +++$+++ u8203 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Oh no... No you don't.
L581893 +++$+++ u8205 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Mocky-Lock.
L581892 +++$+++ u8203 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Who says?
L581891 +++$+++ u8205 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ 's broken.
L581890 +++$+++ u8203 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ What now?
L581884 +++$+++ u8203 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ He's beautiful...
L581883 +++$+++ u8205 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ You liked him?
L582470 +++$+++ u8204 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I never kid.  My wife hates it.  Says I'm too serious.
L582469 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ You're kidding me.
L582468 +++$+++ u8204 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
L582467 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ Delano?
L582466 +++$+++ u8204 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
L582385 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ That hoist, with the winch...
L582384 +++$+++ u8204 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Already there.
L582383 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ I need you to find something in the basement...
L582382 +++$+++ u8204 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Agent Cole.
L581973 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ Just graduated law school.  Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter.
L581972 +++$+++ u8204 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ She the one from Santa Cruz?
L582417 +++$+++ u8207 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ She's bringing Stargher into hers.
L582416 +++$+++ u8206 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Instead of going into his mind...
L582412 +++$+++ u8206 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ It would take hours to re-route the system, and even if I did, I shouldn't.
L582411 +++$+++ u8207 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ What's wrong?
L582410 +++$+++ u8206 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ She changed the codes.
L582252 +++$+++ u8206 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I think that's the whole point.
L582251 +++$+++ u8207 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
L582185 +++$+++ u8207 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
L582184 +++$+++ u8206 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.
L582163 +++$+++ u8206 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Initiating connection.
L582162 +++$+++ u8207 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ Intravenous administration complete.
L582161 +++$+++ u8207 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers."  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared.
L582160 +++$+++ u8206 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke.
L582124 +++$+++ u8207 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ They took care of that, thank you, Henry. 
L582123 +++$+++ u8206 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
L582493 +++$+++ u8207 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ Completely unaware.
L582492 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ What about the cat?
L582491 +++$+++ u8207 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ Awaiting his arrival.
L582490 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ How's the patient.
L582489 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
L582488 +++$+++ u8207 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ That's a secret.
L582487 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.
L582486 +++$+++ u8207 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ You're looking well.
L582485 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ Dr. Kent.
L582484 +++$+++ u8207 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ Agent Novak.
L582380 +++$+++ u8207 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...
L582379 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ Is she alright?
L582330 +++$+++ u8207 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ I doubt that.
L582329 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
L582328 +++$+++ u8207 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
L582327 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ No.
L582326 +++$+++ u8207 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ What about narcotics?
L582325 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ No.
L582324 +++$+++ u8207 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ Any psychiatric medication?
L582323 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ Prevacid.  For my stomach.
L582322 +++$+++ u8207 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
L582321 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ Absolutely.
L582320 +++$+++ u8207 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ Nervous?
L582317 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ No.
L582316 +++$+++ u8207 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ I have done this, you know.  Been inside.
L582313 +++$+++ u8207 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ Yes.
L582312 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ Into Stargher.  Inside...
L582311 +++$+++ u8207 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.
L582310 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
L582192 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ I'll get her...
L582191 +++$+++ u8207 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ Catherine!
L582095 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights.
L582094 +++$+++ u8207 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ What about the legalities of this...?
L582091 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ Sometime yesterday morning.
L582090 +++$+++ u8207 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ When did he lapse into the coma?
L582014 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ It's his dog.
L582013 +++$+++ u8210 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ TEDDY LEE +++$+++ The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.
L582002 +++$+++ u8210 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ TEDDY LEE +++$+++ Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed.
L582001 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ The dog's an albino.  He'd love an animal like that.
L581998 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ Now.
L581997 +++$+++ u8210 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ TEDDY LEE +++$+++ Now?
L581996 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ I need it.
L581995 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
L581994 +++$+++ u8210 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ TEDDY LEE +++$+++ So?
L581976 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ Grandparents.  Live over in Davis.
L581975 +++$+++ u8210 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ TEDDY LEE +++$+++ Someone looking after her little girl?
L582394 +++$+++ u8209 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ RAMSEY +++$+++ You might've seen Jimmy Hoffa dancing with Timothy Leary.  I don't care.
L582393 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
L582392 +++$+++ u8209 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ RAMSEY +++$+++ You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?
L582390 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ Considering where I've been...
L582389 +++$+++ u8209 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ RAMSEY +++$+++ Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.
L582244 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ But you looked so cute.  All sleepy...
L582243 +++$+++ u8209 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ RAMSEY +++$+++ Next time, tell me, okay?
L582242 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ Right here.
L582120 +++$+++ u8209 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ RAMSEY +++$+++ That's not what I'm talking about, Pete. I'm talking about waking up and realizing this girl's gonna die.
L582119 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea."
L582118 +++$+++ u8209 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ RAMSEY +++$+++ Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
L582117 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ I don't have to.
L582116 +++$+++ u8209 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ RAMSEY +++$+++ I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
L582115 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ What else do we do?!
L582114 +++$+++ u8209 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ RAMSEY +++$+++ You sure you want to go through with this?
L582078 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!
L582077 +++$+++ u8209 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ RAMSEY +++$+++ We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere.
L582043 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ No.  Can you get a man close?
L582042 +++$+++ u8209 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ RAMSEY +++$+++ Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.
L582041 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ We proceed assuming she is.
L582031 +++$+++ u8209 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ RAMSEY +++$+++ She remembers because it was her "dream truck."  Wanted one just like it.
L582030 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
L582012 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ Nicole Labetzki.  Victim seven. Forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a K-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked.
L582011 +++$+++ u8209 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ RAMSEY +++$+++ Breeders typically destroy albino pups, so this animal is truly unique.
L581988 +++$+++ u8209 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ RAMSEY +++$+++ Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!
L581987 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ Here he is.
L581986 +++$+++ u8209 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ RAMSEY +++$+++ Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
L581985 +++$+++ u8208 +++$+++ m557 +++$+++ NOVAK +++$+++ How is she?
L584991 +++$+++ u8211 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ They think you did it.
L584990 +++$+++ u8225 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Warscheinlich ist der murder.
L584702 +++$+++ u8225 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Das worren nooh zeiten.
L584701 +++$+++ u8211 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Give her some cigarettes.
L584700 +++$+++ u8225 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Hier sind fruher Fursten ans unt eingeganger. Hier hat sogar ein Metternich verkehrt...
L584698 +++$+++ u8225 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Sayen sie ed our den Leuten damit sie es auch wissen.
L584697 +++$+++ u8211 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Ja, ja, ja.
L584696 +++$+++ u8225 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Den leuten.
L584630 +++$+++ u8225 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Das mussen sie doch wissen. Ich meine ohne grund wird die politzei doch nicht ins Hans komme Fraulein Schmidt, ein schande...
L584629 +++$+++ u8211 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Ich weiss nicht.
L585510 +++$+++ u8211 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
L585509 +++$+++ u8218 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ MARTINS +++$+++ ...anyway?
L585467 +++$+++ u8211 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.
L585466 +++$+++ u8218 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ MARTINS +++$+++ ...quarrel?
L585454 +++$+++ u8218 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ MARTINS +++$+++ We're getting you out of here, aren't we?
L585453 +++$+++ u8211 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Why are you lying?
L585452 +++$+++ u8218 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ MARTINS +++$+++ Oh, well.
L585451 +++$+++ u8211 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ His.
L585450 +++$+++ u8218 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ MARTINS +++$+++ That's his headache.
L585449 +++$+++ u8211 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Why should he help me like that? The Russians will only make trouble for him.
L585448 +++$+++ u8218 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ MARTINS +++$+++ Of course I didn't tell Calloway.
L585447 +++$+++ u8211 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ There's something wrong. Did you tell Calloway about meeting Harry?
L585446 +++$+++ u8218 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ MARTINS +++$+++ Oh, the usual things...
L585445 +++$+++ u8211 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Did he say anything about me - tell me?
L585442 +++$+++ u8218 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ MARTINS +++$+++ I saw him today.
L585441 +++$+++ u8211 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ How do you know?
L585440 +++$+++ u8218 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ MARTINS +++$+++ He's safe in the Russian zone.
L585439 +++$+++ u8211 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
L585438 +++$+++ u8218 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ MARTINS +++$+++ You send me a wire as soon as you arrive.
L585437 +++$+++ u8211 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I shall be all right.
L585436 +++$+++ u8218 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ MARTINS +++$+++ Here, it will be cold on that train.
L585435 +++$+++ u8218 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ MARTINS +++$+++ Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
L585434 +++$+++ u8211 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ What is on your mind? Why did you hide?
L585432 +++$+++ u8211 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L585431 +++$+++ u8218 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ MARTINS +++$+++ Harry.
L585427 +++$+++ u8211 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Have you been seeing Major Calloway again?
L585426 +++$+++ u8218 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ MARTINS +++$+++ ...Headquarters.
L585424 +++$+++ u8211 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ How did you know I would be here?
L585423 +++$+++ u8218 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ MARTINS +++$+++ ...is there?
L585418 +++$+++ u8218 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ MARTINS +++$+++ Oh...
L585417 +++$+++ u8211 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Are you going, too?
L585198 +++$+++ u8211 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ There isn't enough for two laughs.
L585197 +++$+++ u8218 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ MARTINS +++$+++ ...again.
L585185 +++$+++ u8218 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ MARTINS +++$+++ Well, don't preach wisdom to me. You talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.
L585184 +++$+++ u8211 +++$+++ m558 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ ...and my lover. He was Harry.
