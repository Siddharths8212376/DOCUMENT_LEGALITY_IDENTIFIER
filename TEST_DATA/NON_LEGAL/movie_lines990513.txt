L652398 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment?
L652282 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you, then?
L652281 +++$+++ u8901 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL MERKIN +++$+++ What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.
L652280 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"
L652279 +++$+++ u8901 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL MERKIN +++$+++ I never figured you for a pimp.
L652278 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.
L652277 +++$+++ u8901 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL MERKIN +++$+++ That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
L652276 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
L652275 +++$+++ u8901 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL MERKIN +++$+++ Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
L652274 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
L652273 +++$+++ u8901 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL MERKIN +++$+++ I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
L652272 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Thanks, Principal Merkin.
L652271 +++$+++ u8901 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL MERKIN +++$+++ I like you, Ted. You know that. I liked you before you were filthy rich.
L652744 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ Aw, come on, kid. Throw me a bone. I'm your uncle for gosh sakes.
L652743 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.
L652742 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.
L652741 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.
L652737 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ My job. Back off, Benedict.
L652736 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ What are you doing?
L652735 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ --PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
L652734 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--
L652688 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ We've got a huge problem with the magazine, Ted-baby. Our readers hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk.
L652687 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Yes?
L652559 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ You're a great kid. Don't you forget it.
L652558 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
L652557 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.
L652556 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books.  Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking.
L652554 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Yeah, well, like my Grandpa used to say...you can't change your Christmas past, but you sure can exchange your Christmas presents.
L652553 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
L652552 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.
L652551 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ You're taking this bull of an empire by the horns, but you're still keeping your small town values. You're not letting all this "stuff" spoil you.
L652550 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Seriously? I'm doing all right?
L652549 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?
L652548 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything.
L652547 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ I can't wait to see the pictures.
L652546 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
L652428 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ He was in a league of his own.
L652427 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ My father must've been amazing.
L652425 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Really? So I'm doing OK?
L652424 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
L652226 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part.  For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why.
L652225 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications.
L652221 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That's perfect.
L652220 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
L652219 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ In other words, our scope is too narrow.
L652218 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
L652217 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You think we should be more open minded?
L652216 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
L652215 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What kind of ideas?
L652214 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ It's not like I didn't have ideas, I had plenty of ideas. But I never even shared them with your father. Never had the guts.
L652213 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ My parents always say hard work builds character.
L652212 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.
L652211 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
L652210 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
L652209 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Really? You'd do that for me?
L652208 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine.
L652207 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
L652206 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
L652205 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
L652204 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ You were the new and improved you.
L652203 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I was like a different person tonight.
L652202 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ I told you you could do it.
L652199 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ Why, look who's here.
L652198 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
L652197 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
L652196 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Me? The King of Coitus?
L652195 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.
L652193 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
L652192 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I do?
L652191 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
L652190 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
L652189 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
L652188 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
L652187 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ They said that? Really?  Oh, your parents. The Nelson's. Right, right. How midwest. I like that.
L652186 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.
L652185 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ You ready for your big coming out party? Everybody's dying to meet you.
L652184 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Yeah.  Everything's cool.
L652183 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right?
L652180 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Tipping?
L652179 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
L652087 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.
L652086 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman.
L652073 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.
L652072 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
L652067 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Seldom? No kidding?
L652066 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ The parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy. Which is seldom.
L652063 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ You're sure?
L652062 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ As much as possible.
L652061 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
L652060 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Of course I like girls.
L652059 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ You do like girls, don't you?
L652058 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ I have only one concern...
L652057 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
L652056 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ Smashing!  Welcome to the family, Ted. You are going to breathe some new life into this place. You are going to set the world on fire! You are going to...call me Uncle Billy? Please?
L652036 +++$+++ u8905 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ ZUKERMAN +++$+++ Your fathered owned the entire "Heaven" empire.  You own it now. Any questions?
L652035 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
L652034 +++$+++ u8905 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ ZUKERMAN +++$+++ Are you familiar with "Heaven?"
L651958 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It's spring break. I don't want to go to a will reading.
L651957 +++$+++ u8905 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ ZUKERMAN +++$+++ How quaint.
L651953 +++$+++ u8905 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ ZUKERMAN +++$+++ Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
L651952 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
L651951 +++$+++ u8905 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ ZUKERMAN +++$+++ I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
L651950 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ My parents? What do you mean?
L651949 +++$+++ u8905 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ ZUKERMAN +++$+++ It's about your parents.
L651948 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day.
L651947 +++$+++ u8905 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ ZUKERMAN +++$+++ I'm just a messenger.
L651946 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ People pay good money for that?
L651945 +++$+++ u8905 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ ZUKERMAN +++$+++ Bad news.
L651944 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
L651943 +++$+++ u8905 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ ZUKERMAN +++$+++ In a hurry, are we?
L655070 +++$+++ u8906 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ ART +++$+++ I... You know... I...
L655069 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ How you doing, Artie?
L654862 +++$+++ u8906 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ ART +++$+++ The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay. They built the school... Sandra Van Ryan calls up the board and says kiss my ass, they say, left, right, or in the middle.  You're gonna need some help on this one, Sam.  You're gonna need a lawyer, and he'd better be a good one.
L654861 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
L654860 +++$+++ u8906 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ ART +++$+++ All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay...
L654859 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ This is insane.
L654858 +++$+++ u8906 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ ART +++$+++ Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...
L654857 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ ... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
L654856 +++$+++ u8906 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ ART +++$+++ Kelly Van Ryan...
L654855 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Talk to me Artie.
L654690 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
L654689 +++$+++ u8906 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ ART +++$+++ So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?
L655226 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'd like that.
L655225 +++$+++ u8907 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
L655224 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
L655223 +++$+++ u8907 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ And where might that be?
L655222 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right?  I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner.
L655219 +++$+++ u8907 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Thanks.
L655218 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You look pretty.
L654747 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep.  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.
L654746 +++$+++ u8907 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ She's going to wash your Jeep?
L654745 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Kelly.
L654744 +++$+++ u8907 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
L654737 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Eat a power bar.
L654736 +++$+++ u8907 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Not that I'm going to be much good after last night...
L655305 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Second you get something on those teeth, I want it
L655304 +++$+++ u8908 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a lot of other people's too...
L655303 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What about the blood?
L655302 +++$+++ u8908 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
L655301 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ The teeth doin' any talkin'?
L655300 +++$+++ u8908 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Merritt, Forensics.
L655289 +++$+++ u8908 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.
L655288 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ How soon can we get something?
L655432 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ I'm fine.  Nice TV.
L655431 +++$+++ u8915 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ You okay?
L655429 +++$+++ u8915 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece.
L655428 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.
L655427 +++$+++ u8915 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Raised her like she was, but no, Walter's my only child.  He was a good boy, till the army took him.
L655426 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
L655425 +++$+++ u8915 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
L655424 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ And the child...
L655423 +++$+++ u8915 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.
L655387 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Was there ever any kind of investigation...
L655386 +++$+++ u8915 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
L655385 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ She still work there?
L655384 +++$+++ u8915 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.
L655383 +++$+++ u8915 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ He used to come around here.  He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades.
L655382 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
L655381 +++$+++ u8915 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ About Suzie?
L655380 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
L655379 +++$+++ u8915 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
L655378 +++$+++ u8915 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye.  He don't use it for no good deeds anyway.
L655377 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
L655376 +++$+++ u8915 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
L654834 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that.  He said, "No little girl can ever make me come."
L654833 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Try, Kelly.
L654832 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
L654831 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ You mean he withdrew...
L654830 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
L654829 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Then what?
L654828 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
L654827 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Did you try to fight him?
L654826 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ He was large?
L654825 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
L654824 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you?
L654823 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...
L654822 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
L654821 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
L654820 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ I understand.
L654819 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ They were in me.  Both places... you know.
L654818 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Take your time.
L654817 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers...
L654813 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ I know you do.
L654812 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
L654811 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?
L655332 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Suzie?
L655331 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify.
L655327 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ You could tell me where you were last night.
L655326 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't know what to say...
L655325 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Ray thinks she was murdered.
L655324 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Maybe she used another name.
L655323 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
L655322 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ How long?
L655321 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Suzie Toller is missing.
L655320 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
L654920 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office.
L654919 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Weren't you a little worried about her...?
L654918 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No.
L654917 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons?
