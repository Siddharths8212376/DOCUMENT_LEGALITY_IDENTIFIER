L554039 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ That, that's Indian?
L554038 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Hey, w-why don't you see if he's hiring, you know? Get an application?
L554023 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Well, then, there now, why don't you go inside and call the cops and I'll come in there and blow your fucking brains out.
L554022 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
L554021 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Jeff, stay there.
L554019 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Just put it down.
L554018 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ No.
L554017 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Will you just put the gun down?
L554016 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
L554015 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ They're just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know?
L554014 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me.
L554013 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
L554012 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ This is my home.
L554011 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Just go home, alright?
L554010 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Well, what am I supposed to sleep off? My life? You know, I'm supposed to go home and go to sleep and when I wake up, what'll I be, Jeff? A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. Right? I don't think so, man.
L554009 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off.
L554008 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ No? Well, I disagree. I think they did. I think they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? Makes me sick.
L554007 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No.
L554006 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
L554005 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No.
L554004 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ You don't know?
L554003 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I don't know.
L554002 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
L554001 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
L554000 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Good, good. I, I hope he does.
L553999 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
L553998 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ I'm a loser. And I'm drunk. But I'm not gutless.
L553997 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.
L553996 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
L553995 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?
L553994 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Oh, shit.
L553993 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Why? Because I give a shit?
L553992 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
L553991 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Yes.
L553990 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Wow. You did that for me?
L553989 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
L553988 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
L553987 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ You lied to me.
L553986 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
L553985 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ They let you out?
L553873 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Oh fuck.
L553872 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts.
L553871 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious?
L553870 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.
L553869 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?
L553868 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ I hit her.
L553867 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ What'd you do?
L553866 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you know. It was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? And she started crying, "Tim, Tim, what's the matter? I love you. Don't go!" And I was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and I was filled with disgust, man. And I fuckin'... Oh, man, I really...
L553865 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Well, w-what happened?
L553864 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ That chick, Erica?
L553863 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ What? What'd you do?
L553862 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.
L553861 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know? I can come down and, and get you out.
L553838 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!
L553837 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
L553836 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Yeah, fuck 'em.
L553835 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
L553834 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ What?
L553833 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
L553832 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No.
L553831 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?
L553830 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Good. That's good.
L553829 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.
L553828 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ To women. They're all whores. Let us not forget what Chenowsky said. "The greatest men are the most alone." And without suffering, Jeffery, you will never gain wisdom.
L553769 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?
L553768 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ See ya later.
L553755 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Ask your girlfriend.
L553754 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Tim, what are you talking about?
L553751 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
L553750 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.
L553530 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Oh, shut up, Tim. This isn't funny, man.
L553529 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
L553528 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
L553527 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.
L553526 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a limousine to know who I am, alright?
L553523 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole?
L553522 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Wow, you're cute when you're angry.
L553426 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Wow, that must be pretty nice there.
L553425 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Yeah, yeah, I stay at the Four Seas, it's ease.
L553038 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Well, you know, I wanna fucking see him. I gotta know what it's like to be on MTV.
L553037 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Sooze wants to see him.
L553036 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.
L553031 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No. We were just gonna go someplace or something to...
L553030 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Oh, no, you wanted to get together with your close friend, Pony, the rockstar. I understand. So you, do you, want us to, leave?
L553009 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Nobody. Sooze.
L553008 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Who were you talking to?
L553007 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ You don't need to sit next to me right now.
L552988 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Because I'm alienated.
L552987 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
L552982 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.
L552981 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
L552980 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
L552979 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
L552978 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
L552977 +++$+++ u7942 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Buff, sit. You know what I mean though? Somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat.
L554076 +++$+++ u7937 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ NAZEER +++$+++ Okay. Okay, look my wife called the police. They're coming. It's not too late. They'll come, they'll take care of her. I'm going inside.
L554075 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I don't know. I think she's breathing.
L554074 +++$+++ u7937 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ NAZEER +++$+++ This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!  How is she?
L554044 +++$+++ u7937 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ NAZEER +++$+++ Look, look, just get off my property.
L554043 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Please?
L554037 +++$+++ u7937 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ NAZEER +++$+++ Nazeer Chaudry!
L554036 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Nazeer what?
L554035 +++$+++ u7937 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ NAZEER +++$+++ Okay. Nazeer, okay?
L554034 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
L554033 +++$+++ u7937 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ NAZEER +++$+++ Look, why do you care, huh?
L554032 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What is your name?
L553880 +++$+++ u7937 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ NAZEER +++$+++ Complicated or not, life moves on. Hm?
L553879 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ That's right.
L553878 +++$+++ u7937 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ NAZEER +++$+++ Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
L553877 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
L553876 +++$+++ u7937 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ NAZEER +++$+++ You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
L553875 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I don't know.
L553874 +++$+++ u7937 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ NAZEER +++$+++ You know, this, what you're doing with your life...
L553135 +++$+++ u7937 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ NAZEER +++$+++ Look, your trespassing.
