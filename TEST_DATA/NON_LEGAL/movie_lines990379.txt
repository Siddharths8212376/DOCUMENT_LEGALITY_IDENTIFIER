L567298 +++$+++ u8079 +++$+++ m547 +++$+++ VIDEO SARAH +++$+++ On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
L567297 +++$+++ u8080 +++$+++ m547 +++$+++ VIDEO SILBERMAN +++$+++ I'm sure it feels very real to you --
L567296 +++$+++ u8079 +++$+++ m547 +++$+++ VIDEO SARAH +++$+++ It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!!
L567293 +++$+++ u8080 +++$+++ m547 +++$+++ VIDEO SILBERMAN +++$+++ Please continue...
L567292 +++$+++ u8079 +++$+++ m547 +++$+++ VIDEO SARAH +++$+++ ... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow I can still see.  Look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do I have to --
L568344 +++$+++ u8085 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Our duty is to help Furtwängler with his defence,  That's why I want you to look at this...  These are part of the transcripts of the trial at Nuremberg. We can't get them translated fast enough. But I guess you understand German, right?
L568343 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.
L568342 +++$+++ u8085 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ You represent the United States now. We have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just.
L568341 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I don't know.
L568340 +++$+++ u8085 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ On Furtwängler.
L568339 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ On all what?
L568338 +++$+++ u8085 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Where do you stand on all this?
L568501 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
L568500 +++$+++ u8083 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ EMMI +++$+++ 'Please remember that Dr. Furtwängler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
L568381 +++$+++ u8083 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ EMMI +++$+++ I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
L568380 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
L568379 +++$+++ u8083 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ EMMI +++$+++ When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
L568378 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yesterday I read that Furtwängler was asked to lead the New York Philharmonic back in '36, Toscanini suggested it. Had he accepted, he would have become the most celebrated conductor in America.
L568269 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ But I promised your mother.
L568268 +++$+++ u8083 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ EMMI +++$+++ Don't see me to my door, there's no need.
L568262 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I don't know.
L568261 +++$+++ u8083 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ EMMI +++$+++ What does he mean, too correct?
L568125 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Right. So, this is going to be very formal, too, now. Lieutenant David Wills requests die pleasure of die company of Fraulein Emmi Straube at dinner any night she cares.
L568124 +++$+++ u8083 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ EMMI +++$+++ And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
L568123 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Eating is eating... and...
L568122 +++$+++ u8083 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ EMMI +++$+++ And no elbows on the table!
L568121 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Respect your elders and your betters!
L568120 +++$+++ u8083 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ EMMI +++$+++ Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
L568119 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!
L568118 +++$+++ u8083 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ EMMI +++$+++ That's because you had a proper upbringing.
L568490 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ What is it with you, David? Where are your feelings? Where's your hatred, your disgust? Where's your fucking outrage, David?
L568489 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
L568488 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
L568487 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
L568486 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
L568485 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
L568484 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ With more what? More what?
L568483 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
L568482 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Yeah.
L568481 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Can I ask you a favour, Major?
L568471 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ My manner? Why don't you go downstairs, get a cup of coffee and calm down? What's the matter, Emmi? What's going on with you? What's wrong?
L568470 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Your manner.
L568469 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ What?
L568464 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
L568463 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwängler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
L568458 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Not so, Counsellor. That secretary of yours, she wasn't just your secretary, she procured women for you, didn't she? As many and as often as you wanted.
L568457 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ and totally irrelevant.
L568456 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ You bet.
L568455 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
L568454 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true?
L568449 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ David, what are you Counsel for the Defence now?  Did you hear the question?
L568448 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
L568447 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life.  How many illegitimate children do you have?
L568410 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Why not show Dr. Furtwängler the evidence. It may refresh his memory?
L568409 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Yes, David?
L568153 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yes. What was the orchestra's reaction when they asked you to play for Hitler's birthday?
L568152 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ You have a question for Helmuth, David?
L568137 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ It's a bet. You're the witness, Emmi.
L568136 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Five minutes.
L568135 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.
L568134 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ That's big of him.
L568133 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
L568132 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
L568131 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
L568130 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ What's that mean?
L568129 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
L568128 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ So what is it?
L568127 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yes.
L568126 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive?
L568098 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ They're trying to sort out some of the works of art the Nazis stole from occupied territories. Who really owns what? That's Colonel Dymshitz, on the far side.
L568097 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ What the hell are they doing?
L568096 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ 'Dim-shits'?
L568095 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
L568094 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ So, what does the Russki want?
L568093 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I guess it's possible.
L568092 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated?
L568049 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Don't. This is like a criminal investigation, David. Musicians, morticians, doctors, lawyers, butchers, clerks. They're all the same.
L568048 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Some.
L568047 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ I guess you admire musicians.
L568042 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped in '36. My parents, they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia. They were to follow. But they delayed and...
L568041 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Where you from, David?
L568040 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
L568039 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I guess so, sir.
L568038 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
L568037 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
L568036 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ I'm Steve. What's your name?
L568035 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm very sorry.
L568034 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
L568033 +++$+++ u8081 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major Arnold. Sir.
L568376 +++$+++ u8082 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DYMSHITZ +++$+++ Then you're going to kill me.
L568375 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal.
L568374 +++$+++ u8082 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DYMSHITZ +++$+++ Duty? I am sorry, duty? Duty fucking duty. Trouble is, you Americans want everybody to live like you. We liberated Berlin, Major Steve, not you. Our duty also is to bring back the best of German culture.
L568373 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ I have a duty.
L568372 +++$+++ u8082 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DYMSHITZ +++$+++ Let Furtwängler go. Please.
L568371 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ No can do.
L568370 +++$+++ u8082 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DYMSHITZ +++$+++ I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwängler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.
L568369 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ What museum?
L568368 +++$+++ u8082 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DYMSHITZ +++$+++ And suddenly, Steve, suddenly you notice that they like you. They honour you, suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world, for example.
L568367 +++$+++ u8082 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DYMSHITZ +++$+++ There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
L568366 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
L568365 +++$+++ u8082 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DYMSHITZ +++$+++ In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
L568364 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
L568363 +++$+++ u8082 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DYMSHITZ +++$+++ Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
L568362 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
L568361 +++$+++ u8082 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DYMSHITZ +++$+++ Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
L568360 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Colonel. He had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs.
L568358 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ That's why he didn't get the hell out of here when he had the chance! I put that to him, he couldn't answer. Why didn't he go and direct in America, like that Italian, Toscanini.
L568357 +++$+++ u8082 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DYMSHITZ +++$+++ A great artist will have great privileges in a Russian zone.
L568355 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ We're dealing with degenerates here.
L568354 +++$+++ u8082 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DYMSHITZ +++$+++ Furtwängler's in a different category.
L568353 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ I was in Vienna. I had with me an Austrian chauffeur, Max his name was, he spent time in the camps. We were looking at these Viennese cleaning up the bomb damage, scavenging for rotting food, butt ends, anything. I said, 'To think a million of these people came out to welcome Adolf on the day he entered the city, a million of 'em, and now look at 'em.'  And Max said, 'Oh, not these people, Major. These people were all at home hiding Jews in their attics.' You get the point, Colonel? The point is they're all full of shit.
L568111 +++$+++ u8082 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DYMSHITZ +++$+++ I've had two meetings with him. He's a great musician. Maybe the greatest conductor in the world. His Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert - unequalled.
L568110 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Not yet.
L568109 +++$+++ u8082 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DYMSHITZ +++$+++ So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwängler?
L568108 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Colonel. Pleasure.
L568107 +++$+++ u8082 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ DYMSHITZ +++$+++ Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz. I'm glad to see you.
L568480 +++$+++ u8083 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ EMMI +++$+++ I would like to go now, please.
L568479 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
L568478 +++$+++ u8083 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ EMMI +++$+++ But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
L568477 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.
L568476 +++$+++ u8083 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ EMMI +++$+++ I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
L568475 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ What's not right?
L568474 +++$+++ u8083 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ EMMI +++$+++ I can't do this. It's not right.
L568473 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ What is this, Emmi?
L568472 +++$+++ u8083 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ EMMI +++$+++ I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all.
L568385 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it.
L568384 +++$+++ u8083 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ EMMI +++$+++ Of course.
L568383 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Do you know where the Adagio begins?
L568382 +++$+++ u8083 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ EMMI +++$+++ Bruckner's Seventh, Major.
L568167 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down, Emmi. We're going to keep him waiting, too.
L568166 +++$+++ u8083 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ EMMI +++$+++ Major, Major... he's here ...
L568045 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Come in, Emmi, this is your office, too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David Wills.
L568044 +++$+++ u8083 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ EMMI +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L568031 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ You tell him nothing, Emmi. If he calls again, you say you know nothing. We're gonna keep him waiting while I get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses. And, God help me, with Beethoven.
L568030 +++$+++ u8083 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ EMMI +++$+++ The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwängler?
L568029 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ What's in those files?
L568028 +++$+++ u8083 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ EMMI +++$+++ No. Ours was damaged.
L568027 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
L568026 +++$+++ u8083 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ EMMI +++$+++ But... he only wrote nine, Major.
L568025 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Mine's the Eleventh.
L568024 +++$+++ u8083 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ EMMI +++$+++ Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
L568023 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Think you can get me any of that?
L568021 +++$+++ u8083 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ EMMI +++$+++ There have been messages for you.  A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is.
L568020 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Steve.
L568015 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ And your father was executed.
L568014 +++$+++ u8083 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ EMMI +++$+++ Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
L568013 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Your mother, too.
L568012 +++$+++ u8083 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ EMMI +++$+++ My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.
L568011 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Says here because of your father. What's that mean?
L568010 +++$+++ u8083 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ EMMI +++$+++ Three months.
L568009 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?
L568008 +++$+++ u8083 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ EMMI +++$+++ Yes.
L568007 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ You do shorthand and typing?
L568006 +++$+++ u8083 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ EMMI +++$+++ Yes.
L568005 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ You live here, in Berlin?
L568516 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Look around you. See the country you served. Look at people who had real courage, who took risks, who risked their lives. Like Emmi's father.
L568515 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?
L568514 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? They had orchestras in the camps. They played Beethoven, Wagner. The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. I don't understand the Germans' relationship with music. What do you need music for? Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated? Yes, I blame you for not getting hanged, I blame you for your cowardice. You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and I say to you, lies!
L568511 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ I'll tell you, then. The last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal Hitler had shot himself. Listen to it.  They listen. Did they pick little K's recording? Did they pick some other conductor? No, they picked you, and why? Because you represented them so beautifully. When the Devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. You were everything to them.
L568510 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ How can I know such a thing?
L568507 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Who's conducting?
L568506 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
L568505 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Okay, so what is it?
L568504 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ Of course I know what that is.
L568503 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Do you know what that is?
L568496 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
L568495 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
L568494 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ Those attitudes do not exist in me.
L568493 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But--  I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?
L568467 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ No, that's your problem, Wilhelm. You understand nothing. We'll call you. Go!
L568466 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ I don't understand what you mean.
L568465 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Okay, Wilhelm, go home now. Go home and think about these past twelve years.
L568462 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ But you see what I'm getting at? You get a gorgeous house, you're highly paid. What are you gonna do, stay or leave? One voice comes back at me: stay!
L568461 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
L568460 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
L568459 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ Stop this, please, stop this now!
L568453 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ You like the women, don't you, Wilhelm?
L568452 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
L568451 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ What?
L568450 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ I have illegitimate children.
L568446 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ Of course there was a conspiracy against me, a campaign - even abroad.
L568445 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?
L568444 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ This is absolute nonsense!
L568443 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Come on, admit it. K worried you, didn't he? He always worried you. In 1942, he's thirty-four years old, you're already fifty-six. And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book,  The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K.
L568441 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ Yes, that's what happened.
L568440 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
L568439 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
L568436 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
L568435 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L568434 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad.
L568433 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ I have no idea.
L568432 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ And what happened to Von der Nul?
L568431 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
L568430 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ And what did he say?
L568429 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
L568428 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?
L568427 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ That's an outrageous lie!
L568426 +++$+++ u8088 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
L568425 +++$+++ u8084 +++$+++ m548 +++$+++ FURTWÄNGLER +++$+++ Yes, I know who he is.
