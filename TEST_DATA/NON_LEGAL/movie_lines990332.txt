L526772 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.
L526771 +++$+++ u7812 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?
L526770 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
L526769 +++$+++ u7813 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
L526768 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Geologists?  At a plane crash?
L526767 +++$+++ u7813 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
L526766 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Who's everyone?
L526765 +++$+++ u7813 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Must be another Johnson then.  Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.
L526764 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Know what?
L526763 +++$+++ u7813 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ You mean you don't know?
L526762 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What report?
L526761 +++$+++ u7813 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Huh?
L526760 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What report?
L526759 +++$+++ u7813 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
L526758 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You've heard of me?
L526757 +++$+++ u7813 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
L526756 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors.
L527522 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
L527521 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said earlier -- we were his friends --
L527479 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I'm not sure.
L527478 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there?
L527475 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Not that I know of.  Why?
L527474 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
L527473 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
L527472 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What was it?
L527449 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Why's that?
L527448 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.
L527424 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ When he uses a phrase like "I am Happy", I think we should think twice about what we ask him.
L527423 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You want to put him on your couch, Norman.  Grill him about his childhood?
L527402 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Unless it's an act.
L527401 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Well, he's polite.
L527367 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.
L527366 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
L527365 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Inside the sphere.  Look, that's the vertical torso, three legs, two arms.  There's no head, so I'm guessing the creature's head is located within the torso itself, you know?
L527364 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ The creature?
L527363 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature.
L527362 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ This is like nursery school.
L527361 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Try this one.
L527360 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Please, Ted.
L527359 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Squint harder.
L527358 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I don't see anything.
L527357 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
L527356 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You mean a picture?
L527355 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
L527354 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Like what?
L527353 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things.
L527011 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Still, make a note I recognized that.
L527010 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
L527009 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how it would have a button.
L526973 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
L526972 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You want me to try?
L526902 +++$+++ u7814 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ He's a pussy.
L526901 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ He wasn't feeling well.
L526754 +++$+++ u7815 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ WIFE +++$+++ They never used to send a Navy car.
L526753 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I don't know.
L526752 +++$+++ u7815 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ WIFE +++$+++ Was it a military crash?
L526751 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What?
L526750 +++$+++ u7815 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ WIFE +++$+++ There's a U.S.  Navy car outside, Norman.
L526749 +++$+++ u7815 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ WIFE +++$+++ How are you getting to the airport? You need money for the bus?
L526748 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
L526747 +++$+++ u7815 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ WIFE +++$+++ Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
L526746 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Four.  Four years --
L526745 +++$+++ u7815 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ WIFE +++$+++ Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
L526744 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Don't be so supportive, honey.
L526743 +++$+++ u7815 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ WIFE +++$+++ In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
L526742 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
L526741 +++$+++ u7815 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ WIFE +++$+++ There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
L526740 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You seen my suitcase?
L526739 +++$+++ u7815 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ WIFE +++$+++ What kind of a crash was it?
L542275 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ May the Force be with you.
L542274 +++$+++ u7821 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ We'll be back before you are, old man.
L542273 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything.
L542257 +++$+++ u7821 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ I'm not going out there.
L542256 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
L542255 +++$+++ u7821 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.
L542251 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ It's not good... unless I could find the Crystal.  Then it could be very good.
L542250 +++$+++ u7821 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Is that good or bad?
L542249 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal.
L542224 +++$+++ u7821 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ What do you want with our scan-proof lockers?
L542223 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ ... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
L542222 +++$+++ u7821 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ I'll get the information.
L542221 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ All right then, we'll use your plan.
L542220 +++$+++ u7821 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.
L542219 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...
L542218 +++$+++ u7821 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly.  I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in?
L542206 +++$+++ u7821 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Not bad.
L542205 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You have your father's style.  You've done very well.
L542202 +++$+++ u7821 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ I'm not afraid of anything...
L542201 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Fear is their greatest weapon.
L542200 +++$+++ u7821 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.
L542198 +++$+++ u7821 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ This isn't a game, you know.
L542197 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault.
L542186 +++$+++ u7821 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Anything I want!  Now that's interesting.
L542185 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...
L542184 +++$+++ u7821 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ How much do you think she's talking about?
L542183 +++$+++ u7821 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ I'm beginning not to like you.
L542182 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I think there are some things we should talk about.
L542181 +++$+++ u7821 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Who's going to pay me then?
L542180 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
L542177 +++$+++ u7821 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
L542176 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ No, not anymore.
L542175 +++$+++ u7821 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
L542174 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
L542173 +++$+++ u7821 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
L542172 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.
L542171 +++$+++ u7821 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.
L542170 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ The Empire must have gotten here first.
L542162 +++$+++ u7821 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.
L542161 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Well, we'll see...
L542090 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
L542089 +++$+++ u7821 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?
L542433 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.
L542432 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ The Kiber Crystal.
L542254 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I'm not going alone!
L542253 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal.
L542252 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ What about the princess?
L542216 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
L542215 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
L542214 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
L542213 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
L542212 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
L542211 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I can't see!  How can I fight?
L542192 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I didn't say that, but it appears to be a logical alternative.
L542191 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You mean we should go after her!...
L542190 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.
L542165 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ He can't find Organa Major.
L542164 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ What is it?
L542157 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ All you have to do is lose your thinking self.  Don't focus on anything.  Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier.  You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go.  You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either.
L542156 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ What do I do?
L542155 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
L542154 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Are you sure you don't need it?
L542142 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
L542141 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Are you all right?
L542140 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
L542139 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ What's wrong?  What's happening?
L542138 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...
L542137 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
L542136 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.
L542135 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?
L542117 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ He's bluffing...
L542116 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
L542094 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Five, maybe.  Let me handle it.
L542093 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?
L542061 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ There are two halves of the Force of Others.  One is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it.  But the others half will kill you if you aren't careful.  This negative side of the Force is called the Bogan, which is where the expression came from, and it is the part that is used by the Dark Lords to destroy their opponents.  Both halves are always present.  The Force is on your right, the Bogan is on your left.  The Kiber Crystal can amplify either one.  The Crystal Darth stole was the last one in the possession of the Jedi.  When he joined the Sith, the power of the Dark Lords was completed.
L542060 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
L542059 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ They use the Bogan Force.
L542058 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
L542057 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
L542056 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ That's where my father was killed.
L542055 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
L542054 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
L542053 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
L542052 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ How can you store an energy field within you?
L542051 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
L542050 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
L542049 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
L542047 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ It means you'd better get some rest. We'll be leaving for Mos Eisley first thing in the morning.  The trip will be difficult and dangerous, but it's the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to Organa Major.  Now go on!
L542046 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L542045 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ That is not a human decision, not your or mine.
L542044 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Could I learn to feel it?
L542043 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
L542042 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You mean I generate an energy field?
L542041 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.
L542040 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
L542039 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.
L542034 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Not any more!
L542033 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!
L542032 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
L542031 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
L542030 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
L542028 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ My father told me many stories about you.  He said if I was ever in trouble, to come here... I need your help.
L542027 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
L542026 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
L542025 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You could put it that way.
L542024 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You saw through me?
L542023 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I know that.
L542022 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.
L542021 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...
L542020 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.
L542019 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.
L542018 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I don't see why.  I don't believe we've ever met.
L542016 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.
L542015 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?
L542014 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.
L542013 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Who are you anyway?
L542009 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Of course.  I'm a Bendu officer.
L542008 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Oh, so you're a warrior then?
L542007 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.
L542000 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You're lucky those Tuskens didn't boil you before they hung you out to dry.  They're not the friendly sort. You'd best be moving on before they come back.
L541999 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
L541998 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.
L541996 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess!  What happened?
L541995 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
L541994 +++$+++ u7816 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Good morning!
L541933 +++$+++ u7817 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BIGGS +++$+++ Just be warned, that things aren't always as they seem... especially the starforce recruiting posters.
L541932 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
L541931 +++$+++ u7817 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BIGGS +++$+++ The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
L541930 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
L541929 +++$+++ u7817 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ BIGGS +++$+++ I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...
L541910 +++$+++ u7824 +++$+++ m529 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ But there was a lot of firing earlier...
