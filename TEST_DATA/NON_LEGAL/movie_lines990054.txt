L330576 +++$+++ u6159 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ ROLAND +++$+++ You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I went up there to live."
L330575 +++$+++ u6157 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ But why?
L330574 +++$+++ u6159 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ ROLAND +++$+++ Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived.  And the second greatest predator must take him down.
L330572 +++$+++ u6157 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I don't care about my life.  But if I'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger --
L330571 +++$+++ u6159 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ ROLAND +++$+++ So the truth is more important to you than your life?
L330570 +++$+++ u6157 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
L330569 +++$+++ u6159 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ ROLAND +++$+++ It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
L330568 +++$+++ u6157 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Because it exists.
L330567 +++$+++ u6159 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ ROLAND +++$+++ Why should they?
L330566 +++$+++ u6157 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ So that others would know about this place?
L330565 +++$+++ u6159 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ ROLAND +++$+++ Why did you come here?
L330564 +++$+++ u6157 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
L330563 +++$+++ u6159 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ ROLAND +++$+++ Feeling a bit blue, are we?
L330562 +++$+++ u6157 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together.
L330561 +++$+++ u6159 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ ROLAND +++$+++ What's that?
L330560 +++$+++ u6157 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
L330556 +++$+++ u6157 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ We'd never make it past the raptors. Trust me, I have some experience in this matter.
L330555 +++$+++ u6159 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ ROLAND +++$+++ Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
L330554 +++$+++ u6157 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
L330686 +++$+++ u6157 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Birdshit?
L330685 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ These formations.  They're dried --
L330684 +++$+++ u6157 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ What?
L330683 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Ian.  It's guano.
L330590 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Ian, they will misplace our evidence, shoot holes in our testimony, and say some special effects genius created the animals.  The only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a T-rex in the middle of times Square.
L330589 +++$+++ u6157 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Maybe.  Maybe not.
L330588 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.
L330510 +++$+++ u6157 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ They're pushing us over the cliff.
L330509 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ What?!
L330508 +++$+++ u6157 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Oh, God.
L330504 +++$+++ u6157 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back.  I'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now.  This expedition is over.
L330503 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
L330502 +++$+++ u6157 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish?
L330492 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I swear to God, it works with lions sometimes!  There we are -- your baby is free --
L330491 +++$+++ u6157 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Are you insane?!
L330490 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows --
L330487 +++$+++ u6157 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
L330486 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
L330470 +++$+++ u6157 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Think fast, Sarah.
L330469 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
L330468 +++$+++ u6157 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Can you set up?
L330393 +++$+++ u6157 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ John Hammond.
L330392 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Funded by whom?
L330391 +++$+++ u6157 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
L330342 +++$+++ u6157 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I'm her father.
L330341 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
L330340 +++$+++ u6157 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
L330335 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?
L330334 +++$+++ u6157 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!
L330318 +++$+++ u6157 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ That's a scientific impossibility, you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study, you also change.
L330317 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact.
L330712 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Where's Ian?
L330711 +++$+++ u6158 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Where's Kelly?
L330621 +++$+++ u6158 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ JUMP!
L330620 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ WHAT ARE YOU-
L330499 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ No.
L330498 +++$+++ u6158 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One "no" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.  Well?  Do we go on? Immediately:
L330479 +++$+++ u6158 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I'm trying!
L330478 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Hold it down, Nick!
L330474 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ We'll kill it with too much, we'll put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm almost done.  Damn it, I need another adhesive, something pliable I can --
L330473 +++$+++ u6158 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Give it more morphine!
L330467 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.
L330466 +++$+++ u6158 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ That little black line?
L330385 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
L330384 +++$+++ u6158 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
L330351 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day.  That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it-
L330350 +++$+++ u6158 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ The kid scores with cheap sentiment.
L330328 +++$+++ u6158 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Oh, no!
L330327 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ -- way we could safely --
L330293 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I believe in him.
L330292 +++$+++ u6158 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
L330291 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Ian's a very good friend of mine.
L330290 +++$+++ u6158 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
L330289 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ You think this is all a joke?
L330288 +++$+++ u6158 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
L330287 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Very noble of you.  You don't think you're bringing that thing onto the island, do you?
L330286 +++$+++ u6158 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
L330285 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
L330284 +++$+++ u6158 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.
L330283 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ So what's your story, Nick?
L330660 +++$+++ u6159 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ ROLAND +++$+++ Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait.
L330659 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ You've got to be kidding.
L330633 +++$+++ u6159 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ ROLAND +++$+++ Can the kid walk?
L330632 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Ask her.
L330600 +++$+++ u6159 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ ROLAND +++$+++ You go if you like, but we're not waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!
L330599 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ We have to send someone to look for him!
L330543 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Move where?  Our boat's not coming for two days, your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send --
L330542 +++$+++ u6159 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ ROLAND +++$+++ If we can't stay in the rex's territory, we have to move tonight.
L330541 +++$+++ u6159 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ ROLAND +++$+++ None of that matters.  Our communications equipment's been destroyed.  If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face --
L330540 +++$+++ u6160 +++$+++ m410 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.
L332224 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Theoretically, yeah , but we've never shut down the whole system.  It may not come back at all.
L332223 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ - - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
L332222 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
L332221 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ We're talking, my dear, about a calculated risk, which is the only option left to us.  We will never find the command NEDRY used.  He covered his tracks far too well, and I think it's obvious he's not coming back.  So shutting down the system - -
L332003 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Where did the vehicles stop?
L332002 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Phones are out too.
L331990 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ The monitors are failing.
L331989 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!
L331988 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Fences are failing, all over the park!  A few minor systems, he said!
L331987 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ What now?
L331986 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
L331975 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Well, Nedry said a few systems would go off-line, didn't he?
L331974 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ The door security systems are shutting down.
L331973 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ What?
L331964 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ It could have been worse, John.  It could have been a lot worse.
L331963 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
L331962 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage.
L331957 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.
L331956 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
L331917 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Damn!
L331916 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
L331912 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ It's not worth taking the chance, John.
L331911 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You're sure we have to?
L331910 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course. We're going to have to cut the tour short, I'm afraid. Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off.
L331879 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Stop the program!  Stop the program!
L331878 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Uh - - Mr. Hammond - -
L332242 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ 'Bout thirty seconds.
L332241 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ How long will this take?
L332232 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ No trick to it.  Just stop running the program.  Leaving them unattended.
L332231 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ How would we cut off the lysine?
L332230 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.
L332226 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
L332225 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ But would we get the phones back?
L332220 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?
L332219 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -
L332077 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Two million - - great.  That would help.  Oh good, that'll take no time.
L332076 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ Uh - - about two million.
L332075 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ How many lines of code are there?
L332074 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What one?
L332073 +++$+++ u6161 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ARNOLD +++$+++ I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
L332072 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
L331626 +++$+++ u6171 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ NEDRY +++$+++ I got an eighteen minute window.  Eighteen minutes, and your company catches up on ten years of research.
L331625 +++$+++ u6162 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ DODGSON +++$+++ I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
L331624 +++$+++ u6171 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ NEDRY +++$+++ That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
L331623 +++$+++ u6162 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ DODGSON +++$+++ Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
L331622 +++$+++ u6171 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ NEDRY +++$+++ What?  No menthol?
L331620 +++$+++ u6171 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ NEDRY +++$+++ How am I supposed to transport them?
L331619 +++$+++ u6162 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ DODGSON +++$+++ Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
L331618 +++$+++ u6171 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ NEDRY +++$+++ Oh, I'll get 'em all.
L331616 +++$+++ u6171 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ NEDRY +++$+++ Dodgson, Dodgson.  We got Dodgson here!  See, nobody cares.  Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
L331615 +++$+++ u6162 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ DODGSON +++$+++ You shouldn't use my name.
L331950 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?
L331949 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.
L331887 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ Anybody at all.  Feel free to speak up.
L331886 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Yours was fully illustrated, honey.
L331883 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
L331882 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?
L331781 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?  You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous.  You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if necessary.
L331780 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr. Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?
L331676 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ Shhhhh!
L331675 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
L331952 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others.
L331951 +++$+++ u6167 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
L331907 +++$+++ u6167 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ You won't be able to miss them.  Can't miss them.
L331906 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
L331905 +++$+++ u6167 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Pretty sure.
L331904 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Are you sure?
L331903 +++$+++ u6167 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Yes.  We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them.
L331902 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
L331901 +++$+++ u6167 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ They are?  I'll be damned.
L331900 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ These are dilated.  Take a look.
L331899 +++$+++ u6167 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
L331898 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Six weeks?
L331897 +++$+++ u6167 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
L332312 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Okay, I'm following the tubing.  I'm going down a passage way.  How long does this stuff go for?  Could you guys talk a little bit to me?
L332311 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
L332310 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Mr. Arnold?  He's not answering me.  Okay I'm on the grating.
L332286 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Look.
L332285 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -
L332284 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Why?
L332283 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ But you know, I should  really be the one going .
L332274 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ John....
L332273 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.
L332192 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?
L332191 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Once we have control again we - -
L332190 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ John, John.  John, you're still building onto that Flea Circus, that illusion.  And now you're adding onto it by what you're doing here.  That's the illusion.
L332189 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You're absolutely right.  Yes, you're right.  Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious.  	We're over- dependent on automation, I can see that now.  But that's all correctable for the next time around.
L332188 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
L332187 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ But with this place, I - - I wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  An aim devoid of  merit.
L332186 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  "I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade... 
L332185 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Carousel.
L332184 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ They'll all be fine.  Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?
L332183 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Malcolm's okay for now.  I gave him a shot of morphine.
L331747 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ We're - - still perfecting a viewing system.  The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting.
L331746 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Alan, these aren't bones anymore.
L331744 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Give time, they'll out draw the T-rex.  Guarantee it.
L331743 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Oh my God.
L331742 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Fascinating animals, fascinating.
L331714 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Could I have a tissue please?
L331713 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Oh my God.
L331712 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ There you are.  Out you come.
L331598 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
L331597 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I have samples all over the kitchen. 
L331596 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?
L331595 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Did I say jerk?
L332361 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
L332360 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
L332359 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You can't hold it by yourself!
L332358 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks!
L332351 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
L332350 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?
