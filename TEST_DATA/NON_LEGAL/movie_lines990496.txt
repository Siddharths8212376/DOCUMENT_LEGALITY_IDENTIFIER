L642852 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think?
L642851 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
L642850 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ What are you doing?
L642848 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Do me one favor —— if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.
L642847 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?
L642840 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.
L642839 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ What happened when he was 17?
L642838 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.
L642837 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?
L642835 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ I know who would know.
L642834 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.  The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?
L642833 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
L642832 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better —— to improve upon what was already done.
L642831 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
L642830 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ He was re—enacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
L642827 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.
L642826 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ You ready for this?
L642823 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Fine. Never felt better in my life.  See, I'm a good liar.
L642822 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ You all right?
L642821 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Every time I said it, it was. I never really thought I was going to make it.
L642820 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ It wasn't a lie.
L642819 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive.  Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie.
L642806 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ What you need is a collar.
L642805 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ I don't need a baby—sitter.
L642720 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.
L642719 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.
L642717 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Enough!
L642716 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
L642715 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Go to hell.
L642714 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
L642713 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
L642712 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
L642711 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
L642710 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ That's not true, Parker.
L642709 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it —— I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
L642708 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
L642707 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ John died.
L642706 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?
L642705 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ A little less than yesterday.
L642704 +++$+++ u8802 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ MADISON +++$+++ No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
L642703 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ You actually listen to all those tapes?
L643276 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD!
L643275 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend?
L643201 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ I really did think I was still in reality. At least, until now.  Beam me up, Scotty!
L643200 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L643199 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ Thank-you, Daryl.  You had me going for quite a while there, sport.
L643198 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ I've got some final preparations to take care of—— Checking his watch, he stops suddenly.
L643197 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Aren't you going to watch with me?
L643196 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ Let's just say I'm sending a very clear message to his Re—Election Rally...
L643195 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ You are going after Mayor Bennett.
L643194 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ There you go —— best seat in the house.
L643191 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ I thought you liked me being in the audience. Don't you want me to see it?
L643190 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ It's really too bad you have to miss the Grand Finale.
L643169 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ My...secret.
L643168 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ You can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is. Where is it?!
L643167 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Where did you plant the C-4?!
L643166 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
L643165 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ What C-4...was Cox talking about?
L643154 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Where did you plant the C-4?!
L643153 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
L643152 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ What C-4...was Cox talking about?
L643143 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Why's that?
L643142 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you——
L643077 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ You really are pathetic, you know that? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. He is nothing compared to me.
L643076 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
L643075 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to?
L643074 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD!
L643073 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
L643072 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!
L642963 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ Who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands?
L642962 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ You and me have nothing in common.
L642961 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ I must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison.  You know, we have so much in common —— we have such history together ——I've been thinking we should become friends.
L642960 +++$+++ u8803 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
L642959 +++$+++ u8805 +++$+++ m597 +++$+++ SID 6.7 +++$+++ The symphony of collision...
