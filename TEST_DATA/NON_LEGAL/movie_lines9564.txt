L52309 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
L52308 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
L52307 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Right.
L52306 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Don't tell me I don't have a choice!
L52305 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ We don't have a choice.
L52304 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Forget it!
L52303 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yes.
L52302 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ And you want to use me to get him?
L52301 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
L52300 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Why?
L52299 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yes.
L52298 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ He wants to kill you?
L52297 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Because he is trying to retire me.
L52296 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Why?
L52295 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
L52294 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ So this is something between you and him?
L52293 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
L52292 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Someone hired both of you?
L52291 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Another contractor.
L52290 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Who is that other guy?
L52289 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ If I still was what I used to be, you would not be pointing that at me.
L52288 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ What does that mean?
L52287 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Until a minute ago.
L52286 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ An assassin?
L52285 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ 'Them'?
L52284 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ You're one of them, aren't you?
L52283 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian. There aren't that many.
L52282 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Nikita?
L52281 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ You didn't know anything about me.
L52280 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
L52279 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Okay.  How did you find me?
L52251 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
L52250 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ You want me to pump?
L52249 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Turn off the engine.
L52248 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Now what?
L52244 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Now you understand why I'm here.
L52243 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Ten million --
L52242 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more.
L52240 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars.
L52239 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
L52238 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Twenty large?  That's all?
L52235 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I'm part of the game, just like you.
L52234 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
L52233 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yeah.
L52232 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Bullshit.
L52231 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Yeah?
L52230 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I work for the government.
L52229 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
L52228 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
L52227 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ What?  How did you know I had a cat?
L52226 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Nikita?  She helped me find you.
L52222 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Where are we going?
L52221 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Get on the expressway.
L52218 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ One hour per man.
L52217 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Um, five.
L52216 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?
L52215 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ What?
L52166 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ A pleasure doing business with you.
L52165 +++$+++ u3800 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Electra --
L52164 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
L52163 +++$+++ u3800 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?
L52162 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
L52161 +++$+++ u3800 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
L52160 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I thought it was interesting --
L52159 +++$+++ u3800 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
L52158 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I wasn't watching television.
L52007 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ Anytime.
L52006 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Thank you.
L52005 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yes.
L52004 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ Is that all you want?
L52002 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ Are you asking me if I believe in another life?
L52001 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Do you believe that?
L52000 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ Then, I'll sail alone.
L51997 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Can you tell me about it?
L51996 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ All the time.
L51995 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Do you ever think about starting over?
L51994 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ No.  They call me, I don't call them.  If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.
L51993 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Do you think about their wives or their families?
L51992 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ Sometimes.
L51991 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
L51990 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ Everyone regrets something.
L51989 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Do you ever regret things you've done?
L51987 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Honesty.
L51986 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ For what?
L51983 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I called because I just want... I need to talk.
L51982 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.
L51980 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ I think you're supposed to answer that question.
L51979 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ You're very good at this aren't you?
L51978 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ Holidays are our busiest days.  No one likes to be alone on holidays. I know I don't.
L51977 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Why are you working today?
L51974 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.
L51973 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Would you like a drink?
L51970 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
L51969 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I prefer it like this.
L51967 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yes.  Please come in.
L51966 +++$+++ u3795 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ESCORT +++$+++ Hi.  Did you call --
L51964 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No.
L51963 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ Look at that.  I haven't watched the sun set in a million years. Do you mind?
L51961 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yeah.
L51960 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
L51959 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yeah.
L51958 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ You mean quit?
L51957 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Why didn't you fade?
L51956 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ Anything.
L51955 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Can I ask you a question?
L51954 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
L51953 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Some.
L51952 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
L51951 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.
L51950 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ What do other guys do?
L51949 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Go ahead.
L51948 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ Can I ask you something?
L51947 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ And an R.C.
L51946 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ I'm thinking about Moonpies.  Ain't that funny?  I haven't had a Moonpie since I was ten years old. Right now, I'm thinking how much I'd love one.
L51945 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ What are you thinking about?
L51944 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
L51943 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Right.
L51942 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
L51941 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Don't know.  That's how it works.
L51939 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ That's exactly what I told myself.
L51938 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
L51937 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ 'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
L51936 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Taken.
L51935 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway?
L51934 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ Shit... oh well.
L51933 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Average.
L51932 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
L51931 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ A dime.
L51930 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
L51929 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ It's a common question.
L51928 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ I know this may seem like a strange question, but can I ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, I know you're a professional, but just for me, I was just wondering.
L51927 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I hope not.
L51926 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ You're pretty famous aren't you?
L51925 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ It's possible.
L51924 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ I think I've heard of you.
L51922 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ I don't know.  Part of me wanted to but part of me always said, 'What's she going to be able to do?'  I don't know.  Maybe I didn't trust her.
L51921 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Why not?
L51920 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that.  'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  I never would though.  Not really.
L51919 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Sure.
L51918 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ Hey, do you mind if I talk a little?  I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess.
L51915 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Just a little ways.  Up to those trees.
L51914 +++$+++ u3796 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ KETCHAM +++$+++ How much farther?
L52698 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Thank you.
L52697 +++$+++ u3797 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ Of course, senor.
L52696 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
L52695 +++$+++ u3797 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ Excellent, senor.  If you could follow me?

L52683 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ That's correct.
L52682 +++$+++ u3797 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ You wish to close this account today?
L53413 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ No, better than me. You know, I have many friends, you should meet more of them.

L53407 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ It won't last, believe me. And you, when will you go back to the States?
L53406 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Well, he sure seems fired up all of a sudden.
L53405 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ I don't know, I don't care. I see too much of him and he's changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he's been doing nothing for months, like he doesn't care about anything, including me.
L53404 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
L53403 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.
L53402 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ So how's your work?
L53375 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ No, you guys are great together. He'll come through, I'm sure.
L53374 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ I used to think he was right about a lot of things but now I don't know. I thought he was going somewhere but now I think I am wasting my time.
L53373 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ I don't know. It's kind of underground. Doug's right, there's too much crap in this town.
L53372 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
L53371 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Cheers Katka!
L53369 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Hey Doug, you want a beer?
L53368 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ A coke, if they have it?
L53367 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ What are you having?
L53332 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ And pay for their drinks occasionally.
L53331 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ That's true Doug, writers are supposed to write.
L54267 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Here!
L54266 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ What about me?
L54265 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I should have read the fine print.  I love you Holly, thanks.
L54264 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Some deal you did there!
L54263 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ God, I think I need a holiday.
L54141 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ You could give me your baseball, so I can drive this bastard nuts.....He's been playing chequers for eight hours and still hasn't won a game.
L54140 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Sure....Anything else I can do for you?
L54139 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ If I cut a deal, I'm not staying in this country and I want Holly to come with me. So, if she doesn't come here today, you're going to have to get her to me tomorrow; after I call, promise?
L54138 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ You're in the clear, keep it that way, I'll be okay.
L54137 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Doug, I can't just leave you!
L54136 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ 42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.

L54133 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Yeah, Dave Walters.
L54132 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn't work. You'd better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know someone with a phone?
L54131 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ What do you want me to do?
L54130 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Siberia.
L54129 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ And if you're wrong.
L54128 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.
L54127 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Do you want me to see what's on them?
L54126 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there.
L54125 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Yeah, somewhere?
L54124 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?
L54123 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ It was all in Czech wasn't it.
L54122 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Did you see anything in the files?
L54121 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.
L54120 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Lucky break!
L54119 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
