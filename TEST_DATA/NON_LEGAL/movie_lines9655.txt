L121234 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ We had a deal. Remember that?  He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave.
L121233 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I mean she's only sober about two hours a day. It's usually from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon. And if I gave her her money and her jewels now, you know what she's gonna do? She's gonna piss it all away in about a year, and then where will she be?  Where would you be then? Comin' right back to me, right back to me.  Or finding some other excuse to come and I - I -

L120699 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
L120698 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ No, you don't.
L120697 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yes, I - yes, I do.

L120693 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
L120692 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Okay, okay.
L120691 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ If not for me, at least for Amy.
L120690 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Okay.
L120689 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ It's okay.  Look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.

L120686 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I said, you can't make me stop caring about people.
L120685 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ What? What?!
L120684 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ You can't make me stop caring...
L120683 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah, how do I know?
L120682 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy!
L120681 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ What?
L120680 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ You didn't have to beat him up!
L120679 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. And that's when I have extreme pain. I had a three-month supply. What'd you do with 'em?
L120678 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I didn't take your pills.
L120677 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
L120676 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Huh?
L120589 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Didn't. No, instead, what did he say? 'Fuck him. Take him for everything he's got.'
L120588 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ No, he didn't.
L120587 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him?  He didn't say, 'Don't get married, I'll be right down, we'll get married.'  He didn't say that to you, did he?
L120571 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Good, so then you could tell me what the money is for.
L120570 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ You can trust me.
L120569 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?
L120568 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad?
L120567 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ What are you talkin' a- ?
L120566 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
L120565 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?
L120564 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ No.
L120563 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Huh?  Well, you know what? Now, I want you to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat?
L120561 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Who's fighting? I mean, I'm, you know, tell me what it's for.
L120560 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
L120559 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
L120558 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
L120557 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Why do you need that much?
L120556 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Yeah.
L120555 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?
L120554 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Well, I would, you know, Sam. It's just that... well, I need more than that. I need twenty-five thousand.
L120553 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
L120552 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
L120551 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ What do you need?
L120550 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Okay, want to go with Mommy?
L120292 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...they didn't know what really moved her.
L120291 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Oh, fabulous.
L120290 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ But as much as they loved her...
L120289 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Hey, do you want to see this one? Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.  Put your arm in there.
L120273 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ She could be the most charming woman you ever saw. People loved to be around her.
L120272 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Hi. Nice to see you.
L120130 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ So, I put two million in cash in a Los Angeles bank under the name of Mr and Mrs Tom Collins. This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money.
L120129 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
L120128 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.
L120125 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ All this stuff doesn't mean anything. Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life.
L120124 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Okay.
L120123 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
L120122 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
L120121 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank.
L120120 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad, either.
L120119 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?
L120118 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?
L120115 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Oh...
L120114 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ It's nice isn't it?
L120113 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Oh, it's so soft.

L120111 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ You're kidding? My God. What is it?
L120104 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Okay.
L120103 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Want to go? Let's go back in.
L120102 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Yeah. Yeah.

L120096 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Yeah.
L120095 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?
L120094 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I'm okay. I just -  You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?
L120093 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
L120092 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I'm not crying. 
L120091 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Why're you crying?
L120090 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Yeah.
L120089 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You all right?
L120064 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Just what I said. You'll be set up for the rest of your life. That I can promise you.  Want to take a chance?
L120063 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
L120062 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
L120061 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
L120060 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
L120059 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Understand?  I'm sorry.
L120058 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I - I - I...
L120057 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
L120056 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah, I know all that.
L120055 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
L120054 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
L120053 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
L120052 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
L120051 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ You got the wrong girl, Sam.
L120050 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me?  I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family.
L120049 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ What, are you trying to handicap me?
L120048 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?
L120047 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot.
L119841 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Good luck.
L119840 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.
