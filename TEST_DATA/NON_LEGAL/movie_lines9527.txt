L28844 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ - and for my feelings in particular! For my play, my career - and now for a frightened, hysterical girl on the eve of her first night in the Theater!
L28843 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I'm a human being, I've got some!
L28842 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I didn't think you would! It seems to me, Karen, that for some tine, now, you've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general-
L28833 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards?
L28832 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Who is it? What's it all about?
L28825 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Nothing...
L28824 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ What's so funny?
L28794 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Not much.
L28793 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say?
L28787 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Nothing much. She apologized.
L28786 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ - well? What happened?
L28716 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
L28715 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ After all, maybe she just wants to apologize...
L28699 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What are you going to wear?
L28698 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Three days, that's for the bourgeois - I see a midnight elopement, waking up a village person...
L28690 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Margo!
L28689 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Well of all-
L28675 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You - for one. I told her you were set on Margo playing the part - and I certainly wouldn't make a change without your approval.
L28674 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Such as?
L28673 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Darling, I didn't promise Eve anything. Just said I thought she'd be fine for the part, but there were some practical difficulties...
L28672 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ They'd die without each other.
L28671 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I'm glad Bill's back.
L28670 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
L28669 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.
L28667 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ The cynicism you refer to, I acquired the day I discovered I was different from little boys!
L28666 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
L28665 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ On her knees, I have no doubt! Very touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts!
L28664 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ All this fuss and hysteria because an impulsive kid got carried away by excitement and the conniving of a professional manure slinger named deWitt! She apologized, didn't she?
L28663 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ It strikes me that Eve's disloyalty and ingratitude must be contagious!
L28662 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Now just a minute!
L28661 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!
L28660 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Now just a minute-
L28659 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Lloyd Richards, you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of "Cora."
L28658 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ For once, to write something and have it realized completely. For once, not to compromise-
L28657 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ With gestures, of course.
L28656 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
L28655 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
L28654 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Eve did mention the play, you know. But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like "Cora," she'd never have the nerve...
L28653 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Now you're quoting Addison. Or Eve.
L28652 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You've got to admit it would be a novelty.
L28651 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
L28650 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ If we could cast it properly, that is...
L28649 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I'm beginning to catch up.
L28648 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ If - instead of waiting until next season to do 'Footsteps on the Ceiling', which is in pretty good shape - and if Margo can be talked into going on tour with 'Aged in Wood' - we could put 'Footsteps...' into production right away...
L28647 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I'm trying hard to follow you.
L28646 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ What with taxes coming up - and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, I've been thinking...
L28645 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ That's quite a change of subject.
L28644 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You know, I've been going over our financial condition - if you'll pardon the expression...
L28642 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I wonder why.
L28641 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
L28640 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ That was a pity...
L28639 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
L28638 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Eve?
L28637 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Eve.
L28636 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Where'd you get all that information?
L28635 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ - it's Addison, from start to finish, it drips with his brand of venom... taking advantage of a kid like that, twisting her words, making her say what he wanted her to say-
L28498 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Don't joke about such things.
L28497 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ What a way to die - trying to get an actress to the theater in time. Tell Max I want to be buried with royalties...
L28496 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You'll break your neck on that ice.
L28487 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Incredible.
L28486 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
L28485 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday!  Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?
L28480 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Just a little skid, that's all. This road's like glass.
L28479 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Lloyd, be careful...
L28475 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Five-fifty-five. We'll be at the station in plenty of time...
L28474 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...
L28473 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ When you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two. It is now five forty-three. When you ask a minute from no, it will be-
L28472 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What time is it?
L28463 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Well. We've spent weekends before with nobody talking...  ... just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects...
L28462 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...
L28461 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ What is?
L28460 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ It's going to be a cozy weekend.
L28459 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Margo. Margo's great. She knows it. That's the trouble. She can play Peck's Bad Boy all she wants, and who's to stop her? Who's to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves?
L28458 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Margo hasn't done badly by it.
L28457 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ - everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...
L28456 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ - don't run out of adjectives, dear.
L28455 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
L28454 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ It's just possible she didn't...
L28453 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
L28452 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ That's on time for Margo.
L28451 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
L28450 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Margo, again...
L28449 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
L28448 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Lloyd, what happened...?
L28106 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ In a minute...
L28105 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Coming?
L28096 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ It's about time we did! It's about time Margo realized that what's attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off.
L28095 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Now let's not get into a big hassle-
L27721 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ If you'd only see her, you're her whole life - you must have spotted her by now, she's always there...
L27720 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
L27719 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You can't put her out, I promised... Margo, you've got to see her, she worships you, it's like something out of a book-
L27707 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Easy, now...
L27706 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ The critics thought so, the audiences certainly think so - packed houses, tickets for months in advance - I can't see that either of Lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any!
L27705 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ - 'at's my loyal little woman.
L27686 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Loud.
L27685 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ How was the concert?
L28823 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ It means I've finally got a life to live! I don't have to play parts I'm too old for - just because I've got nothing to do with my nights!  I know you've made plans. I'll make it up to you, believe me. I'll tour a year with this one, anything - only you do understand - don't you, Lloyd?
L28822 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ What's your being married got to do with it?
L28821 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part. And a fine play. But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady.
L28819 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
L28818 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I don't think I could be.
L28817 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I mean really, deeply angry...
L28816 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ That depends.
L28803 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ She is a louse.
L28802 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You know, she probably means well, after all...
L28801 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ ... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too.
L28707 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Lloyd, I want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...
L28706 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Very discreet. A note right out in the open like that. Next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass...
L28695 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ City Hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters - I see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers...
L28694 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L28683 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Too bad.
L28682 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ It's been quite a night. I understand that your understudy - Miss Harrington - has given her notice.
L28501 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Thank you, Lloyd. Godspeed.
L28500 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ The audience will want its money refunded, believe me.
L28499 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ How fortunate that I have an understudy so ready, so willing and so able to go on.
L28483 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ It's not important whether you do. We are wearing long underwear.
L28482 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I have no intention of having an accident!
L28481 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Karen and I just don't want an accident-
L28394 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ It's about time the piano realized it has not written the concerto!
L28393 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!
L28392 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I shall never understand the weird process by which a body with a voice suddenly fancies itself a mind! Just when exactly does an actress decide they're her words she's saying and her thoughts she's expressing?
L28378 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Then you listened as if someone else had written you play - whom did you have in mind? Sherwood? Arthur Miller? Beaumont and Fletcher?
L28377 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I never said it was!
L28376 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
L28375 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
L28374 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
L28373 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
L28372 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ - in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
L28371 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You've been talking to that venomous fishwife, Addison deWitt-
L28368 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ It's right to the point. Also that it must have sounded so new and fresh to you - so exciting to have the lines read as you wrote them!
L28367 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ That's beside the point.
L28366 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
L28365 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ What do you mean?
L28364 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ To you, too?
L28363 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ She was a revelation...
L28362 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I'm sure.
L28361 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You'd have been proud of her.
L28360 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I'm sure you underestimate yourself, Eve. You always do.  You were about to tell me about Eve...
L28349 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ It seems almost inconceivable that I haven't seen her backstage, but with so many people loitering around... well, well. So Eve is not working for Max after all-  - Max you sly puss.
L28348 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago-
L28347 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
L28346 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ She's your understudy.
L28297 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Just one person. Isn't that so?  You know what this is all about, don't you? It has very little to do with whether you should play "Cora" - it has everything to do with the fact that you've had another fight with Bill.
L28296 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ ... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
L28295 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
L28294 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
L28293 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
L28292 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
L28291 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Margo, you haven't got any age.
L28290 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Don't be evasive.
L28289 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ How do you mean?
L28288 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Don't you think it's about time it became important?
L28287 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Twentyish. It isn't important.
L28286 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ "Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?
L28285 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ The play? All right, I guess...
L28284 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ How's the new one coming?
L28283 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I will.
L28282 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ When you do, let me in on it.
L28281 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
L28280 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
L28279 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Shucks. And my autograph book is at the cleaners.
L28278 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
L28277 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Who's left out there?
L28275 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Up in the room.
L28274 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Where is she?
L28273 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ There you are, both of you. Max, Karen has decided it's time to go.
L28197 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ What is he talking about?
L28196 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ The general atmosphere is very Macbethish. What has or is about to happen?
L28182 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ ... Among so many quiet qualities.
L28181 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness...
L28086 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...
L28085 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ How about calling it a night?
L27749 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I doubt very much that you'd like her in 'The Hairy Ape'.
L27748 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Would you, really? How sweet-
L27695 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Within your time, buster. Lloyd, honey, be a playwright with guts. Write me one about a nice, normal woman who shoots her husband.
L27694 +++$+++ u3605 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ That was way back...
L27693 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Honey chili had a point. You know, I can remember plays about women - even from the South - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers...

L27941 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ That's right, but I don't understand-
L27940 +++$+++ u3609 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ OPERATOR'S VOICE +++$+++ It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?

L27938 +++$+++ u3609 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ OPERATOR'S VOICE +++$+++ We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...
L27937 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Hello..
L28233 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ My dear Horowitz. In the first place, I'm paying you union scale. Second, it's my piano. Third, if everybody doesn't like kind of dying on the vine, they can get off the vine and go home. "Liebestraum."
L28232 +++$+++ u3610 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ PIANIST +++$+++ Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
L28231 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ "Liebestraum."
L28230 +++$+++ u3610 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ PIANIST +++$+++ No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."
L28229 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
L28228 +++$+++ u3610 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ PIANIST +++$+++ But that was the fourth straight time.
L28227 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Play it again.
L28226 +++$+++ u3610 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ PIANIST +++$+++ I just played it.
L28225 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ "Liebestraum."
L28391 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill!
L28390 +++$+++ u3607 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I said I'm a dying man!
L28389 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I didn't hear you.
L28388 +++$+++ u3607 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
L28387 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Answer my question!
L28386 +++$+++ u3607 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Are you breaking the contract?
