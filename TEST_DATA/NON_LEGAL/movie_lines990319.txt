L523468 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
L523467 +++$+++ u7743 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
L523466 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ They probly thought you was crazy.

L523462 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ And if they saw me pitch the way I did today -- they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
L523461 +++$+++ u7743 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
L523661 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ At the way you ask funny questions, Josie Mae!
L523660 +++$+++ u7744 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ JOSIE MAE +++$+++ Mama, what was we laughin' for?
L523498 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Might be...

L523912 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard? He'll tell you all about it.
L523911 +++$+++ u7745 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ MR HOWARD +++$+++ Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
L523910 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Tired.

L523915 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
L523914 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ What did he want?
L523863 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Well, let's get to it, Miss Rebecca,'cause I been waitin' too long a time for your good cookin'!

L523398 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
L523397 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
L523395 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ The boy is hungry, Rebecca.
L523394 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!
L523393 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ I shore could, Miss Rebecca.
L523392 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I bet you could use a hot cup of coffee, Nathan Lee.
L523389 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ And don't wake up Josie Mae and Earl!
L523388 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Night, son!
L523595 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Is that a blessing, Reverend?
L523594 +++$+++ u7749 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ PREACHER +++$+++ It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
L523593 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
L523592 +++$+++ u7749 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ PREACHER +++$+++ I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
L523591 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
L523590 +++$+++ u7749 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ PREACHER +++$+++ No, I ain't got no word yet, Rebecca. I went to the courthouse yesterday to see 'bout it, but they just won't tell me nothin' about what labor camp Nathan was sent to. I'm sorry, Rebecca.
L523515 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!
L523514 +++$+++ u7751 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ SHERIFF YOUNG +++$+++ Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
L523513 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Will they give him a trial?
L523512 +++$+++ u7751 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ SHERIFF YOUNG +++$+++ I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
L523511 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young!
L523510 +++$+++ u7751 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ SHERIFF YOUNG +++$+++ That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
L523509 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
L523508 +++$+++ u7751 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ SHERIFF YOUNG +++$+++ It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime.
L523507 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I don't understand that, Sheriff Young.
L523506 +++$+++ u7751 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ SHERIFF YOUNG +++$+++ I wish I could, Rebecca, but I can't let you.
L523505 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I wanta see Nathan.
L523504 +++$+++ u7751 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ SHERIFF YOUNG +++$+++ Howya do, Rebecca. I sorta been expectin' you this mornin'.
