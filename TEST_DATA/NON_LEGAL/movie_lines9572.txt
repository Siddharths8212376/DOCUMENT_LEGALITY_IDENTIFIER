L61246 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
L61245 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!
L61244 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ What if you lost your keys?
L61243 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
L61242 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ You were ringing the doorbell!
L61241 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ You answered the door!
L61232 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ That's just great!
L61231 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ 4200 rads...  That certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.
L61222 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ We don't....
L61221 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Professor. Well, not exactly, Professor. You see, we don't point it at the sun.
L61219 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ Just a guess. I figured kids would still be drinking Coke in 1982.
L61218 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ How did you know?
L61215 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ Blast it -- no, I suppose you're right.... You do know the proper chemical formula?
L61214 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Well, Professor, are you sure you want me to tell you? You know, changing the course of history and all....
L61213 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ Of course! The power converter! It works! Of course, it works...  What chemicals do we use?
L61212 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ The power converter...
L61211 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ On second thought, there may be some things you'll have to tell me.
L61205 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.
L61204 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ Pardon me?
L61202 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ No! Don't tell me!  I don't want to know the future! My knowledge of future events... your mere presence here... could have devastating effects on the course of history. And altering history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear. My immediate response is to send you back to your own time.
L61201 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
L61200 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ You've convinced me that you must be who you say you are. No living human has ever seen this machine.  But why? Why even in my twilight years would I remotely consider sending someone back in time?
L61196 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Yeah, a shopping mall. You know, a shopping mall?
L61195 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ A mall?
L61194 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Well, there's a mall here now -- I mean, there will be.
L61193 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Oh, yeah.
L61192 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
L61191 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Jeez -- this is where you used to live, huh? You must have been rich!
L61175 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ Uh, Marty Lewis! I almost didn't recognize him -- haven't seen him in years.
L61174 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Marty.
L61173 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ He will be. Simple inebriation, is all. The young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol... something that runs in the family. You see, he's a second cousin of mine on my mother's side. Came quite a distance to visit me, he added. His name's Lewis.
L61171 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ Ssshhhhh!
L61170 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Professor, you time machine works! It works! It sent me back in time! I'm from 1982!
L61169 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ You know me?
L61168 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Professor? Professor Brown?
L61092 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Sure, he agreed quickly.
L61091 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
L61090 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ All I know is you're throwing away an awful lot of money.
L61089 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ Don't you understand? The mere act of sending matter back in time would change the course of events, and changing history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear.
L61088 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ So what? We'd be rich!
L61087 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ Marty, that would alter history.
L61085 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Sure! Listen -- we take the racing results from today's paper...
L61084 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ A gold mine?
L61081 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Professor, can this thing send Shemp back in time?
L61080 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ Of course. Shemp is unaware that anything even happened, other than his stool suddenly falling over. We had to wait two minutes to catch up to him, but for Shemp the trip was instantaneous.
L61079 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Is Shemp all right?
L61078 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ Exactly two minutes difference...  and it's still ticking!
L61073 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ Why?
L61072 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ The plutonium! That's what I came over here for! Professor, where did you get that stuff?
L61068 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ Precisely! 
L61067 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ A time machine! Because of that Coke?!
L61064 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Now hold on a minute, Professor! Hold the phone. Are you trying to tell me that this -- all of this here -- that this is -- it's a -- a --
L61063 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we'll catch up to him.
L61062 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ The future? What are you talking about? Where's Shemp?!
L61061 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ The appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he! You see, Shemp has just become the world's first time traveller. I've sent Shemp into the future -- two minutes into the future to be exact.
L61060 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Then where the hell is he?
L61059 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ No, Marty. Shemp's molecular structure is completely intact!
L61057 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ Get behind the shield! I'm about to release radiation!
L61056 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ But Professor --
L60928 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ ...To be traveled through
L60927 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Catch you later! 
L60925 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Jeez, for a guy with a ton of clocks, you sure don't pay much attention to time.
L60924 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ Oh, right, right... 
L60923 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Pro, the sun's out!
L60922 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ AM or PM?
L60921 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Eight thirty.
L60920 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ Oh -- Marty -- what time did you say it was?
L60919 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
L60918 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?
L60915 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ A 35mm film chain... I'll see what I can do....
L60914 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ That reminds me, if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain, I've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house -- we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater.
L60913 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ The power of a million hydrogen bombs!  ...and we get twenty four measly volts. It's not fair! I've been working on this power converter since 1949, and you'd think in all that time, I could find the right chemicals that would efficiently convert radiation into electric energy! But no! Thirty three years of dedication and research, and all I've got to show for it is a bootleg video operation!
L60911 +++$+++ u3833 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN +++$+++ Shhhhhhhh!
L60910 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty -- I'm outta here!
L61127 +++$+++ u3835 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh!
L61126 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ What happened to Dick Wilson?
L61125 +++$+++ u3835 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ I run this place! 
L61124 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
L61123 +++$+++ u3835 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ Dick? Dick who?
L61122 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Look, maybe I'd better talk to Dick. Is he around?
L61120 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Sure,.
L61119 +++$+++ u3835 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ Sweet and what?  Maybe you'd better pay for this first.
L61114 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ A Tab.
L61113 +++$+++ u3835 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ What? 
L61112 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Uh, yeah... Gimme a Tab.
L61682 +++$+++ u3834 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ What did you do to yours?
L61681 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ What did you do to your hair?
L61680 +++$+++ u3834 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ Hi, Marty!
L61679 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Suzy!
L61032 +++$+++ u3834 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ Is  something going to happen Saturday night?
L61031 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.
L61030 +++$+++ u3834 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
L61029 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ No way!
L61028 +++$+++ u3834 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ Can you imagine your parents in bed together?
L61027 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Yeah... Jesus! I wonder how he ever got up enough nerve to marry my mom.
L61026 +++$+++ u3834 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
L61025 +++$+++ u3829 +++$+++ m253 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ ...He just lets himself get pushed around all the time! People walk all over him and he never fights back, never stands up for himself.
L62285 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ You expect me to believe that?
L62284 +++$+++ u3836 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Yeah.
L62283 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ You promise to stay down there for an hour?
L62270 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ You don't mind?
L62269 +++$+++ u3836 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Okay.
L62268 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
L62265 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ Can't afford to take chances.
L62264 +++$+++ u3836 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ What's going on?
L62263 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
L62261 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
L62260 +++$+++ u3836 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Oh yeah?
L62259 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ He said not to tell.
L62258 +++$+++ u3836 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Gone?... Where?
L62257 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ Well, he's gone.
L62256 +++$+++ u3836 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Hi. where's Cato?
L62231 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ Okay.
L62230 +++$+++ u3837 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ CATO +++$+++ I'll catch up with you.
L62229 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ Okay.
L62228 +++$+++ u3837 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ CATO +++$+++ Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
L62223 +++$+++ u3837 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ CATO +++$+++ No, he showed me one.
L62222 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ That's what he told you, huh?
L62219 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ She plays the clarinet, too.
L62218 +++$+++ u3837 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ CATO +++$+++ Yeah, I guess.
L62214 +++$+++ u3837 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ CATO +++$+++ They come with the house.
L62213 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ Where'd you get them antlers?
L62212 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ Well, I don't notice us hustling trash, either.
L62211 +++$+++ u3837 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ CATO +++$+++ Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
L62210 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ What you been doing?
L62208 +++$+++ u3837 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ CATO +++$+++ Not bad.
L62207 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ How you doing, Cato?
L62023 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ What do you mean?
L62022 +++$+++ u3837 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ CATO +++$+++ Catch!
L62255 +++$+++ u3837 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ CATO +++$+++ He never bit me.
L62254 +++$+++ u3842 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Does he bite?
L62253 +++$+++ u3837 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ CATO +++$+++ Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
L62252 +++$+++ u3842 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ What do you feed him?
L62251 +++$+++ u3837 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ CATO +++$+++ Yeah.
L62250 +++$+++ u3842 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ That your spider in there? In that bottle?
L62225 +++$+++ u3837 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ CATO +++$+++ Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.
L62224 +++$+++ u3842 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ What'd they look like?
L62221 +++$+++ u3837 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ CATO +++$+++ Sometimes. The other day, though, an old boy was plowing in the field over there, found some old Spanish coins.
L62220 +++$+++ u3842 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Don't you ever get bored around here?
L62062 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.
L62061 +++$+++ u3838 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
L62060 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
L62059 +++$+++ u3838 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ You lost that one?
L62058 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ I used to throw trash for the City.
L62057 +++$+++ u3838 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ You ever held another job before?
L62532 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ I know you do. Good luck to you, too.
L62531 +++$+++ u3839 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ DEPUTY +++$+++ I mean it.
L62530 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ Thanks.
L62529 +++$+++ u3839 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ DEPUTY +++$+++ Good luck to you.
L62528 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ Tom...
L62527 +++$+++ u3839 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ DEPUTY +++$+++ Well, Kit...
L62516 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ Sure.
L62515 +++$+++ u3839 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ DEPUTY +++$+++ Holly's over here, Kit, if you want to see her.
L62512 +++$+++ u3839 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ DEPUTY +++$+++ Sure thing. Come on.
L62511 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
L62510 +++$+++ u3839 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ DEPUTY +++$+++ I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.
L62509 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ Hey, listen, Tom, I don't mean to tell you how to run your show here but these cuffs are pinching. What do you say now?
L62481 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
L62480 +++$+++ u3839 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ DEPUTY +++$+++ Then why'd you do it?
L62479 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ They're okay.
L62478 +++$+++ u3839 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ DEPUTY +++$+++ You like people?
L62477 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ Mmmmm.
L62476 +++$+++ u3839 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ DEPUTY +++$+++ Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.
L62471 +++$+++ u3839 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ DEPUTY +++$+++ Nope.
L62470 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ You ever had to open it up like that before?
L62469 +++$+++ u3839 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ DEPUTY +++$+++ Thirty aught six.
L62468 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ Say, what kind of rifle was that you were shooting at me?
L62459 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.
L62458 +++$+++ u3839 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ DEPUTY +++$+++ We did it, Ray.
L62457 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me.
L62456 +++$+++ u3839 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ DEPUTY +++$+++ Oh yeah?
L62153 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ Cause I can't allow it.
L62152 +++$+++ u3840 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Yeah? Why not?
L62151 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ No, you're not either.
L62150 +++$+++ u3840 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ For coming onto my property... With a gun.
L62149 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ What for?
L62147 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me.
L62146 +++$+++ u3840 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ What do you think you're doing? Go on, get out of here.
L62145 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ I've got a gun here, sir. It's always a good idea to have one around.
L62144 +++$+++ u3840 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ What're you doing?
L62143 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ Hi.
L62139 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ She'd get along okay. And if she didn't, well, she could take off, just take off, I wouldn't mind... I'd always tell people I deserved it.
L62138 +++$+++ u3840 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Well, it's not good enough.  Just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit? Guy like you.
L62137 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ Listen. I got a lot of respect for her, sir.  That's about as good a one as I know to tell you.
L62135 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ Yeah.
L62134 +++$+++ u3840 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Is that right?
L62133 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ You know, before I met her, nobody could ask me how I was doing with my girl. Matter of fact, I didn't really have one.
L62131 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ I wasn't aware there was any law against it.
L62130 +++$+++ u3840 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ What'd you come out here for?
L62129 +++$+++ u3843 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ Sure is pretty.
L62281 +++$+++ u3842 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Well, I've felt that way, hadn't you?
L62280 +++$+++ u3841 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ Yeah. I can imagine.
L62279 +++$+++ u3842 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ I've got to stick by Kit... He feels trapped.
L62278 +++$+++ u3841 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ I don't know.
L62277 +++$+++ u3842 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ You love him?
L62276 +++$+++ u3841 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ Jack.
L62275 +++$+++ u3842 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ What's your friend's name?
L62274 +++$+++ u3841 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ Okay.
L62273 +++$+++ u3842 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
L62272 +++$+++ u3841 +++$+++ m254 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ What's going to happen to Jack and me?
