L41340 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Why?
L41339 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Come on up!
L41334 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.
L41333 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ I'm going to stretch my legs
L41318 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ I was all out of dynamite!
L41317 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ By pulling my hair?!
L41316 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ I wasn't bothering you. I was trying to wake you up!
L41315 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
L41314 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
L41248 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me!
L41247 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ You never thought of the possibility?
L41245 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Anastasia's grandmother is in Paris.  We're going to bring Anastasia to her - in Paris. 
L41244 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ I have my reasons.
L41243 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Why do you want to go to Paris?
L41239 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
L41238 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
L41237 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
L41236 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
L41235 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ What happened to your parents?
L41234 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 
L41222 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Who are you?!
L41221 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER.
L41195 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ That's quite a hard head you've got there, boy.
L41194 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
L41193 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Ouch!  That really hurt!
L41605 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ And we have found each other nothing will ever change that! I am your family, dear child, but I may not be your home.
L41604 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ I've spent my whole life waiting to find you ...
L41602 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Yes, you do. You do.
L41601 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
L41600 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
L41599 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ And this is my future. This is who I am!
L41598 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
L41597 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
L41596 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Is it? Is this what you want?
L41595 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ "If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
L41594 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
L41593 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Why does everyone have to act that way?
L41589 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
L41588 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Dmitri didn't want the money?
L41579 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ No, not about the ceremony, Anastasia - do you understand the choice you must make.
L41578 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
L41577 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Don't you, child?
L41533 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ No, no child... shush... it's all right ...
L41532 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
L41531 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Anastasia! It was just a bat! It's gone, dear...
L41525 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Don't worry about that now, child, it will all come back to you now that you're home...
L41524 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ ... and that Christmas dinner, when Cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings! I do remember so much now, Grandmama, - but not everything.
L41519 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
L41518 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
L41514 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ I remember something lost ... I'm so confused! Oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! Do you think I could have... belonged to you ...
L41513 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Do you remember this?
L41512 +++$+++ u3667 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
L41511 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Who are you, child?
L41474 +++$+++ u3672 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ RASPUTIN +++$+++ Shut up!
L41473 +++$+++ u3668 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ BARTOK +++$+++ PARSE HOLDS THE KEY TO MY HEART FRENCH- BAT- CHICKS HANG OUT AT MONTMARTRE WE'LL EAT SOME IN-SECTS THEN GO BACK AND HAVE --
L41431 +++$+++ u3668 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ BARTOK +++$+++ Me? No. Rich food - it kills me. Ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
L41430 +++$+++ u3672 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ RASPUTIN +++$+++ Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris?
L41427 +++$+++ u3672 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ RASPUTIN +++$+++ She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
L41426 +++$+++ u3668 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ BARTOK +++$+++ Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
L41417 +++$+++ u3672 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ RASPUTIN +++$+++ What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
L41416 +++$+++ u3668 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ BARTOK +++$+++ I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
L41415 +++$+++ u3672 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ RASPUTIN +++$+++ Bartok... a question.
L41414 +++$+++ u3668 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ BARTOK +++$+++ I'm getting a chest cold..
L41361 +++$+++ u3668 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ BARTOK +++$+++ Oy... not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you know that.
L41360 +++$+++ u3672 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ RASPUTIN +++$+++ Yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. We must get close to her.
L41288 +++$+++ u3672 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ RASPUTIN +++$+++ Evil, powerful beings - I have their power only if I contain them, control them. If they should all be released at once... well ...
L41287 +++$+++ u3668 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ BARTOK +++$+++ You'd lose your security deposit?
L41286 +++$+++ u3672 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ RASPUTIN +++$+++ Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
L41281 +++$+++ u3668 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ BARTOK +++$+++ My Aunt Bella, sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up, anyway she always said "Curses were made to be broken". Course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound...
L41280 +++$+++ u3672 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ RASPUTIN +++$+++ I cursed then all!
L41279 +++$+++ u3668 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ BARTOK +++$+++ Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
L41276 +++$+++ u3668 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ BARTOK +++$+++ Rodent's intuition, how do I know? She looks exactly like her. Except she's taller, which	is natural ... Of course my second cousin Treplev - he never	grew. Looks like a little pepper shaker. He was so cute ...
L41275 +++$+++ u3672 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ RASPUTIN +++$+++ How do you know?
L41274 +++$+++ u3668 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ BARTOK +++$+++ Trust me, it's her!
L41272 +++$+++ u3668 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ BARTOK +++$+++ Okay... you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like Anastasia is ... still alive.
L41271 +++$+++ u3672 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ RASPUTIN +++$+++ Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
L41270 +++$+++ u3668 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ BARTOK +++$+++ So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague.  Someone's gotta clean that up...
L41268 +++$+++ u3672 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ RASPUTIN +++$+++ Why would I ever be angry with you, little friend?
L41267 +++$+++ u3668 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ BARTOK +++$+++ No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
L41266 +++$+++ u3672 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ RASPUTIN +++$+++ I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
L41264 +++$+++ u3672 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ RASPUTIN +++$+++ And what do you want, my little rat-with-wings?
L41263 +++$+++ u3668 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ BARTOK +++$+++ Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
L41262 +++$+++ u3672 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ RASPUTIN +++$+++ What?
L41565 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!
L41564 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ So where will you go?
L41563 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Watch me.
L41562 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!
L41470 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ Dmitri ... You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. She's a princess and you're a commoner.
L41469 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ What do you mean?
L41468 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
L41466 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ Are you feeling all right?
L41465 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ But it's not	the money, Vlad.
L41464 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich!
L41439 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ It worked in Odessa...
L41438 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ The "Odessa Dunk"?
L41437 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic.
L41436 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ How is our current financial status?
L41377 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ Ah! Let us begin!
L41376 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ See? The Princess is under there ...
L41331 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Pray he's color-blind...
L41330 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ What do we do now?
L41325 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
L41324 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
L41323 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
L41322 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ You're a princess...
L41309 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ What a world - a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant 'Your Highness".
L41308 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ "Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
L41307 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ Wake up, young lady, that's our train.
L41305 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
L41304 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Hurry up with those papers.
L41231 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ Ew. . .  the honest type.
L41230 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .
L41227 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Look!
L41226 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ He's her?
L41225 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ It's her.
L41213 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ That was your dinner!  I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!
L41212 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ What was that?
L41191 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ We will.  We <u>have</u> to.  Come on, Vlad - she's out there.
L41190 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!
L41624 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Run, Anya -  go...
L41623 +++$+++ u3672 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ RASPUTIN +++$+++ I'll show you!
L41572 +++$+++ u3672 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ RASPUTIN +++$+++ STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
L41571 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
L41570 +++$+++ u3672 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ RASPUTIN +++$+++ The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
L41569 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ What do you want?!
L41568 +++$+++ u3672 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ RASPUTIN +++$+++ I know, I know ... you thought I was dead. That's how the history books will remember me - not as the ruler of all of Russia, which I SHOULD HAVE BEEN - but as the guy who was never dead when you expected him to be.
L41567 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Rasputin!
L41566 +++$+++ u3672 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ RASPUTIN +++$+++ So. You don't want to go to the coronation, eh?
L41558 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Oh, Dmitri.I wish that I could.
L41557 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ And tell me that she's happy.
L41556 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ She does.
L41555 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Promise me she'll have her home.
L41554 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
L41553 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ I should go
L41552 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ You are the boy ...
L41550 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Young	man, I...
L41549 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry...
L41548 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ I want you to have the reward money - you've earned it.
L41547 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ No. Empress, you --
L41546 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
L41507 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!
L41506 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...
L41502 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ You! How dare you?! Stop this car immediately!
L41501 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ I'm not Ulo and I won't slow down. But you will listen to me!
L41491 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ Remove him at once.
L41490 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ Please, if you'd just listen...
L41489 +++$+++ u3674 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ TATIANA +++$+++ How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
L41488 +++$+++ u3669 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ DMITRI +++$+++ I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
L41074 +++$+++ u3672 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ RASPUTIN +++$+++ After all I've done for your family - YOU TRIED TO KILL MEEEEEE ! ! !
L41073 +++$+++ u3671 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ I did no such thing!
L41072 +++$+++ u3672 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ RASPUTIN +++$+++ You gave the orders!
L41071 +++$+++ u3671 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ I had nothing to do with it!
L41070 +++$+++ u3672 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ RASPUTIN +++$+++ Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
L41069 +++$+++ u3671 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Rasputin!  You're alive . . .
L41462 +++$+++ u3673 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Oh, heavens, no... but ...  She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect.
L41461 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ Perhaps you could convince her?
L41460 +++$+++ u3673 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
L41459 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
L41458 +++$+++ u3673 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
L41457 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
L41449 +++$+++ u3673 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
L41448 +++$+++ u3675 +++$+++ m242 +++$+++ VLADIMIR +++$+++ May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
L42428 +++$+++ u3676 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ 1ST MAN +++$+++ It's for my brudder.  Alvy Singer! Hey! This is Alvy-

L42425 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You don't want my autograph.
L42424 +++$+++ u3676 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ 1ST MAN +++$+++ Can I have your autograph?
L42419 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I need a large polo mallet!
L42418 +++$+++ u3676 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ 1ST MAN +++$+++ This guy's on television.
