L514351 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
L514350 +++$+++ u7678 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ CYRUS +++$+++ Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
L514349 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Just passing through.
L514348 +++$+++ u7678 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ CYRUS +++$+++ I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?
L514347 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ I'm not going to rob you, mister.  Do I look like a thief?
L514346 +++$+++ u7678 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ CYRUS +++$+++ Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.
L514345 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
L514344 +++$+++ u7678 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ CYRUS +++$+++ Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
L514343 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
L514342 +++$+++ u7678 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ CYRUS +++$+++ You going to sit here all day?
L514515 +++$+++ u7679 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ FELICITY +++$+++ An abortion, stupid.  I had an abortion the day before yesterday. So you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore.  Bye-bye, baby!
L514514 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L514513 +++$+++ u7679 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ FELICITY +++$+++ Yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now. You dig? There's nothing in there now.
L514512 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
L514511 +++$+++ u7679 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ FELICITY +++$+++ Baby? And what baby is that?
L514510 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late.
L514507 +++$+++ u7679 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ FELICITY +++$+++ Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man, don't I? That's more than you can say for yourself, Hawkeye.
L514506 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you.
L514501 +++$+++ u7679 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ FELICITY +++$+++ I don't got no daddy, you dig? I got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.
L514500 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
L514499 +++$+++ u7679 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ FELICITY +++$+++ What do you want me to say?
L514498 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Aren't you going to say anything?
L514497 +++$+++ u7679 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ FELICITY +++$+++ Well what?
L514496 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Well?
L514495 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ It's me, honey. It's Mom.
L514494 +++$+++ u7679 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ FELICITY +++$+++ Yeah? Who is it?
L514834 +++$+++ u7680 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
L514833 +++$+++ u7685 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.
L514088 +++$+++ u7680 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
L514087 +++$+++ u7685 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.
L514051 +++$+++ u7685 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ They didn't have to do a thing, that's all I'm saying. The team was good, the best fucking team in baseball. But then they had to screw it up.  They traded their birthright for a mess of porridge.  A mess of porridge.
L514050 +++$+++ u7680 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
L514049 +++$+++ u7685 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.
L514044 +++$+++ u7685 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Management. Those guys are walking around with their heads up their asses.
L514043 +++$+++ u7680 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Yeah? And why is that?
L514042 +++$+++ u7685 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.
L514063 +++$+++ u7681 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Twelve-eleven.  Twelve-twelve.  Twelve-twelve.
L514062 +++$+++ u7680 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ So what's the time?
L514061 +++$+++ u7681 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Tick-tock, tick-tock.
L514060 +++$+++ u7680 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
L514059 +++$+++ u7681 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Huh?
L514058 +++$+++ u7680 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?
L514826 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Now ask him who his mother was.
L514825 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.
L514818 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .
L514817 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?
L514796 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ It's all right. I really do know them.
L514795 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ We came here to deliver some clean laundry.
L514791 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Research. I worked the scene right into my story.  That makes the medical bills one hundred percent tax deductible.
L514790 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Wow. They sure did a job on you.
L514789 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Hi, kid.
L514689 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Good. I'm glad that's settled!
L514688 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
L514665 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Don't worry about it. You've got friends now, remember? Just behave yourself, and everything will work out.
L514664 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
L514663 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
L514662 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ I'm not going to do it.
L514661 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.
L514660 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
L514659 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.
L514658 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ He was out five thousand bucks, he said.... He kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand bucks down the drain.... He wouldn't stop.... Five thousand bucks, five thousand bucks.... He was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks....
L514657 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No wonder he was angry.
L514656 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ I suppose so. He never told me about it.
L514655 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys?
L514654 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
L514653 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
L514652 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ It wasn't my fault.
L514651 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Well?
L514650 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
L514649 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ So you lost the job. Is that what you're telling me? He just up and fired you?
L514638 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Keep up with that attitude, and you won't have a future.  Seventeen is a hell of an age to die. Is that what you want?
L514637 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ That money is my whole future.
L514636 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
L514635 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
L514634 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
L514633 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ That's it. In a nutshell.
L514632 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
L514631 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
L514630 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you?  So how much does it come to?
L514629 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.
L514628 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Good thinking.
L514627 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ And started to run.
L514626 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ And started to run.
L514625 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Yeah, I picked it up.
L514624 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
L514623 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
L514622 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ So you're saying it wasn't like that at all.
L514621 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Here, catch.
L514620 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Yeah, it might be.
L514619 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Is it yours?
L514618 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ I don't know.
L514617 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You don't believe me, huh?  Look, I'll show you. It's all in this book.
L514616 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
L514615 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
L514614 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ His only copy?
L514613 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes.
L514562 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Absolutely. We would be honored.
L514561 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?
L514555 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
L514554 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
L514545 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
L514544 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.
L514542 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I mean earlier. We could have planned something.
L514541 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ I just did.
L514540 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
L514539 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
L514538 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Celebrate? What for?
L514536 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No, not the end. The beginning.  His son was just a little boy at the time, but the years passed, and when he grew up, he became a skier, too. One day last winter, he went out by himself for a run down the mountain. He gets halfway to the bottom and then stops to eat his lunch next to a big rock. Just as he's unwrapping his cheese sandwich, he looks down and sees a body frozen in the ice -- right there at his feet. He bends down to take a closer look, and suddenly he feels that he's looking into a mirror, that he's looking at himself. There he is -- dead -- and the body is perfectly intact, sealed away in a block of ice -- like someone preserved in suspended animation. He gets down on all fours, looks right into the dead man's face, and realizes that he's looking at his father.
L514535 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ The end.
L514534 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
L514533 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ No way.
L514532 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
L514531 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ The inspiration.
L514530 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
L514529 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Come on, just a little hint.
L514528 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
L514527 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
L514526 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
L514525 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
L514524 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
L514523 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ You work too hard, you know that?
L514522 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
L514521 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ What time did you get to bed last night?
L514520 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Thanks. 
L514519 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
L514518 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Ah, coffee. Smells good.
L514474 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Fair enough. We wouldn't want to get carried away, would we?  Now call your aunt Em and let her know you're alive.
L514473 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Let's not get too idealistic.
L514472 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
L514471 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
L514470 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It looks like they've met in this apartment.
L514469 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ It might not be far, but it's another galaxy. Black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet.
L514468 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live.
L514467 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him.
L514466 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
L514465 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
L514464 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Why don't you go to the police?
L514463 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ I just happened to be walking by... All of a sudden, the Creeper and this other guy come running out of this check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands... They just about ran smack into me. The Creeper recognized me, and I knew he knew I recognized him... If the guy from the check-cashing place hadn't rushed out then screaming bloody murder, he would have shot me. I'm telling you, the Creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk. But the noise distracted him, and when he turned around to see what was happening, I took off... One more second, and I would have been dead.
L514462 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ So that's the something you weren't supposed to see, huh?
L514461 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.
L514460 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ And?
L514459 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.
L514458 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?
L514457 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ You don't really want to know.
L514456 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
L514455 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ I don't have much time. 
L514454 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.
L514453 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
L514452 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Where the hell do you think you're going?
L514451 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
L514450 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Where did you get that thing?
L514449 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ I don't know. For helping me out.
L514448 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Appreciation for what?
L514447 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
L514446 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Hey, it's you.
L514294 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ You too. And make sure the light is green before you cross the street.  Oh, by the way, I liked your book. I think you're a hell of a good writer. 
L514293 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Take good care of yourself, okay?
L514292 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
L514291 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
L514290 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
L514289 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Are you going to be all right?
L514288 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ You don't have to apologize.  The coast is probably clear now anyway.
L514287 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.
L514286 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?
L514285 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?
L514284 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Two or three nights.
L514283 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ And how long did I tell you you could stay?
L514282 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Three nights.
L514281 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ How long have you been here?
L514280 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
L514279 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it?
L514278 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ I'm sorry. I'm really sorry... I was trying to reach for one of the books up there ...  And then, I don't know, the sky fell on top of me.
L514276 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ If you want to steal it, that's your business. At least I won't have you around here making noise.  It might be worth it.
L514275 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?
L514274 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ The world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast.  Look, why not make yourself useful? I'm just about out of smokes.  Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias. 
L514273 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.
L514272 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
L514271 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
L514270 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
L514268 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You'll find juice and eggs and milk in the refrigerator. Cereal in the cupboard. Coffee on the stove. Take whatever you want. But it's time for me to get started in here.
L514267 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Eight-thirty?
L514266 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Eight-thirty.
L514265 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ What time is it?
L514264 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Time to wake up.  Hey, kid, time to wake up.  Rashid!  Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber party is over.
L514263 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
L514262 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
L514261 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Drawing's a good thing.
L514260 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Twelve, thirteen years ago.  Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.
L514259 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ He's dead?
L514258 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.
L514257 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Is your father an artist?
L514256 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
L514255 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Yeah, I can believe it.
L514254 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
L514253 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Nice drawing. Did you do that?
L514252 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
L514251 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.
L514250 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.
L514249 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
L514248 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ That's it. Just the two rooms.
