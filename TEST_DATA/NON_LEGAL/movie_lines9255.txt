L371330 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ In fact I'd rather not try to influence you at all.  Let's just go in and take a look, and then you think it through for yourself.
L371329 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
L371328 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
L371327 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
L371326 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
L371325 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ You think he won't.
L371324 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.
L371323 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Precisely, Maria. Tonight you have the same privilege that comes on rare occasions to the chief executive of some state or nation... the privilege of restoring life, by one tender act of mercy, to a doomed fellow creature.
L371322 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
L371321 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ It happens to be a matter of life and death.
L371320 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ You're asking for somebody else?
L371319 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I didn't mean with me.
L371318 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ Do you think anything between us could be impersonal? Or pure? You better forget logic, because you're proving why I shouldn't go to bed with you.
L371317 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ You should have been a marriage counselor.  But I'll show you what's wrong with your theory.
L371316 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
L371315 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
L371314 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
L371313 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ You're on his side all of the sudden?
L371312 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
L371311 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
L371310 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
L371309 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
L371308 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You're leaving tomorrow?
L371307 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
L371165 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Maria...
L371164 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ Even if I weren't.
L371091 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ But you've made me feel strong again, Captain. Hawkeye.  You helped me pull together when I needed it.
L371090 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
L371089 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
L371088 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Of course not.
L371087 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
L371086 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Ayuh.
L371085 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
L371084 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.
L371083 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
L371082 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Same here.
L371081 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ Very happily married.
L371080 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Something else we have in common.
L371079 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ But I'm married.
L371078 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You have a certain modest charm yourself.
L371077 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ You're an attractive man.
L371076 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
L371075 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ Our minds?
L371074 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
L371073 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
L371072 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ It isn't always this rough?
L371071 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night.
L371070 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ 'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
L371069 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ How did you get called that?
L371068 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
L371067 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long.
L371066 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ There's nothing ridiculous about it.  A kid like you...
L371065 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces.
L371471 +++$+++ u2025 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ KOREAN DOCTOR +++$+++ Who is knowing? But the drug I have find in his urine is solving all mysteries. By tomorrow will be gone his fast heart and high blood pressure. So I think maybe you will like to tell him goodbye. Okay?
L371470 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Why would he do that?
L371469 +++$+++ u2025 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ KOREAN DOCTOR +++$+++ At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.
L371468 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
L371467 +++$+++ u2025 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ KOREAN DOCTOR +++$+++ I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
L371466 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
L371465 +++$+++ u2025 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ KOREAN DOCTOR +++$+++ You please excuse...  I have been making examination of this young man to find if he will be soldier in our army.
L371463 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Yeah!
L371462 +++$+++ u2027 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT SCORCH +++$+++ You really say the cutest things.
L371461 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I didn't have much choice.
L371460 +++$+++ u2027 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT SCORCH +++$+++ It was really nice of you to take me along.
L371060 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Duke...
L371059 +++$+++ u2027 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT SCORCH +++$+++ Second pint.
L371058 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
L371913 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Glad to help.
L371912 +++$+++ u2032 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT +++$+++ Thanks.
L371911 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ They missed the boat.
L371910 +++$+++ u2032 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT +++$+++ Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
L371909 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Be the longest short-arm inspection you ever held!
L371905 +++$+++ u2032 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT +++$+++ They're supposed to hold short-arm inspection.
L371904 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ What do you want with those two medical officers?
L371903 +++$+++ u2032 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT +++$+++ Yes, Reverend?
L371902 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Excuse me, Sergeant.
L371901 +++$+++ u2032 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT +++$+++ Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!
L371594 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Let's get his clothes off quick.
L371593 +++$+++ u2028 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ ME LAY +++$+++ He's coming to.
L371581 +++$+++ u2028 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ ME LAY +++$+++ Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
L371580 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ What's wrong with him?
L371579 +++$+++ u2028 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ ME LAY +++$+++ Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
L371578 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ What's the story?
L371577 +++$+++ u2028 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ ME LAY +++$+++ I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.
L371576 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Why can't you look at him?
L371538 +++$+++ u2028 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ ME LAY +++$+++ That's about the only thing I don't do – that I'm built for. I inspect the girls and take care of some of the kids in the hospital. Sometimes I tend bar and act as bouncer.
L371537 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ What do you do in the joint besides pimp?
L371536 +++$+++ u2028 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ ME LAY +++$+++ I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.
L371535 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You don't go after the local scrunch?
L371532 +++$+++ u2028 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ ME LAY +++$+++ Proud to know you, Trapper. Like to shake your hand if you'll hurry up and get that chest closed.  You still working the trains?
L371531 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ The one and only.
L371530 +++$+++ u2028 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ ME LAY +++$+++ The real Trapper John? The one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the Boston and Maine Railroad?
L371526 +++$+++ u2028 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ ME LAY +++$+++ Save that crap for the rest of the clamdiggers back home.
L371525 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ He's the pro from Dover and I'm the Ghost of Smokey Joe.
L371334 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
L371333 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Morning Painless. How they goin'?
L371302 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ I wonder, if Red's fix swings it for me, what's heaven really like?
L371301 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
L371300 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ How much time do I have?
L371267 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ You guys got any black capsules?
L371266 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ In the direction you want to go.
L371261 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Well, I'm sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces.
L371260 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ That's really what I came here for. See what you guys recommend.
L371246 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ No, one thing I finally know for sure, I'll never function with a woman again.
L371245 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
L371244 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
L371243 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
L371242 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
L371241 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Just in dreams?
L371240 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ No, never in the slightest.
L371239 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
L371238 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ Now I know that's been my problem since I was a kid. But it only caught up to me last night.
L371237 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ Homosexuality.
L371236 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?
L371235 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ Don Juanism is just a cover... I've been reading up on it.  I'm a fake, I'm a fraud, I've been living a lie!
L371234 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
L371233 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ But I had this feeling I ought to make the effort. To test myself. And I flunked.
L371232 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ You noticed. I wasn't going to fool around over here. I've got these three girls I'm engaged to back home...
L371231 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ There's only one worth noticing.
L371230 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.
L371229 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Tell me the whole story, Walt.
L371228 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
L371033 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Poker sounds great. When do you play?
L371032 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you.
L371861 +++$+++ u2023 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HO-JON +++$+++ I – wouldn't – wish – it – on – a – maneating – shark.
L371860 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
L371410 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I don't think so either.
L371409 +++$+++ u2023 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HO-JON +++$+++ And if I go to New York, the natives there will carry me? I don't think so.
L371248 +++$+++ u2023 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HO-JON +++$+++ He's comin' this-a-way! The jaw- breaker!
L371247 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ There ought to be a law against dentists reading. Matter of fact, I thought there was. Anyway, this is an obsession. He can't be persuaded out of it.
L371171 +++$+++ u2023 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HO-JON +++$+++ Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.
L371170 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?
L371116 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
L371115 +++$+++ u2023 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HO-JON +++$+++ Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.
L371099 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ That. It's out of the act.
L371098 +++$+++ u2023 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HO-JON +++$+++ I have not understood what you means.
L371097 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You can cut the bow.
L371096 +++$+++ u2023 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HO-JON +++$+++ Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.
L371792 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
L371791 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
L371646 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You got to relax, Henry. Since the deluge started, you been working in the OR and running the outfit, too.
L371645 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers. How long can a battle go on?
L371371 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Now I'll have to wait at least a week. If I announced it tomorrow, after what our new Chief Nurse saw this afternoon, they'd hear her yelling from Seoul to Washington.
L371370 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ First decent idea you've had in a month.
L371366 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Christ. All of a sudden it's West Point.
L371365 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I should fire him because he got in the way of Trapper's fist? No. I've put up with a lot from you guys, but now I finally have to take disciplinary action.
L371362 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
L371361 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.
L371162 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ We don't want any more than that.  Right now.
L371161 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
L371160 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ About that chest-cutter...
L371159 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Major Burns will be out of your tent in twenty-four hours.  Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest are on their way.
L371158 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven.
L371144 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ That's all the commitment you're offering me?  Or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation?
L371143 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ We'll find out what they are when you throw us out.
L371140 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Your tent?
L371139 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
L371138 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ You don't aim to cause any trouble – But?
L371025 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.
L371024 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
L371023 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
L371022 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ The blonde dish.
L371009 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Nope, we're assigned heah.
L371008 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
L371851 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.
L371850 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch.
L371360 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ I don't know. I must have lost my punch. I didn't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up.
L371359 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What's wrong with you?
L371357 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization.
L371356 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ If you say so, Henry. But remember my claustrophobia.
L371353 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ I did. First and only blow. So far.

L371350 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What's going on? Who started this?
L371611 +++$+++ u2031 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ RADAR +++$+++ And another one, but it's from the south.  There.
L371610 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Damn.
L371609 +++$+++ u2031 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ RADAR +++$+++ Chopper coming in, Colonel. Two of them, I'm afraid.

L371039 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
L371038 +++$+++ u2031 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ RADAR +++$+++ Sir?
L371037 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
L371036 +++$+++ u2031 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ RADAR +++$+++ Sir?
L370978 +++$+++ u2031 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ RADAR +++$+++ Yes, sir, I'll see if I can reach General Hammond in Seoul for you. You think he'll finally break down and give us two more surgeons?
L370977 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
L370976 +++$+++ u2031 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ RADAR +++$+++ I'm afraid so, Colonel.
