L452402 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!
L452401 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ You bet your boots, Leo.  It's Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise. Upward and onward.  Say, you'll join me.  Nothing can stop us.
L452399 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!
L452398 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life.
L452388 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Yes.  That's it.  Happy.  Well, whatta ya think of that.  Happy.
L452387 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Maybe you're happy.
L452386 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
L452385 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Everybody's a big shot.  Well, Leo, are you having a good time?
L452383 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Two pistachios, my good man.
L452382 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
L452381 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ What kind now, Leo?
L452377 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Then stick with Bialystock!
L452376 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Right.
L452375 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
L452374 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
L452373 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
L452372 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Coney Island??
L452371 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day.  Why waste it indoors.  I've got it!  Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.
L452370 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
L452369 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Where would you like to eat?
L452368 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Oh.
L452367 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ I already have.  Come on.
L452366 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Okay ... Max!  And you can call me Leo.
L452365 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.
L452364 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ I got it, Mr. Bialystock.
L452347 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ That's very kind of you, Mr. Bialystock, but I ...
L452346 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
L452345 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
L452344 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
L452343 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.
L452342 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ How's this? 
L452341 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ It's a little better, but you still look angry.
L452340 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?
L452339 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
L452338 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
L452332 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ I'm hysterical.  I'm having hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I can't stop.  When I get like this, I can't stop.  I'm hysterical.
L452331 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
L452330 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
L452329 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Will you get a hold on yourself.
L452328 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Aaaaaaaaaa!
L452327 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ I'm not going to jump on you!
L452326 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me.
L452325 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ What???
L452324 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
L452323 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ You're going to jump on me.
L452322 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
L452321 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
L452318 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Mr. Bialystock, not more than five minutes ago, against my better judgment, I doctored your books. That, sir, is the ultimate extent of my criminal life.
L452317 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
L452316 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Mr. Bialystock.  No.  Wait.  Please. You're holding me too tight.  I'm an honest man.  You don't understand.
L452311 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!
L452310 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought.
L452309 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
L452308 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ What scheme?
L452307 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
L452306 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
L452305 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ But what if the play was a hit?
L452304 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ See?  You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
L452303 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ One night.
L452302 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Exactly.  And how long did it run?
L452301 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
L452300 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
L452299 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
L452298 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
L452297 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ What did I do?
L452296 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
L452295 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ What do you mean?
L452294 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
L452293 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Assume away!
L452290 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how.  How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?
L452289 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Yes, it's quite possible.
L452288 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
L452287 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ What was I saying?
L452286 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ What you were saying.  Keep talking.
L452285 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Yes, what?
L452278 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
L452277 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
L452276 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much.  I'm sure I can hide it somewhere.  After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.
L452275 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
L452274 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Oh, it's all right ... wha?
L452273 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
L452272 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
L452271 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Help!
L452268 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!
L452267 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ But that's cheating!
L452266 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
L452265 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
L452264 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?
L452263 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
L452262 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Where?  What?
L452261 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
L452260 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do for you?
L452259 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Mr. Bialystock ...
L452258 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
L452257 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
L452256 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Here, don't panic.
L452251 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ It's nothing ... nothing.
L452250 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ What is that?  A handkerchief?
L452246 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry, you're using up your time.
L452245 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
L452244 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
L452243 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Well, sir, it seems ...
L452242 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
L452241 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
L452240 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Good, what is it?
L452239 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ I have hurt your feelings.
L452238 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention.  Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people?
L452237 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
L452236 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
L452233 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there.
L452232 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Yes, sir.  Thank you.
L452231 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Do the books!  Do the books!
L452230 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ...
L452224 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation.  How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
L452223 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ But sir, I'm not condem ...
L452217 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Then account for yourself!  Do you believe in God?  Do you believe in gold?  Why are you looking up old lady's dresses?  Bit of a pervert, eh?
L452216 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Yes sir.
L452212 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant, I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was sent here to do your books and I'm terribly sorry I caught you with the old lady. 
L452211 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ All right.  Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are.
L452210 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Scared.  Can't talk.
L452209 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?
L452208 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?
L452156 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ Ooooooops.
L452155 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Oooooooops!
L452154 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ I'll wait in the hall ...
L452153 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.
L452152 +++$+++ u7160 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BLOOM +++$+++ How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
L452151 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.
L453089 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Of course I need you.  It's dark in there.
L453088 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Do you need us?
L453083 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.
L453082 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Do it!  Do it!
L453072 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ All right.  Finish the job.  Let's get outta here.
L453071 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not franks!
L453068 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Yes.  Amazing isn't it?
L453067 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
L453066 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Here.  You see.  This is the slow fuse.  It is much wider.  It has more resistance, more density. Therefore, it burns slower.
L453049 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Qviet.  Qviet  This is very important.
L453048 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Come on.  Let's get going.
L453047 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...
L453042 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.
L453041 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.
L453005 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ It's that LSD und his verdampter babies!...
L453004 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
L453003 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Always.
L453002 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
L453001 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...
L452998 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.
L452997 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.
L452990 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
L452989 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Not.
L452768 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ All right, but remember, if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you.
L452767 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't let you down.
L452764 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ I don't know.  I don't know.
L452763 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
L452762 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ But he has long hair!
L452761 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.
L452760 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Vaaaat???
L452735 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.
L452734 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...
L452493 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Good.  I will make the preparations.
L452492 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Yes.  We would!
L452491 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?

L452485 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. 
L452484 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
L452483 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ Really, I never dreamed ...
L452482 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
L452481 +++$+++ u7158 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ BIALYSTOCK +++$+++ No kidding?
L452480 +++$+++ u7165 +++$+++ m481 +++$+++ LIEBKIND +++$+++ Vit the Fuhrer, of course.  He liked me.  Out of all the household staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his favorite.  I vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime.
