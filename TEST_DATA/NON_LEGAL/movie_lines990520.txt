L658948 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
L658947 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Because – somehow – they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
L658946 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ But why would they murder...
L658945 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.

L658938 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
L658937 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Oh? Anything else?
L658936 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ She thinks you should get married and have children of your own. Instead of trying to be a father to hers. Except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility.
L658935 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ No.
L658934 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Your sister said you don't have a family?

L658931 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ But not a good tired.
L658929 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I would not be too sure.
L658928 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ They kid a lot.
L658927 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ No you're not –  You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
L658926 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Look, I'm genuinely sorry...

L658924 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ We do not go into your courts.

L658922 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
L658921 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Whacking?
L658920 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
L658919 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Now what's the problem?
L658862 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
L658861 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ What was that?
L658859 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ It's not a joke.
L658858 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
L658857 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
L658856 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
L658855 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You have no right to keep us here.
L658854 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
L658853 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Where are you taking us?
L658809 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ There'll be another train.  The man who was killed tonight was a policeman, Sam. It's my job to find out who did it. I want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there.
L658808 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
L658807 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?

L659141 +++$+++ u8939 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.

L658977 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
L658976 +++$+++ u8939 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What the hell are you talking about? What's happening.
L658975 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight.

L658816 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he looked like?
L658815 +++$+++ u8939 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I didn't even know about it.

L659223 +++$+++ u8939 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What I know, Paul, is...  He's going to take you out...
L659222 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton.  Tell me what you know...

L659218 +++$+++ u8939 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I admit I don't know where he is.
L659217 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ You admit you're lying?
L659216 +++$+++ u8939 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Probably.
L659215 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ You'd lie to protect him.
L659214 +++$+++ u8939 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Wrong.
L659213 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ You know where he is.
L659077 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ But... if you had to guess?
L659076 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I don't know where he is.
L659075 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him –
L659074 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
L659073 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
L659072 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know – anybody who knows John – knows that's a goddamn lie!
L659071 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.
L659069 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ Not yet.
L659068 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Did you find him?
L658917 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Listen, I don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him, but don't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around, okay?
L658916 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
L658915 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ No? Why not?
L658914 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
L658913 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ God, Fred...
L658912 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
L658911 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What's so funny?
L658900 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
L658899 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
L658898 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee.
L658897 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John.
L658896 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
L658895 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You didn't have to...
L658894 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Good morning.

L659212 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You shame yourself.
L659211 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
L659210 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I will be the judge of that.
L659209 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ You are acting like one!
L659208 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I am not a child.
L659207 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ Do not make light of it, Rachel. They can do it... quick! Like that! And then... then I can not sit at table with you. I can not take a thing from your hand. I... I can not go with you to meeting!  Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far! Dear child!
L659206 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ That is idle talk.
L659205 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
L659204 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I have committed no sin.
L659203 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
L659202 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I have done nothing against the ordnung.
L659201 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
L659188 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter.
L659187 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman.
L659026 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I know God help me, I know that, Eli.  But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel.
L659025 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
L659024 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
L659023 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws –
L659015 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I know.
L659014 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ That has no place in this house.

L659283 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
L659282 +++$+++ u8943 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ LOCAL MAN +++$+++ We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
