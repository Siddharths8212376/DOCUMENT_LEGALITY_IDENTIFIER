L296758 +++$+++ u5988 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Right o'.
L296757 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Got a meeting uptown.
L296756 +++$+++ u5988 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?
L296755 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.
L296754 +++$+++ u5988 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?
L296753 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?
L296752 +++$+++ u5988 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about?
L297392 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Paul? Yeah. You think --
L297391 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --
L297389 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Ben, I don't think he wants us here.
L297388 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Yeah. Well, we can just --
L297387 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ The phone's out.
L297386 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Do you think? Maybe we should call someone --
L297319 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ We'll talk in the morning.
L297318 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
L297317 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
L297315 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Ben.
L297314 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I'll drive you --
L297313 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?
L297312 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Elena.
L297262 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ We're not going anywhere.
L297261 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Ready to go?
L297145 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben. Thank you. So let's just go to this fiasco if that's what you want to do. Let's just go on in. I'd rather talk to anyone else but you.
L297144 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
L297143 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
L297142 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Elena, it's not what you think. It's not a big plot. Honestly. Honestly. I don't know if you want to go over this now, but it's just something that comes over me. I don't feel good about it. I know I've done what I didn't want to do. I don't know --
L297141 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Elena.
L297140 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch --
L297139 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I'm not.
L297138 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ You're not going to --
L297137 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --
L297136 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Damn it, Ben --
L297135 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.
L297134 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Well?
L297133 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
L297132 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ That this was going to be a key party?
L297131 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I know, I know. I had no idea --
L297130 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ This just isn't the best moment for this.
L297129 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll be right back, Dot.
L297128 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ In the car.
L297127 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You've...
L297115 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Benjamin. That's supposed to explain it?
L297114 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
L297113 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.
L297111 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here.
L297110 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ If you're going to insult me --
L297109 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
L297108 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ It's a starting place.
L297107 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
L297106 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
L297105 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --
L297104 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ I'm not surprised.
L297103 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Elena, what are you're talking about?
L297102 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Don't be dim.
L297101 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ What do you mean?
L297100 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
L297099 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ What's on your mind? Don't --
L297098 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ I have no idea.
L297097 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You think I --
L297096 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Don't start.
L297095 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ No advice from the experts, huh?
L297094 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ See for yourself.
L297093 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ What's for dessert?
L297082 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ That one.
L297081 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Yeah, that one.
L297080 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
L297079 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
L297078 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
L297077 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
L297076 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
L297075 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ In the basement over at Janey and Jim's. With that weirdo Mikey. Not even a TV on. And they're on the floor and he's got his trousers down though thank goodness she's still dressed. Well, I really let him have it!  ... and Wendy came home peacefully... Hey, should I dress for the Halford's now, or - give me your -
L297073 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You go dry off now.
L297072 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Dinner in ten minutes.
L297018 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Stuffed and baking.
L297017 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ The turkey in?
L296974 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
L296973 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ What?
L296972 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ That shirt?
L296971 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday.
L296969 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Hell, I know. I -- I guess if you want to accuse me, you've got --  Oh hell! I've got to pick up Paul. I almost forgot.
L296968 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
L296967 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?
L296966 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
L296965 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --
L296964 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know...
L296963 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You crying?
L296962 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Ben, maybe no talking right now? If you start talking, you're going to--
L296961 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You know Elena, I've been thinking--
L296960 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ I... I think I am...
L296959 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I do. I'm -- are you...?
L296958 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
L296957 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Um, yes.
L296956 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
L296955 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You all right there?
L296852 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Hmm. Good night.
L296851 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?
L296849 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Rough day. Good night.
L296848 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ So early?
L296847 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I'm, uh, going to bed.
L296846 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.
L296845 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ What do you think?
L296844 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You want to go?
L296843 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ The Halfords have invited us again this year.
L296747 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Good night.
L296746 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Good night.
L296744 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Elena.
L296743 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ -- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
L296742 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --
L296741 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
L296740 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.
L296739 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ So maybe you'll come too?
L296738 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Then again, why should she be? I mean with us, with our...
L296737 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Why shouldn't she be?
L296736 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
L296735 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
L296734 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
L296733 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I wasn't star--
L296732 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ You're staring at me.
L296699 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ And as usual no one believed me...
L296698 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit --
L296674 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Gotcha.
L296673 +++$+++ u5986 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ No thank you. We should be off.
L296672 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ OK, OK, the defense rests.  Want another?
L297090 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Libbets? What kind of name is Libbets?
L297089 +++$+++ u5996 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Libbets. Libbets Casey.
L297088 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Ah let the guy have his fun. What's the name of this girl with the Park Avenue address?
L297084 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Stay out of trouble.
L297083 +++$+++ u5996 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ See you.
L297002 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Thanks.
L297001 +++$+++ u5996 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Sure dad.
L297000 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Um, Paul. On second thought, can you do me a favor and pretend I never said any of that.
L296999 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ All the more reason for this little heart to heart... great.
L296998 +++$+++ u5996 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Uh, dad, you know I'm 16.
L296997 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Holy! Well. If you're worried about anything, just feel free to ask, and, uh, we can look it up.
L296995 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Well, the whole gamut. Facts of life and all. Some fatherly advice, because, I tell you, there's things happening that you're probably old enough... well...  For example, on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case -- and, um, not onto the linen, and not on your sister's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother --
L296994 +++$+++ u5996 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ About?
L296993 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You know Paul, I've been thinking, maybe this is as good a time as any to have a little talk, you know, about -- well --
L296992 +++$+++ u5996 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yeah.
L296991 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
L296990 +++$+++ u5996 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Hnnn.
L296989 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Anyone special? You know...
L296988 +++$+++ u5996 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Fine.
L296987 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Grades?
L296986 +++$+++ u5996 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Good.
L296985 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Classes?
L296984 +++$+++ u5996 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ All right.
L296983 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ So how's school treating you?
L296661 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Lab experiments? Right smart guy -- Paul, you know your mother's gonna be disappointed not to see more of you -- In fact, let me make this more than a simple request guy, I think you should...
L296660 +++$+++ u5996 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Well dad, actually I thought I'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments --
L296659 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.
L296658 +++$+++ u5996 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'm fine dad.
L296657 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
L296656 +++$+++ u5996 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Hi dad.
L297166 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I just can't believe you could be so --
L297165 +++$+++ u5991 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --
L297164 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --
L297163 +++$+++ u5991 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.
L297162 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ What?
L297161 +++$+++ u5991 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ A prior engagement overcame me.
L297160 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Don't bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ, I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened?
L297159 +++$+++ u5991 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L297158 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Damn right, but where the hell were you?
L297157 +++$+++ u5991 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.
L297037 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Right. Gotcha.
L297036 +++$+++ u5991 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ Birth control.
L297035 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Huh?
L297033 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Yeah, but, I -- I've been working a lot lately, and -- No, that's not it. I guess we've just been on the verge of saying something, whatever it is, just saying something to each other. On the verge.
L297032 +++$+++ u5991 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
L297031 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Maybe it's all for the better, you know? Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything?
L297029 +++$+++ u5991 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ In a bit.
L297028 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
L297027 +++$+++ u5991 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ Here.
L296819 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Gotcha.
L296818 +++$+++ u5991 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.
L296817 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right.
L296816 +++$+++ u5991 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.
L296815 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Yeah?
L296814 +++$+++ u5991 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ Ben--
L296813 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ It's like farming. I am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks, and George Clair has obviously, in the mere two years since he joined the firm, he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro, and I assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course. And the guy talks - incessantly -- throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department --
L297394 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ C'mon.
L297393 +++$+++ u5999 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ He's probably been waiting all night at the station.
L297070 +++$+++ u5999 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Yeah.
L297069 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Your toes cold?
L297068 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I mean, he's not serious, he'll end up living off Janey and Jim, you watch. It's just that you develop a sense when you get older, if things are going to work out or if they won't, and sometimes it's not worth the mess...
L297067 +++$+++ u5999 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Huh?
L297066 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Look, kiddo, don't worry about it. I really don't care that much. I'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all.
L297065 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home.
L297064 +++$+++ u5999 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
L297063 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
L297062 +++$+++ u5999 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Talking to me, dad?
L297059 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ What do I think? I think you're probably touching each other. I think you're touching that reckless jerk-off, for god's sake, and I think he's trying to get into your slacks. I think, at fourteen years of age, that you're getting ready to give up your girlhood --
L297058 +++$+++ u5999 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ What do you think we're doing, dad?
L297057 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ What the hell are you kids doing down here?
L297026 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Jesus all right enough!
L297025 +++$+++ u5999 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ ... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and --
L296982 +++$+++ u5999 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Nothing.
L296981 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ What you been up to?
L296980 +++$+++ u5999 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Nah.
L296979 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come?
L296731 +++$+++ u5984 +++$+++ m397 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Good night kiddo.
