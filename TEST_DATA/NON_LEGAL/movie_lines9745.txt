L160434 +++$+++ u4812 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ Bullshit! That's bullshit!
L161012 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Like I say, Phantom Mary's pretty weird... Lives alone, lives way out in the middle of nowhere with a cat called Pajamas and a cow called Fred. Well, last week I got a call from Phantom Mary, which in itself was very strange...
L161011 +++$+++ u4809 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Yeah!
L161010 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?
L161009 +++$+++ u4809 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ No.
L161008 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Didn't I ever tell you about Phantom Mary?
L161007 +++$+++ u4809 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Phantom Mary?
L161006 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
L161005 +++$+++ u4809 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
L161004 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in.  We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip?
L161003 +++$+++ u4809 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?
L161002 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Yeah.
L161001 +++$+++ u4809 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Merle gave me this?
L161000 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind.
L160999 +++$+++ u4809 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Merle? ... Merle's alive?  How do you know?
L160998 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ It's Merle, Sal.
L160995 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ It's not socks, Sal.
L160994 +++$+++ u4809 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Maybe you could use socks, Nick. Jesus, I mean, come to think of it socks are pretty expensive now.
L160989 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Here. Behind you.
L160988 +++$+++ u4809 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Where?
L160987 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?
L160986 +++$+++ u4809 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ You didn't get a deer?
L160985 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ No.
L160984 +++$+++ u4809 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Did you get one?
L160983 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Yeah.
L160982 +++$+++ u4809 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Did you go hunting.
L160981 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I know. It's like coming from the moon. Or Mars.
L160980 +++$+++ u4809 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
L160979 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are gonna do it!
L160978 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ We do, Sal. We do... You're the heart.
L160977 +++$+++ u4809 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
L160976 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Sal, we need you. We need you.
L160955 +++$+++ u4809 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ I gotta get back, Nick.
L160954 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John Wayne's making so much noise I can hardly --
L160953 +++$+++ u4809 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean --
L160952 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What?
L160951 +++$+++ u4809 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ I'm gonna stay here, Nick.
L160950 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ John Wayne's great... Listen, Sal. Jesus. When are you getting out?
L160949 +++$+++ u4809 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Listen, Nick --
L160948 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Great. Hey. That's great.

L160946 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What's that noise?
L160945 +++$+++ u4809 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ What?
L160944 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What's that noise?
L160943 +++$+++ u4809 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
L160942 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Oh. You know. How's it with you?
L160941 +++$+++ u4809 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Nick. Hey. How's things?
L160940 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.
L160447 +++$+++ u4809 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ See you Monday.
L160446 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ See you Monday.
L160445 +++$+++ u4809 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ That's my plan.
L160444 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Great. That's great.
L160443 +++$+++ u4809 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
L160442 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
L160441 +++$+++ u4809 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Right.
L160440 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Don't worry what it says in the book.
L160287 +++$+++ u4809 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ You guys are crazy. You know that? I mean you guys are really nuts.
L160286 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
L160285 +++$+++ u4809 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight?
L160273 +++$+++ u4809 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ There's Albert!  Hey, Albert!!!
L160272 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Where's Vince?
L161102 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I just... would like to say a few words... about Merle. I guess Merle always wanted something... I don't know... better. That fucking guy, he saved my Life. He saved Sal's... What Merle liked, he liked things right... But then there wasn't any place for that... that he could find.
L161101 +++$+++ u4812 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ Quiet!... Quiet!!!... Awright, everybody, Nick has a few words.
L160936 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!

L160934 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
L160933 +++$+++ u4812 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ What the hell was that!  What did you think? Did you think it was loaded!
L160878 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ In the timeless words of Squire Albert...
L160877 +++$+++ u4812 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ Just like always! Just like it always was! Right, Nick? Am I right?
L160863 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Sure.

L160860 +++$+++ u4812 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ You're full of shit!
L160859 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ They have these little sticks, Vince. They call them "chomp chomps", and when you get these girls going, you have to stick 'em in their mouths.
L160858 +++$+++ u4812 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ Six or eight.  And they go wild?
L160857 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun.
L160856 +++$+++ u4812 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
L160855 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Never one.

L160852 +++$+++ u4812 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
L160851 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Naw.  Uh-huh.
L160850 +++$+++ u4812 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean --
L160849 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A!
L160848 +++$+++ u4812 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ How's it feel, huh? How's it feel to be back?
L160786 +++$+++ u4812 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ What's it for??
L160785 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What the hell's that for?
L160783 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Cynthia! Hey, that's terrific. I mean... Great! That's really great!
L160782 +++$+++ u4812 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ That's who.
L160781 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Cynthia! Sure.
L160778 +++$+++ u4812 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ Aw, it's a long story!
L160777 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Well, who'd you get married to?
L160772 +++$+++ u4812 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ Same old thing. Hey, same like always. Nothing's changed. Albert is getting fat.
L160771 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ How're you guys... I mean, how've you guys been?
L160289 +++$+++ u4808 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ It's all right. Hey, it's all right. We'll be right here, right with you.
L160288 +++$+++ u4812 +++$+++ m320 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ He's getting married... and we're nuts!

L161698 +++$+++ u4813 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ BENNETT +++$+++ Wade did a little reminiscing.
L161697 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Talk fast.  Polls open in half an hour.
L161292 +++$+++ u4813 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ BENNETT +++$+++ Wade's here.
L161291 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Yeah?
L161220 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ I want this bastard brought down.
L161219 +++$+++ u4813 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ BENNETT +++$+++ Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
L161218 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
L161217 +++$+++ u4813 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ BENNETT +++$+++ Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
L161216 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ That's him.  Simon Doucet.
L161206 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ I can smell it.
L161205 +++$+++ u4813 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ BENNETT +++$+++ No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
L161204 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Technothugs?
L161203 +++$+++ u4813 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ BENNETT +++$+++ Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
L161202 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ What'cha got, Bennett?
L161201 +++$+++ u4813 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ BENNETT +++$+++ Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.
L161695 +++$+++ u4817 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Mom, I hate to break this to you, but there's a whole other species out there you're neglecting.  If you've forgotten, they're called 'men'.  Sometimes referred to in more colorful language.
L161694 +++$+++ u4814 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ CASSY +++$+++ Kimberly!
L161693 +++$+++ u4817 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ I think he wants more than your cookies.
L161692 +++$+++ u4814 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ CASSY +++$+++ He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
L161691 +++$+++ u4817 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
L161690 +++$+++ u4817 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ I'd think about it.
L161689 +++$+++ u4814 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ CASSY +++$+++ What did you say?
L161688 +++$+++ u4817 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Michael called yesterday.  He wants to take Willy for the summer.
L161892 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Put that on your political resume.
L161891 +++$+++ u4815 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ DUBBS +++$+++ It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
L161856 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Prepare for a change in lifestyle.
L161855 +++$+++ u4815 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ DUBBS +++$+++ I worked for him... still do.  Said he'd make sure I was left alone if I helped put Wade away.  He kept his promise for twenty years.
L161854 +++$+++ u4815 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ DUBBS +++$+++ It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
L161853 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Speak up.
L161846 +++$+++ u4815 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ DUBBS +++$+++ Your mother.
L161845 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
L161844 +++$+++ u4815 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ DUBBS +++$+++ Fuck you - fuck you.
L161843 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Funny guy.
L161842 +++$+++ u4815 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ DUBBS +++$+++ No, you're not model material.  Anything else?
L161841 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ I want to ask you a few questions.
L161840 +++$+++ u4815 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ DUBBS +++$+++ Who are you?  What the fuck do you want?
L161839 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ My man Dubbs.
L161838 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Avon Lady!
L161837 +++$+++ u4815 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ DUBBS +++$+++ Who is it?
L161888 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You stole the heroin out of the evidence room and planted it on me.  I was iced.  What better way to keep me from talking.  Stop me if I'm wrong.
L161887 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ I don't want to hear anymore.
L161886 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ <u>You</u> were the dirty cop... and I was on to you.  You panicked.  Afraid I was going to expose you... so you shut me up.
L161885 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ You're crazy.
L161884 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You were planning to send me back to the ice house.  You set me up.
L161883 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L161882 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ That wasn't your plan, was it?
L161881 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
L161880 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ We have to talk.
L161879 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ What is it?  I'm about to go on.
L161774 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Not anymore.
L161773 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
L161772 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I'm wasting time.
L161768 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Where?
L161767 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Just got the call.  Took him from school.  Bastard nailed the Vice- Principal and a teacher.
L161598 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?
L161597 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
L161596 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Remember my promise.
L161595 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ This is a war, Wade.  You against him.  Vengeance time.  The City's just in the way.  Kill the fucker. You and me.  We'll work things out when the time is right.
L161591 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ And I want Doucet.
L161590 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I want to stop aging.
L161589 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Ah, fuck you, Wade.  This is bull- shit.  You're not going to kill me.  You're not going to risk your freedom.
L161588 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I'm not voting for you.
L161587 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ You can't kill me.  I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.
L161585 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ I'll be alright.
L161584 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Tell Frick and Frack that means them too.
L161583 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Out of the room.
L161582 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Hello Wade.
L161326 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I've been alone for twenty years. I don't feel very sociable.
L161325 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ You're working a partner on this.
L161324 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I'm going to kill you when this is all over.
L161323 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ The faster you get Doucet, the younger you'll be.
L161318 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ When you bring in Doucet.
L161317 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Give it to me.
L161316 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
L161315 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
L161314 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ No, but he's going to be by tomorrow. He's aging.  'Bout the entire twenty years lost while being frozen in forty-eight hours.  In that time he'll be an old man.  Could be a year, an hour, or all at once. Called NPA Syndrome.  Natural Pro- gression of Aging.  It affects each individual differently.  I'm sure it's painful.
L161313 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
L161312 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Edicon system made these.  Ages, photographs.  We use it to find missing children.
L161311 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I remember what he looks like.  I can't forget.
L161310 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Mug sheets.
L161309 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Fill it out.  Standard issue mal- practice insurance.  All Cops carry it.
L161308 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ What's this?
L161306 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
L161305 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
L161304 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Later.  I want Doucet first.
L161303 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I want to see my wife and kid.
L161302 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
L161301 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I'm not on the force anymore.
L161300 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Jury found you guilty, not me.  I just called it as I saw it.  Fuck that.  You were brought here for a reason.  Doucet's escaped.  Re-animated for his parole hearing.  Killed a lot of people.  Most of them cops.
L161299 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
L161298 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
L161297 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Shucks, and I got all dressed up.
L161296 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
L161295 +++$+++ u4821 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
L161890 +++$+++ u4819 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.
L161889 +++$+++ u4816 +++$+++ m321 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.
