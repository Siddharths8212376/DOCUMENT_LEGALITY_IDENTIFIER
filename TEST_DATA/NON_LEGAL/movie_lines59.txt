L60799 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ So hello.
L60798 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Just... Just wanted to say hello...
L60797 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Hey, what are you doing here?
L60632 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Fuck you.
L60631 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
L60630 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ I had that fire. He didn't listen!
L60629 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
L60628 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ ...Not now, Brian.
L60468 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Just leave me alone, okay?
L60467 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Brian, look --
L60466 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Thanks for the insight.
L60465 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
L60369 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today?  What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?
L60368 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
L60367 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
L60366 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I waited... I would have fucking waited...
L60365 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ You okay?
L60362 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us.
L60361 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
L60360 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Ready?
L60354 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Roll the hose.
L60353 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
L60352 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ You got a problem with drilling, probie?
L60351 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
L60349 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What, are you kidding? By myself?
L60348 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Roll the hose.
L60317 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Yeah... too bright...
L60316 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ This?
L60315 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind...
L60311 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ C'mon, let's crawl home.
L60310 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.
L60308 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
L60307 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
L60235 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Hey.
L60234 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Hey.
L60233 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
L60232 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Thanks.
L60185 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ -- Never mind.
L60184 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
L60170 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
L60169 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ -- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
L60168 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ -- I told you to stay next to me!
L60167 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Goddamn it Stephen!
L60166 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ -- You split the team, man. And what was that crap with the standpipe? You'd think you and a hose were never introduced before.
L60165 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ -- C'mon, Stephen.
L60164 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
L60138 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Hook us up to a stand-pipe.
L60137 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I'm in heaven, Lt.
L60136 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Ya love it, probie?
L60114 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
L60113 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
L60112 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
L60111 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...
L60110 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Thanks for the speakers.
L60109 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer.
L60108 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.
L60107 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
L60106 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
L60105 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Hey! You don't know me --
L60104 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
L60103 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
L60102 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Why'd you come here, Brian?
L60101 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ That was never proved.
L60100 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Yeah? What about Laura --
L60099 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Sheep don't count.
L60098 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
L60097 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ People actually used to pay you for this?
L60096 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ It worked when you were in sixth grade.
L60095 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ It works.
L60094 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ In the Field Museum once.
L60093 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ What, you've never seen one before?
L60092 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ My God, an actual operating 8-track.
L60090 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
L60089 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Been ripping off fire stations?
L60088 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ It's comin' along... want a beer?
L60087 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I like what you've done with the place.
L60054 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Well, see you're wrong already. Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we decided in the interest of brotherly love, that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the other side of town. So starting tomorrow, your assigned to company 17. My company.  One case of scotch, you're getting cheap in your old age, Brian...
L60053 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Not likely.
L60052 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.
L60051 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ So you're going to fight fires now, huh?
L60050 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
L60049 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?
L59962 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE.
L59961 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Who asked you?
L59960 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ It doesn't go like that.
L60908 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ It's a small town.
L60907 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I'll see ya around, huh?
L60906 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I don't have the slightest idea...
L60905 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What'll you do?
L60904 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I quit two days ago, Brian.
L60903 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
L60746 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ You're right.
L60745 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ That's a dumb thing to say.
L60744 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L60743 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Just take it.
L60742 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What is --
L60720 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
L60719 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
L60718 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Yes.
L60717 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Do you know what you're asking me to do?
L60716 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ You could check. It'd be in his files.
L60715 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I don't know anything about it.
L60714 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
L60713 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
L60712 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Hi.
L60711 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Hi.
L60647 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You knew what we were asking you to do. Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now. The fit isn't right.
L60646 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ -- I work for the city.
L60645 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
L60644 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Leave Stephen out of this --
L60643 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
L60642 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
L60641 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I was doing my job.
L60640 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ -- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
L60639 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
L60638 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ -- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
L60637 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
L60636 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
L60635 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Brian. What's wrong?
L60591 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Uh huh.
L60590 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.
L60587 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I wanted to be a good one.
L60586 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Then why did you quit?
L60585 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
L60584 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
L60583 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
L60582 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Homey.
L60581 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?
L60580 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies.
L60579 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Got anything to drink in there?
L60578 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Thanks for the invite.
L60576 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.
L60575 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
L60574 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
L60573 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
L60572 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
L60571 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
L60570 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Okay.
L60564 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Marty did.  But I wanted you to come to.
L60563 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Well, you did invite me here.
L60562 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You think that's really any of your business?
L60561 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
L60560 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
L60559 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
L60558 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Hi.
L60542 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
L60541 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I could use a date.
L60540 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here.
L60539 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
L60538 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
L60537 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ How's it going?
L60536 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Hey.
L60535 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Straightest answer your department's given me all week.
L60534 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Arson.
L60377 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Yeah...
L60376 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ ...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
L60375 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
L60284 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.
L60283 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
L60282 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ So now you suddenly care about my future?
L60281 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
L60280 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
L60279 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
L60252 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II.
L60251 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
L60250 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.
L60247 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?
L60246 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ -- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
L60245 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
L60244 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
L60243 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
L60242 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
L60241 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.
L60240 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?
L60239 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ When I was twenty.
L60238 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ With grenadine, right?
L60040 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
L60039 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.
L60035 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ What, you think I just dried up and blew away when you left? The world does turn once in awhile Brian, even without your permission.
L60034 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Really? No kidding.
L60033 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I work for city hall.
