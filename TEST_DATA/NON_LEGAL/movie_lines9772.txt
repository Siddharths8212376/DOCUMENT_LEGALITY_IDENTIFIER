L182497 +++$+++ u4996 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ DUDLEY +++$+++ I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. 
L182496 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What work?
L182495 +++$+++ u4996 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ DUDLEY +++$+++ You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.  You're not your old, cruel self anymore.  I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp.
L182165 +++$+++ u4996 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ DUDLEY +++$+++ You've got it, Wendell.
L182164 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Give me one minute.
L181868 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ How'd you get them to retract?
L181867 +++$+++ u4996 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ DUDLEY +++$+++ How what, Wendell?
L181866 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Of course... But how?
L181865 +++$+++ u4996 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ DUDLEY +++$+++ Will you work for me?
L181862 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Homicide?  A detective?
L181861 +++$+++ u4996 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ DUDLEY +++$+++ I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me the go-ahead on. A duty few men are fit for, but you were born for.  You'll be working out of Homicide.
L181860 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ How?
L181859 +++$+++ u4996 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ DUDLEY +++$+++ Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
L181858 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?
L181857 +++$+++ u4996 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ DUDLEY +++$+++ They're yours.  Take them.
L181856 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Doing what?  Mowing your fucking lawn?
L181855 +++$+++ u4996 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ DUDLEY +++$+++ Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
L181854 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ <u>What do you want</u>?
L181853 +++$+++ u4996 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ DUDLEY +++$+++ Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself
L181852 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Him and me both.  <u>Fucking Exley</u>.
L181851 +++$+++ u4996 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ DUDLEY +++$+++ Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing.
L181850 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ He helped me out once.  That's all.
L181849 +++$+++ u4996 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ DUDLEY +++$+++ It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
L181848 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  <u>He's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>.
L181847 +++$+++ u4996 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ DUDLEY +++$+++ And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
L181846 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah, I hate them.
L181845 +++$+++ u4996 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ DUDLEY +++$+++ Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell?
L181844 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Dudley, what do you want?
L181843 +++$+++ u4996 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ DUDLEY +++$+++ Call me Dudley.
L181842 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Captain, what do you want?
L181841 +++$+++ u4996 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ DUDLEY +++$+++ He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
L181840 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
L181839 +++$+++ u4996 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ DUDLEY +++$+++ Say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables.
L181838 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ This business, Captain?
L181837 +++$+++ u4996 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ DUDLEY +++$+++ Lad, may I have a word with you?
L181918 +++$+++ u5007 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ STENSLAND +++$+++ It's confidential, Bud.  Like that magazines Vincennes scams for. <u>Hush-Hush</u>.  I'll see you tomorrow.  And hey, if it works out, you'll get a piece of it.
L181917 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L181916 +++$+++ u5007 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ STENSLAND +++$+++ No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
L181915 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
L181914 +++$+++ u5007 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ STENSLAND +++$+++ Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
L181913 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
L181912 +++$+++ u5007 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ STENSLAND +++$+++ Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good.
L181756 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I got to write my report first.
L181755 +++$+++ u5007 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ STENSLAND +++$+++ Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.
L181722 +++$+++ u5007 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ STENSLAND +++$+++ Seen him around.  He used to be a cop.
L181721 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You know him?
L182323 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah.  A great big one.
L182322 +++$+++ u5002 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ MRS. LEFFERTS +++$+++ Was it... a rat?
L182320 +++$+++ u5002 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ MRS. LEFFERTS +++$+++ I came home that night and there was blood on the floor.  Susan said Stams -- Stens had cut himself.  They were acting nervous.  And that Stens kept going under the house.
L182319 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
L182318 +++$+++ u5002 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ MRS. LEFFERTS +++$+++ Don't mind the smell.  I think a rat died behind the wall... My Susie was a good girl!
L182317 +++$+++ u5002 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ MRS. LEFFERTS +++$+++ No!  Please leave!
L182316 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What's through here?
L182314 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You said a neighbor heard a ruckus.  Was it outside, inside?
L182313 +++$+++ u5002 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ MRS. LEFFERTS +++$+++ That's him.  That's him.
L182312 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Look at a picture for me.
L182311 +++$+++ u5002 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ MRS. LEFFERTS +++$+++ Maybe.  I don't know.
L182310 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Stens?  Was it Stens?
L182309 +++$+++ u5002 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ MRS. LEFFERTS +++$+++ We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
L182308 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What was that boyfriend's name?
L182307 +++$+++ u5002 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ MRS. LEFFERTS +++$+++ Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.
L182306 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Ma'am, I'm sure she was.
L182305 +++$+++ u5002 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ MRS. LEFFERTS +++$+++ First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
L182304 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Tell me about the boyfriend she had.  The one you mentioned at the morgue.
L182303 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Five minutes.  That's all.
L182302 +++$+++ u5002 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ MRS. LEFFERTS +++$+++ Let my daughter rest in peace.
L182301 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D.  I'd like to ask a couple of questions.
L182649 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I spent years trying not to live down to mine. 
L182648 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
L182647 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ A lot of bad stuff happened here. It's as good a place as any for it to end.
L182646 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ You figured this was a set-up? And you showed up anyway?
L182642 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
L182641 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You wanted to meet here?
L182625 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn.
L182624 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room?  Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.
L182618 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
L182617 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Bud...
L182599 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this.
L182598 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What about him?
L182597 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Ellis Loew.
L182590 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ <u>Lynn</u>.
L182589 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.
L182588 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ At least not anymore.
L182587 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
L182586 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
L182585 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
L182581 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
L182580 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ You expecting problems?
L182579 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Which one are you and which one am I?
L182578 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.
L182577 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ With a wrecking ball.  You want to help me swing it?
L182576 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down.
L182575 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.
L182574 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
L182573 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ What?
L182572 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Let's just kill them.
L182571 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett.
L182570 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ It's Dudley for the Nite Owl.
L182569 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ It all keeps coming back to Dudley.
L182568 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
L182567 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Dudley's guys.
L182566 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.
L182565 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Dudley.
L182564 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ It wasn't the Negroes.  The Griffith Park report was a phony. And, who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl?
L182563 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Somebody got wind of it, killed them all.
L182562 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
L182561 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
L182560 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ <u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
L182559 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
L182558 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
L182557 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them.
L182552 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ She told you?
L182551 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Lynn.
L182550 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Why?
L182172 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ You don't know what the word means, you dumb bastard.
L182171 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
L182170 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ How's it going to look on your report?
L182169 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Get the fuck away from me.
L182168 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ A naked guy with a gun?  You expect anyone to believe that?
L182161 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Officer White, put down that weapon and --
L182160 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ One in six.  Where's the girl?
L181954 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.
L181953 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What happened?
L181952 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
L181951 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah, that's Stens.
L181947 +++$+++ u4997 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ EXLEY +++$+++ It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?
L181946 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Where are we going?
L182015 +++$+++ u5004 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PATCHETT +++$+++ Of course... this is personal with you, isn't it, Mr. White?
L182014 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I got her address.
L182013 +++$+++ u5004 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PATCHETT +++$+++ No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
L182012 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
L182011 +++$+++ u5004 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PATCHETT +++$+++ There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
L182010 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What little studio?
L182009 +++$+++ u5004 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PATCHETT +++$+++ I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio.
L182008 +++$+++ u5004 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PATCHETT +++$+++ Wait.  Our deal still holds?
L182007 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
L182006 +++$+++ u5004 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PATCHETT +++$+++ I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
L182005 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
L182004 +++$+++ u5004 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PATCHETT +++$+++ Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling.
L182003 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ That's right.
L182002 +++$+++ u5004 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PATCHETT +++$+++ Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
L182001 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No.
L182000 +++$+++ u5004 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PATCHETT +++$+++ Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
L181999 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?
L181998 +++$+++ u5004 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PATCHETT +++$+++ Against your code?
L181997 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Thanks, but no thanks.
L181996 +++$+++ u5004 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PATCHETT +++$+++ He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.
L181995 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
L181992 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl. I'm investigating.
L181991 +++$+++ u5004 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PATCHETT +++$+++ Of course...
L181990 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
L181989 +++$+++ u5004 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PATCHETT +++$+++ You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
L181988 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
L181987 +++$+++ u5004 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PATCHETT +++$+++ I don't know him.  Mr...
L181986 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Richard Stensland.
L181985 +++$+++ u5004 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PATCHETT +++$+++ I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
L181984 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
L181983 +++$+++ u5004 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PATCHETT +++$+++ I am.  Are you soliciting for police charities?  The last time, you people called at my office.
L181982 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Are you Pierce Patchett?
L181714 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I'm not asking you.
L181713 +++$+++ u5004 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PATCHETT +++$+++ She's fine.
L182386 +++$+++ u5008 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ STOMPANATO +++$+++ I don't know.  I swear it!
L182385 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?
L182384 +++$+++ u5008 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ STOMPANATO +++$+++ Meeks is probably in Rio or someplace like that by now.
L182383 +++$+++ u5008 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ STOMPANATO +++$+++ Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
L182382 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?

L182297 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
L182296 +++$+++ u5005 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PINKER +++$+++ Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.

L182290 +++$+++ u5005 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PINKER +++$+++ It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
L182289 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?
L182288 +++$+++ u5005 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PINKER +++$+++ Susan Lefferts.
L182287 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Whose shoe?

L182285 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
L182284 +++$+++ u5005 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ PINKER +++$+++ What do you want to know?
