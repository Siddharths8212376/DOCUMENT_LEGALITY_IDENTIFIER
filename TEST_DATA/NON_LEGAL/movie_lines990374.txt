L564919 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
L564918 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Dolores.
L564915 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I'm absolutely positive.
L564914 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ You seem very sure about that.
L564913 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
L564912 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
L564911 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I don't want you to lie.
L564910 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ I won't lie.
L564909 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ They work for the people we're trying to sue.  Their job is to try to minimize damages.  Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs.  No good guys or bad guys.  Just our side and their side.
L564907 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
L564906 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
L564902 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Yes.  Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean and...
L564901 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ That you didn't die?  Like the other children?
L564900 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ You can only feel lucky that you didn't die for so long.  Then you start to feel...unlucky.
L564897 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ You hate that.
L564896 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ I don't like thinking about the accident.  I don't even remember it happening.  Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...
L565079 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ Thank you, Nicole.
L565078 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I have no questions.
L565041 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ And what was the weather like at this time?
L565040 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
L565035 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto
L565034 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Note my objection.  She said, 'As I'm talking.'
L565028 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I object to that form of question. Note that.
L565027 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?
L565018 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ Was the bus on time?
L565017 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I object to the form of that question.  Note that.
L564472 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ No.
L564471 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Have they ever been busted?
L564468 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ Wanda does these photographic things.  That's one of her pictures on the wall.
L564467 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Crafts?
L564466 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ Crafts.
L564465 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ What do they do?
L564464 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ They're smart.  Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.
L564463 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ That's good.  Judges like adopted Indian boys.  Tell me more about the Ottos.
L564462 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ Yes.
L564461 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Indian?
L564460 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
L564459 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Tell me about the Ottos.
L564453 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ There's the Prescots...
L564452 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ That's great, Wendell.  That's the sort of thing I need to know.  So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.
L564449 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ People who will help our cause.
L564448 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ What do you mean?
L564443 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ ...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and...
L564442 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ That's the local bar?
L564441 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ At school.  She fell for Kyle just before we graduated.  Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...
L564440 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ When?
L564439 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ She...she was a friend of mine.
L564438 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ What about Doreen?
L564421 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Hard to say.  I might have...some business here.
L564420 +++$+++ u8048 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ RISA +++$+++ Will you be spending more than a night?
L564419 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Do you have a room?
L564406 +++$+++ u8047 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Thanks.
L564405 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Here we go.
L564404 +++$+++ u8047 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Perfect.
L564403 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Is this it?
L564402 +++$+++ u8047 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Almost three.
L564401 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ How old is she?
L564400 +++$+++ u8047 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Tell me about it.
L564399 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ You always think you're prepared for these things.
L564398 +++$+++ u8047 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag.  I know my wife packed one in there...
L564397 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Need a hand?
L564894 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I love you, Zoe.  I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you.  No matter what happens.  I'll take care of you.
L564893 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ Oh God, I'm scared.
L564892 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.
L564891 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ I can hear you breathing, Daddy.
L564889 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Of...course I do.  I just thought...I could get you another
L564888 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
L564887 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Do you have the blood test?
L564886 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money.
L564885 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ What for?
L564884 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ I need money.
L564883 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want.
L564882 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ Welcome to hard times, Daddy.
L564881 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Yes.
L564880 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ I tested positive.
L564879 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Yes.
L564878 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?
L564877 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ No.  But this is.  They wouldn't take my blood.
L564876 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ That's not news, Zoe.
L564875 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ Okay.  I went to sell blood yesterday.  That's how it is.  I'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm selling my blood.
L564874 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Tell me your news, Zoe.
L564873 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
L564872 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
L564871 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ Don't you want to hear?
L564870 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ News?
L564869 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.
L564868 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Yes.
L564867 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ Daddy?
L564866 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Yes, I'll accept the charges.
L564396 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I...I just need to know what state you're in so I know...how to talk to you...how to act...
L564395 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ Why can't you talk to me?
L564394 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Yes.
L564393 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ DADDY!!!
L564390 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ 'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm?  Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?
L564389 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
L564388 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ So what's the problem?
L564387 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe.
L564386 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ Why am I calling you?  You're my father.  I'm not supposed to call you?  What's the matter with wanting to talk to you, Daddy?
L564385 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Why are you calling me, Zoe?
L564384 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?
L564383 +++$+++ u8054 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
L564382 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I'm in a car wash.
L564567 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Well, let's see what we get.
L564566 +++$+++ u8051 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ STEWARDESS +++$+++ I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
L564565 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...
L564564 +++$+++ u8051 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ STEWARDESS +++$+++ Yes.
L564563 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Is there shrimp on it?
L564562 +++$+++ u8051 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ STEWARDESS +++$+++ We do.
L564560 +++$+++ u8051 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ STEWARDESS +++$+++ Poached salmon.
L564559 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ What is it?
L564558 +++$+++ u8051 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ STEWARDESS +++$+++ I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
L564557 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
L564556 +++$+++ u8051 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ STEWARDESS +++$+++ Some more wine?
L564609 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ Do you have this agreement with you?
L564608 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.
L564607 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ No.
L564606 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ Are you expensive?
L564598 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Listen to me, Mrs Otto.  Listen very carefully.  I do know what's best.
L564597 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?
L564596 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Excuse me?
L564595 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ So you're just the thing we need.
L564591 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
L564590 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ You think someone else caused the accident?
L564589 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.
L564588 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ Dolores?
L564587 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ You are angry, aren't you, Mrs. Otto?  That's why I'm here.  To give your anger a voice.  To be your
L564586 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ Who did they get for that?
L564585 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief.
L564584 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ Their child died, and they got a lawyer.
L564583 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Yes.
L564582 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ You've been retained?
L564581 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ The Walkers spoke very highly of you.
L564576 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Please.
L564575 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ No.
L564574 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
L564573 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ You can't come here.
L564572 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I'm a lawyer.
L564571 +++$+++ u8052 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WANDA +++$+++ Who are you?
L564570 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this, Mrs. Otto, but the Walkers said you would understand.  I know it's an awful time, but it's important that we talk.
L564437 +++$+++ u8053 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WENDELL +++$+++ Don't know.  Food banks, welfare, church charity.  They scrape by.
L564436 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ How does the family survive?
L564435 +++$+++ u8053 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WENDELL +++$+++ Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze.
L564434 +++$+++ u8053 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WENDELL +++$+++ Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.
L564433 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Any criminal record?
L564432 +++$+++ u8053 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WENDELL +++$+++ Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart enough.
L564431 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ In what way?
L564430 +++$+++ u8053 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WENDELL +++$+++ Kyle Lambston's a drunk.  Nobody likes him.  He's a nasty piece of work.
L564423 +++$+++ u8045 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ No.
L564422 +++$+++ u8053 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ WENDELL +++$+++ Are you a reporter?
L565075 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  And that's all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all.  Then I was in the hospital.
L565074 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ What do you remember about the accident?
L565072 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Yes.  I do now.  Now that I'm telling it.
L565071 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ You remember this?
L565070 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
L565069 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ There wasn't time?
L565068 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ I was scared.  And there wasn't time.
L565067 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ Why not?
L565066 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ No.
L565065 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
L565064 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Yes.
L565063 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ You saw the speedometer?
L565062 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ I told you I was positive.  The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was.
L565061 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ You believe that the bus driven by Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time?
L565060 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Positive.
L565059 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
L565058 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Seventy-two miles an hour.
L565057 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going?  To the best of your recollection?
L565056 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Yes.  I looked.  I remember clearly now.  It seemed we were going too fast down the hill.  I was scared.
L565055 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ You could see the speedometer?
L565054 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
L565053 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ Mrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
L565052 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Dolores was driving too fast.
L565051 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ Why were you scared?
L565050 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Yes, I understand.
L565049 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
L565048 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ Why were you scared?
L565047 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ I was scared.
L565046 +++$+++ u8050 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ Yes.

L565037 +++$+++ u8046 +++$+++ m545 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly.
