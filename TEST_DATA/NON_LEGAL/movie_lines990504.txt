L648185 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Um...
L648184 +++$+++ u8863 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MR. FEUR +++$+++ Yes?
L648484 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ I'm sorry that I frightened you like that.  But I was so touched by your concern.  I've been lonely here.  Perhaps we could be friends.
L648483 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No.  No, I don't.
L648482 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ You must think I'm pathetic.
L648481 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there...  I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's in Boston.  He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.
L648480 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Um...sure.
L648479 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
L648478 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What?
L648477 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ Love.
L648475 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ You're going to think I'm crazy or something.
L648474 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
L648473 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ No.
L648470 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ And these roses.  They're much prettier up close.
L648469 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Thank you.
L648468 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ Your house is so beautiful.
L648467 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ Very much.
L648466 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Would you like some iced tea?
L648465 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ Right.  I'm sorry.
L648464 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ And then you weren't there.
L648463 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
L648462 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You do?
L648461 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ I wanted to apologize.
L648043 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Wait!  Don't go...
L648042 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying.  Please...
L648041 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'm sorry.  It's for the flowers.  Why don't you...
L648040 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ This fence...it's so...
L648039 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
L648038 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ I've never even met you.
L648037 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ That's not...It's not like that.
L648036 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
L648035 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Tell me.  I can help you.
L648034 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
L648033 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Tell me.  Please.
L648032 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ I can't, no, no, I can't...
L648031 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What?  What are you afraid of?
L648030 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ And I'm afraid.  Oh god, I'm so afraid of...
L648029 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Who?  Your husband?
L648028 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...
L648027 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ I'm not...
L648026 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Hello?
L648025 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Is everything alright?
L648024 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ I've seen you.  From the window.
L648023 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Um...yes.
L648022 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ You're the flower lady.
L648021 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
L648020 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ Who are you?
L648659 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.
L648658 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What was her major?
L648657 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Of course.
L648656 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
L648655 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I should be going anyway.
L648654 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ They're calling me in to work.
L648651 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You must have been very proud.
L648650 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close.
L648648 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ It's like that.  Doesn't seem real.  No note.  Nothing.  Cops say she'll be back.  I just wanna know what happened.
L648647 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't know.
L648646 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ Why are you here?
L648644 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ Well she wouldn't.  He left when she was twelve.  Never spoke about him after that.
L648643 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She never mentioned her father.
L648642 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
L648641 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
L648640 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ You look a little old for a student.
L648639 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's fine.
L648638 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense.
L648635 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ She never mentioned you.
L648634 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Claire.
L648633 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ What's your name?
L648630 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ Please leave me alone.
L648629 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No, I don't.
L648628 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ You know where she is?
L648627 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
L648626 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ Yeah.
L648625 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Mrs. Frank?
L648305 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
L648304 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ She got it.  Turned it down.
L648302 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ I'm not.  Couldn't pick up my cello for weeks.
L648301 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She's making this up.
L648300 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
L648299 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Do we have to?
L648298 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
L648297 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Stop.
L648296 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ You should have heard her play.
L648293 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Oh God...
L648292 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.
L648291 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ We were suite mates.
L648290 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ I came in from my room...
L648289 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ He was so pissed.
L648288 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ ...just so she could cut them off.
L648287 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I didn't sleep with him.
L648286 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Anyway, Claire slept with him...
L648285 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ He looked like one of the Monkees.
L648282 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ We know each other.
L648281 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ This is...
L648280 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Wow.
L648805 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Trust me, Claire.  You hear something... change the subject.  You find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake.  You know what happened.  The rest is only details.  And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those.  If you want to put this back together...just let it go.
L648804 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't know...
L648803 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ You've got a beautiful life.  And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you.  I've come to think that's all that really matters.
L648802 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
L648801 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I guess not.
L648800 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
L648799 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Jody he was lying.
L648798 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Did he say that?
L648797 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
L648770 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What is it?
L648769 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
L648768 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Like what?
L648767 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.
L648766 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ That could take days.  I need to do something now.  Don't you see?  She wants us dead.
L648765 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
L648764 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I can't believe this is happening.
L648763 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I know.
L648762 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Jody, she tried to kill him.
L648750 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No.  She wanted me to know the truth.  Now that I do...I think she's at peace.
L648749 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.
L648748 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
L648747 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ If she was dangerous before--
L648746 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't know.
L648745 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L648744 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?
L648743 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No.
L648742 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I'm a terrible friend.
L648741 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ All of us.
L648740 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I got there first.  Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman.  He seemed desperate not to lose you.  He promised to handle it.  And we all let it drop away.
L648739 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of Valium in your system?
L648738 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
L648737 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.
L648736 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I had just been left by Richard.  I was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed.
L648735 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Relieved?
L648734 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
L648733 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Why?
L648732 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse. She was young.  I should have said something right away. But I didn't.
L648731 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
L648730 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Adamant?
L648729 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I was down in Adamant...
L648728 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Oh God...you knew.
L648564 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
L648563 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Okay.  Okay.
L648562 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Please.
L648561 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ But Claire--
L648560 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
L648559 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
L648558 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Hartford?
L648557 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
L648556 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Did I?
L648555 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Something was there.  You saw it.
L648554 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
L648553 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Then what was it?
L648552 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
L648551 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ What?
L648550 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Jody, she's alive.
L648549 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Does Norman know?
L648548 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen.
L648547 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's alright.
L648546 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
L648545 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I think so
L648544 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Are you okay?
L648389 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Jody, wait.
L648388 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I have to go.
L648383 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her.
L648382 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Mef?  What's Mef?
L648381 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ M-E...
L648380 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Oh...
L648375 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Shhh.
L648374 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Nothing's happening.
L648371 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't know.
L648370 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?
L648369 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ This.
L648368 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ The planchette?
L648367 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Place your fingers on the planchette.
L648364 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
L648363 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Sit down here.
L648218 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
L648217 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Wow.  I'm losing it.
L648215 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I don't...
L648214 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ In the window.  Norman's at work.
L648213 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ What?
L648212 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Someone's there.
L648209 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Please.  That's all I need.
L648208 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
L648207 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ ...no...no...no...
L648206 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Telling you...
L648205 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Jody, no...
