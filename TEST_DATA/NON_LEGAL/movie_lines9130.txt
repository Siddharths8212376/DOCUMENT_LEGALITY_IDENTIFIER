L280018 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
L280017 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
L280016 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
L280015 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
L280014 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Just local, of course.
L280013 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ WHAT?
L280012 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  Especially for what he said, and I quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally." He helped me put out a press release.
L280011 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.  You told Dan Koretzky about this?
L280010 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I called Dan Koretzky because he --
L280009 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great.  I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way.
L280008 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You did that deliberately.  You knew all along I'd like them.  It was a trick.
L279998 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Ha.
L279997 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
L279996 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
L279995 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
L279994 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Where?
L279993 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Wanna go to dinner?
L279992 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Nothing.
L279991 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Hi.  What are you doing?
L279990 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Hi.
L279958 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No use.
L279957 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself.  Otherwise, what's the use?
L279956 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ How?  What would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice?
L279955 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You're being stupid.
L279954 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
L279953 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I'm alright.
L279952 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
L279951 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Harder.
L279950 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ More confident, maybe.
L279949 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You're tougher.
L279948 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
L279947 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
L279946 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
L279945 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
L279944 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ But what?
L279943 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No, but...
L279942 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
L279941 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
L279940 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ How?  How were we the same people?
L279939 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
L279938 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
L279937 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.
L279936 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery.
L279935 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
L279934 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ ... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.
L279932 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Okay.
L279931 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?
L279930 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Oh, great...
L279929 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ To make you feel better.
L279928 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
L279927 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
L279926 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something. Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.
L279925 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Okay, that's cool, okay.  But the nice time we just had... was it nicer, as nice, or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago?
L279924 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
L279923 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You know the difference.
L279922 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ What's the difference?
L279921 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
L279920 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
L279919 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ What it was like.
L279918 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Want to know what, exactly?
L279917 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ C'mon.  I want to know.
L279915 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Okay.
L279914 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Let's go home.  Okay?
L279913 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure.  I just... I need you, Rob.  That's it.  And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so...
L279912 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Mission accomplished.
L279911 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
L279910 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ What about Ian?
L279909 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
L279908 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
L279907 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I'm too tired not to go out with you.
L279906 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Laura...
L279904 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?
L279903 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Look, we can do other things.
L279902 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I didn't mean that.  I mean... was that all you used?
L279901 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
L279900 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
L279899 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
L279898 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You know, with Ray...
L279897 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today.
L279896 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Hi.
L279895 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
L279894 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ It'll have to be sex, then.
L279893 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
L279892 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
L279891 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ What?
L279890 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
L279889 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ When are you going back?
L279888 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ C'mon.
L279887 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ What do you want to do?
L279886 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I don't want to go back.
L279885 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
L279884 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
L279883 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ What do you mean?
L279882 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
L279881 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I can see why you say that.  Look, I'm sorry.  I really am.  The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared.  I just wanted you to know, that's all.
L279880 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You're also an idiot.
L279879 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Mmnn.
L279878 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You're soaking.
L279877 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Uh... No.
L279876 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
L279852 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Sure.  I'll see you on Friday.
L279851 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.
L279850 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yes, of course.
L279849 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Look, are you coming or not?
L279848 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
L279847 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Do you want me to be there?
L279846 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
L279845 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Me?
L279839 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ In a minute.  When I get it together.
L279838 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No, no.  When are you going home?
L279837 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L279817 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ My dad died.  My dad, my dad.
L279816 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Who the fuck's Pig?
L279815 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Pig died.
L279814 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.
L279813 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Pigsty.
L279812 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Are you alright?
L279811 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ God, that's a cold and a half.  Maybe you should bet back in bed.
L279810 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I can't talk right now.
L279809 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Guess who I just saw, right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, huh?
L279808 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Hey, how ya doin'?
L279807 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Hello.
L279804 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Well, think about it.
L279803 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I guess I am.
L279802 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You're being deliberately obtuse.
L279801 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
L279800 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.
L279799 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Okay, okay.  I get the picture.
L279798 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
L279797 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Sure they are.
L279796 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Those aren't mine.
L279795 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Don't forget your CDs.
L279792 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Oh ho, so very infrequently.
L279791 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
L279790 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Mmm hmm.
L279789 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You know I'm a good person.
L279788 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
L279787 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.
L279786 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I hate him too.  So I just call him "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy."
L279785 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Ray.  I hate Ian.
L279784 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
L279783 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
L279782 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place.
L279781 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Fix it up.  It'll make you feel better.
L279779 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You know what I mean.
L279778 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ That bad, eh?
L279777 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
L279776 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You still together?  Going all right?
L279775 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I'm sure.
L279774 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ It was kind of funny.
L279773 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
L279772 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
L279771 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
L279770 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Is that the last of it?
L279769 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
L279659 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No... not really... I mean, I think about it... but no, I don't really think about it.
L279658 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You don't ever think about other people?
L279657 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
L279656 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
L279655 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
L279654 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
L279653 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Are you still in love with me?
L279651 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I'm not -- hold on...
L279650 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
L279649 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I figured it was.  Where are you?
L279648 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ It's me.
L279647 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Hello.
L279642 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You do, huh.
L279641 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.
L279640 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I don't have your number.
L279639 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Will you call me?
L279638 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
L279637 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
L279636 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Nothing.
L279635 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?  The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you there?  What are you thinking?
L279634 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.
L279633 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.
L279630 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
L279629 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
L279628 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I guess.
L279627 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Is that why you wanted to see me?
L279626 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
L279625 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I told you I slept with him.
L279624 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Have you slept with him yet?
L279623 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ So, how are you?
L279577 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Great... That's great.
L279576 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ We'll talk some other time.
L279575 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
L279574 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
L279573 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
L279572 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
L279571 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Hi.
L279513 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Will you please just go?
L279512 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
L279511 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
L279510 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
L279509 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I haven't felt like it.
L279508 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Never?
L279507 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet.
L279506 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I don't know.
