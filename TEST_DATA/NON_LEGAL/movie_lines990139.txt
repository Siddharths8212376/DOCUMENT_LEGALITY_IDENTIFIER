L396593 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ It can wait.  Anything else?
L396592 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ There are important papers from --
L396591 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ That can wait till the weekend.
L396590 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
L396589 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
L396478 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ Yes, it most certainly is!
L396477 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Is that the Queen's request?
L396476 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ Go inside at once.
L396475 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her.  What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!
L396474 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ I thought I made myself perfectly clear.  You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it.
L396473 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L396472 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ No.
L396471 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
L396470 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
L396469 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well.
L396468 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Awaiting my orders.
L396403 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ Yes.  I do.
L396402 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Do you?
L396401 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ In matters concerning the Household, I act on her behalf.
L396400 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
L396399 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ There is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the Equerries.  No plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household.
L396398 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Aye, do.
L396397 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
L396396 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ That's not good enough.
L396395 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
L396394 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ I need a man who knows where I am.
L396393 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ Her Highness' Equerry.
L396392 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Who'll bring it to me?
L396391 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ You'll be sent a message.
L396390 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ How will I know what she requires?
L396389 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ I'm sorry?
L396388 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ How will I know?
L396387 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it.  The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever.  As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five.  No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock.  You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.
L396956 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
L396955 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ She'll think I betrayed her.
L396954 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ In time, she will.
L396953 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ She'll never understand it.
L396952 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ For once in my life, I am not the issue.
L396951 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ I promised to protect her from people like you.
L396950 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ No love.
L396949 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ No loyalty.
L396948 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ The greasy pole.
L396947 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Too busy looking after themselves.
L396946 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ They aren't as watchful as you.
L396945 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it.
L396944 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ See what?
L396943 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ They don't see it.
L396942 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ She trusts you, John.
L396941 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Her mind is set.  She won't change now.
L396940 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.
L396939 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ So...?
L396938 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ Ah, but therein lies the paradox.  It is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents.  The longer she is away, the stronger they become; and who, honestly, can promise security against that?  However many doors you lock, someone will always get in. Even here.
L396937 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Why do you think I keep her here?
L396936 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.
L396934 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ No other aspiration?
L396933 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ I said.  I serve the Queen.
L396932 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ But yourself?  What about John Brown?
L396931 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Aye.
L396930 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ For Her Majesty.
L396929 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ I do what I do.
L396928 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
L396927 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Why?
L396926 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ Then I envy yo.
L396925 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Maybe, once.
L396924 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ Was there never ambition?
L396923 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ What I do, I do for my Queen.
L396922 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ Surely --
L396921 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ I wouldn't know.
L396920 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.
L396918 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ This is the top.
L396917 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ Oh.
L396916 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ I'm not married.
L396915 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
L396914 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ It's nothing.
L396913 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ You're injured.
L396912 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ I'm fine.
L396911 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ Forgive me, I've called you out and you should have been resting.
L396910 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ I don't think about it.
L396909 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God.  You must miss such magnificent views.
L396908 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ I've been called back to London.  My last day.  I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar.
L396907 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ You sent for me.
L396879 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ Quite.
L396878 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's Gladstone.
L396876 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ If you hunt, you kill.
L396875 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
L396874 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Dare say you can be taught.
L396873 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ Occasionally.
L396872 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Do you hunt?
L396871 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ I am a blank sheet.
L396870 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ What do you know about the Highlands?
L396869 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen.  It was remiss of me not to come earlier.
L396868 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ What brings you here?
L397018 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Yes.  Yes it was.
L397017 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
L397016 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ You should never have gone out in such foul weather.
L396972 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Because I have to! 
L396971 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Then why send me back to them?!
L396970 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ -- When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there...!  All I've ever thought about is you!
L396969 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ I will not hear any more about my safety!!  You made me a promise and now you have broken it!
L396968 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
L396967 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
L396966 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ I'm breaking no promises!
L396965 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ -- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
L396964 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Have I ever let you down before--?
L396963 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
L396962 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
L396961 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Duty?!  You talk about duty?!
L396847 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ The Queen forbids it.  I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please.
L396846 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this.  I leave for Deeside --
L396845 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ I do not accept.
L396844 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
L396843 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Yes?
L396842 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Ma'am?
L396841 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.
L396840 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Has someone seen to those bruises?
L396839 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.
L396838 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ I was told you were in a fight.
L396837 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Yes, ma'am?
L396836 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ John?
L396769 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ I'll decide when it's exaggerated.
L396768 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
L396767 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
L396766 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Am I not safe enough with you, John?
L396765 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch what I eat next.
L396764 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
L396763 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Must they always follow us?
L396680 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ I heard something.
L396679 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ What is it, John?  John?
L396671 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Aye.
L396670 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ To keep out the cold.
L396669 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ We took a nip of whiskey.
L396615 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Ah, well...
L396614 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
L396613 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ They're ready now.
L396585 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming.  Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson.
L396584 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you.
L396583 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Of course I shall say what I have to say.  I always do.
L396582 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
L396581 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
L396580 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
L396579 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
L396578 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ That doesn't make him an expert.
L396577 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
L396576 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ What does he know about the Highlands?
L396575 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
L396574 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Who by?
L396573 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ I am told so.
L396572 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Are they worth reading?
L396571 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ I am thinking of publishing my "Highland Journals."
L396570 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Craobhan-geanmchno...  How can I possibly say that with a straight face?!
L396569 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
L396568 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Those, over there, there.
L396567 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ What?
L396566 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ What are those?
L396495 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Yes.
L396494 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Aye, ma'am.
L396493 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?
L396492 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--
L396491 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.
L396489 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ He thought so, yes.
L396488 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ It's a fine spot, ma'am.
L396487 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.
L396486 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ And I intend to be there when she's ready.
L396485 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
L396484 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her.
L396483 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Then why do you persist in doing it?
L396482 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.
L396481 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
L396480 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.
L396479 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Mr Brown.
L396422 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.
L396421 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Yes.  That will be company for you.
L396420 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Archie.
L396419 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.
L396418 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
L396417 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
L396416 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ I'm glad of it.
L396415 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.
L396414 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ She's well, too.
L396413 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ And the pony?
L396412 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ I am.
L396411 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ You are well?
L396410 +++$+++ u6696 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ BROWN +++$+++ Aye, ma'am.
L396409 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ You are here safely.
