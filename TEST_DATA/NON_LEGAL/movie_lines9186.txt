L315410 +++$+++ u1616 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ A bit.
L315409 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Her knee acting up?
L315408 +++$+++ u1616 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I saw Sarah the other day.
L315407 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ What can I tell you?
L315406 +++$+++ u1616 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I know you. How come you're so tense today?
L315405 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ How do you know?
L315404 +++$+++ u1616 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
L316235 +++$+++ u1625 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ STERN +++$+++ I'venever understood you, you know that? You were by far the best pupil I've ever had, bar none. Intellectu- ally, you were the most original, the most imaginative. Who knows, maybe you've been "elected" to see demons. Maybe you're in touch with ... some- thing. Nothing would surprise me about you Jacob. Nothing.
L316234 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Hell, you think I am?
L316233 +++$+++ u1625 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ STERN +++$+++ Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
L316232 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ But I see them.
L316231 +++$+++ u1625 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ STERN +++$+++ Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
L316230 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
L316229 +++$+++ u1625 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ STERN +++$+++ Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?
L316228 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I need your insight, your intuition.
L316227 +++$+++ u1625 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ STERN +++$+++ I don't know what to say.
L316226 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
L316225 +++$+++ u1625 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ STERN +++$+++ Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
L316224 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Christ, I know how it sounds.
L316223 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I see them, Prof. Everywhere. They're invading my life.
L316222 +++$+++ u1625 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ STERN +++$+++ I know very little about demons, Ja- cob, fleshy ones anyway. I know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... Dante, Milton ... but Jacob,  this is the 20th Century. We don't see demons now.
L316221 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Yes.
L316220 +++$+++ u1625 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ STERN +++$+++ See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
L316219 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ No.  I see them.
L316218 +++$+++ u1625 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ STERN +++$+++ Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
L316217 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I've got a problem, Prof. More Augus- tine than Kierkegaard, if you know what I mean.  I need to know about ... demons.
L316216 +++$+++ u1625 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ STERN +++$+++ Well, try not to get burned. You have a great mind, Jacob. Don't let anyone tempt you away from it.
L316215 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
L316214 +++$+++ u1625 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ STERN +++$+++ Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
L316213 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
L316212 +++$+++ u1625 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ STERN +++$+++ Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
L316211 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
L316210 +++$+++ u1625 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ STERN +++$+++ Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
L316209 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
L316208 +++$+++ u1625 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ STERN +++$+++ Ah!
L316207 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I haven't seen her in months.
L316206 +++$+++ u1625 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ STERN +++$+++ And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
L316205 +++$+++ u1625 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ STERN +++$+++ Likewise.
L316204 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ It's good to see you.
L316203 +++$+++ u1625 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ STERN +++$+++ Ah. Neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night ... I always admired that.
L316202 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ The postal service. I'm a mailman.
L316201 +++$+++ u1625 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ STERN +++$+++ Are you in the service?
L315483 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me.
L315482 +++$+++ u1621 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
L315481 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
L315480 +++$+++ u1621 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
L315479 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Whataya mean, no record?
L315478 +++$+++ u1621 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ I'm sorry but there's no record of a Jacob Singer in our files.
L315477 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Jacob Singer.
L315476 +++$+++ u1621 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ What's your name?
L315475 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
L315474 +++$+++ u1621 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
L315473 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.
L315472 +++$+++ u1621 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ Not according to my charts. Do you have an appointment?
L315471 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ New? He's been here for years.
L315470 +++$+++ u1621 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ Carlson? Is he new here?
L315469 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please.
L315946 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Save me!
L315945 +++$+++ u1624 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Jacob, what can I do?
L315939 +++$+++ u1624 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time.
L315938 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I'm not dead. I am not dead.
L315623 +++$+++ u1624 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I thought you said it was a nightmare?
L315622 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
L315621 +++$+++ u1624 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Go to sleep.
L315620 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ She was good in bed, though.
L315619 +++$+++ u1624 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
L315618 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
L315617 +++$+++ u1624 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I don't want to know.
L315616 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
L315615 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.
L315614 +++$+++ u1624 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ It's not healthy with it closed.
L315613 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
L315612 +++$+++ u1624 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I'm not cold.
L315611 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ It's freezing.
L315610 +++$+++ u1624 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ What was that?
L315909 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Goddamn it. I want Louis.
L315908 +++$+++ u1622 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ RESIDENT +++$+++ I don't have to ask if you can feel that.
L315907 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ No. Don't move me.
L315906 +++$+++ u1622 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ RESIDENT +++$+++ I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little.
L315901 +++$+++ u1622 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ RESIDENT +++$+++ We better get an orthopedic man in here. Is Dr. Davis on call?
L315900 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had.
L315899 +++$+++ u1622 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ RESIDENT +++$+++ Who did?
L315898 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ They stole it.
L315894 +++$+++ u1622 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ RESIDENT +++$+++ Your back? Did you fall?
L315893 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ My back. I can't move. I need my chiropractor.
L316327 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ You know who I am.
L316326 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
L316325 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
L316324 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ WHO ARE YOU?
L316322 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise.  A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up.
L316321 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Goddamn you!
L316320 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
L316319 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Oh God!
L316318 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
L316317 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ This isn't happening.
L316315 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
L316314 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Where have they gone?
L316313 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ It's over, Jake. It's all over.
L316312 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ No! What's going on? Where's my family?
L316311 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Sit down!
L316310 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Where are they?
L316309 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Sit down, Jake.
L316308 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
L316300 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
L316299 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Do what? I haven't done a thing.
L316298 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.
L316297 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
L316296 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Don't be funny.
L316295 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Where's West? New Jersey?
L316294 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ West.
L316293 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Oh?  Where you going?
L316292 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
L316291 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
L316290 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Mid-town mostly.
L316289 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
L316288 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Then don't bug me.
L316287 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ You can have anything you want.
L316286 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
L316285 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
L316284 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
L316283 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
L316282 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I'm tired.
L316281 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Jake, what is it?
L316280 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I'm not upset.
L316279 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ You look upset.
L316278 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.
L316277 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ What'd you do that for? It's an in- teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street.  Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?
L316272 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!
L316271 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Well leave then. Go to Hell.
L316270 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
L316269 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ You know goddamn well what I mean.
L316268 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
L316267 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
L316266 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ You've lived with me for two years.
L316265 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I don't know you.
L316264 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
L316263 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Why won't you answer me?
L316256 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.
L316255 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.
L316251 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ With wings.  You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
L316250 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ So tell me ... am I still an angel?
L316179 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
L316178 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
L316177 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
L316176 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ WHO ARE YOU?
L316172 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ You have quite a mind, Jake. I loved your friends. That chemist - the Ladder. What an imagination you have!
L316171 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Who are you? What are you doing to me?
L316170 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
L316169 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
L316168 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ What's going on?
L316167 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
L316166 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Where have they gone?
L316165 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ It's over, Jake. It's all over.
L316164 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ No! What's going on? Where's my family?
L316163 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Sit down.
L316162 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Where are they?
L316161 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Sit down, Jake.
L316160 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ What're you ... ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
L316132 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Oh yeah?  Try leavin' without me.
L316131 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I love you when you're angry.
L316130 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
L316129 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.
L316128 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Please.
L316127 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I promise.
L316126 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Bullshit!
L316125 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
L316124 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ I can waitress. I'm good.
L316123 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
L316122 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.

L316120 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
L316117 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ It's so hard to believe.
L316116 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
L316115 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.

L316108 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.

L316032 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
