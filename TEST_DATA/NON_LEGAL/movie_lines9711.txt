L144214 +++$+++ u4620 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ DRAGLINE +++$+++ Why sure, Luke. I mean I didn't talk to them about that. But why not? They're reasonable, Luke. Hell, we only been gone a coupla hours.

L144212 +++$+++ u4620 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ DRAGLINE +++$+++ Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.
L144211 +++$+++ u4623 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Is that your answer, Old Man? You're a hardcase too, ain't you?
L144206 +++$+++ u4620 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ DRAGLINE +++$+++ But what am I gonna do all by myself?  Oh if'n I hadn't lost mah head. I only had two more years to go. But when I saw you tearin' down with that truck... But you right Luke. We oughta split up. Be safer for us both.

L144202 +++$+++ u4620 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ DRAGLINE +++$+++ But, Luke...
L144201 +++$+++ u4623 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I've done enough world-shakin' for a while. You do the rest for me. Send me a postcard about it.
L144200 +++$+++ u4620 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ DRAGLINE +++$+++ What you mean, Luke?
L144199 +++$+++ u4623 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.

L144196 +++$+++ u4620 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ DRAGLINE +++$+++ Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
L144194 +++$+++ u4620 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ DRAGLINE +++$+++ And all the time you was plannin' on runnin' again.
L144193 +++$+++ u4623 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.
L144192 +++$+++ u4620 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ DRAGLINE +++$+++ Don't hit me no more, Boss! Don't hit me! I'll do anythin' you say but just don't hit me! Oh Luke. You are an original, you truly are. You really fooled them.
L143940 +++$+++ u4620 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ DRAGLINE +++$+++ Oh, that's mah darlin' Luke. Grins like a baby and bites like a 'gator.
L143939 +++$+++ u4623 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Sure do... that's why we didn't bet with the Navy.
L143928 +++$+++ u4620 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ DRAGLINE +++$+++ Knock it off, Luke! You cain't talk about Him that way.
L143927 +++$+++ u4623 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Look at Him go. Bam! Bam!
L143848 +++$+++ u4620 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ DRAGLINE +++$+++ Us elephants may be a lil slow, like in makin' love, but you give us a coupla three days to really get with it an' man -- stand back!
L143847 +++$+++ u4623 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Like an elephant.
L143846 +++$+++ u4620 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ DRAGLINE +++$+++ 'Atsa sign I got me an affectionate nature.
L143845 +++$+++ u4623 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You ol' sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn't have nothin' to worry about.
L143844 +++$+++ u4620 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ DRAGLINE +++$+++ Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
L143843 +++$+++ u4623 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ We got it locked in the sock.
L143842 +++$+++ u4620 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ DRAGLINE +++$+++ What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.
L143841 +++$+++ u4623 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
L143840 +++$+++ u4620 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ DRAGLINE +++$+++ Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
L143839 +++$+++ u4623 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Fifty's a nice round number.
L143838 +++$+++ u4620 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ DRAGLINE +++$+++ Why'd you have to say fifty? Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
L143743 +++$+++ u4623 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ That's it. That's the end.
L143742 +++$+++ u4620 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ DRAGLINE +++$+++ Where'd the road go?
L143732 +++$+++ u4623 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
L143731 +++$+++ u4620 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ DRAGLINE +++$+++ They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.
L143724 +++$+++ u4623 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ The man wants speed, let's give it to him. Ram it in and break it off. Go hard. Shag it.
L143723 +++$+++ u4620 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ DRAGLINE +++$+++ Hey, buddy. Take it easy. You're making me look bad.
L143709 +++$+++ u4620 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ DRAGLINE +++$+++ Cool Hand Luke.

L143676 +++$+++ u4620 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ DRAGLINE +++$+++ I'm gonna kill you, you go on...
L143668 +++$+++ u4623 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Stop beatin', man. You ain't doin' nobody no good.
L143667 +++$+++ u4620 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ DRAGLINE +++$+++ Whatta you mean, forget it?
L143645 +++$+++ u4620 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ DRAGLINE +++$+++ Boy. You jus' asking to be handled!
L143644 +++$+++ u4623 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
L143643 +++$+++ u4620 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ DRAGLINE +++$+++ Shut your mouth 'bout my Lucille.
L143640 +++$+++ u4623 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Innocent?
L143639 +++$+++ u4620 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ DRAGLINE +++$+++ That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.
L143638 +++$+++ u4623 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Lucille? Where do you get that?
L143613 +++$+++ u4620 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ DRAGLINE +++$+++ Long enough to see redhots come and redhots go.
L143612 +++$+++ u4623 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Maybe he's been chain-ganging too long.
L143603 +++$+++ u4623 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ But damn if he don't look like a fat old Dragline.
