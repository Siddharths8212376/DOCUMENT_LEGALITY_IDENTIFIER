L499887 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ Who are you?
L499886 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ What happened to Sam?
L499885 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ it will be all right, madam.
L499884 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ No Juliet?!
L499829 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted to be an actor.  I am sorry, Will.
L499828 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ It is over.
L499825 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Nobody knew!
L499824 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!
L499878 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ I don't know. It's a mystery.
L499877 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ How will it?
L499876 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.
L499875 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Go on.
L499874 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ The show must … you know
L499873 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What do we do now?
L499872 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ Another little problem.
L499860 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ I don't know, it's a mystery.
L499859 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ How will it?
L499858 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ No, it will turn out well.
L499857 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ We are lost.
L499730 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
L499729 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ By God, I wish I knew.
L499416 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?!  What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life?
L499415 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ Juliet? You mean Ethel.
L499398 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What?
L499397 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ The one who came with your letter?
L499396 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Romeo.
L499395 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ What? Who?
L499394 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Cut round him for now.
L499362 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go
L499361 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
L499360 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ We are about to embark on a great voyage.
L499359 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ Nobody. The author.
L499349 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.
L499348 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
L499256 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Tomorrow
L499255 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
L499254 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I did not.
L499253 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?
L499206 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yes. Nearly.  It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part.
L499205 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ Will! Have you finished?
L499187 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
L499186 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!
L499144 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ Is it about a pirate's daughter?
L499143 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I feel a scene coming on.
L499105 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ To the Palace at Whitehall.
L499104 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ Now where? Will?
L499076 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ To my weekly confession.
L499075 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ Where are you going?
L499073 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No, then.
L499072 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
L499071 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
L499070 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ Fifty pounds? What for?
L499069 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?
L499067 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
L499066 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
L499065 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Who wrote that?
L499064 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
L499063 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What piece? Richard Crookback?
L499062 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -
L499061 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
L499060 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
L499059 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ She is always Aphrodite.
L499058 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ Who is she this time?!
L499057 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ As soon as I have found my muse
L499056 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ God be praised!  Locked?
L499055 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ It is all locked safe in here
L499054 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
L499053 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
L499052 +++$+++ u7557 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ HENSLOWE +++$+++ Will! Where is my play? Tell me you have it nearly done! Tell me you have it started.  You have begun?
L499243 +++$+++ u7558 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ MARLOWE +++$+++ A different one you haven't written?
L499242 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ This is a different one.
L499241 +++$+++ u7558 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ MARLOWE +++$+++ I thought your play was for Burbage.
L499240 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Good luck with yours, Kit.
L499237 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Mercutio…good name.
L499236 +++$+++ u7558 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ MARLOWE +++$+++ His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio.
L499235 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ The daughter of his enemy.
L499234 +++$+++ u7558 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ MARLOWE +++$+++ The daughter of his enemy.
L499233 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Do you think?
L499232 +++$+++ u7558 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ MARLOWE +++$+++ Ethel.
L499231 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yes, that's good. Until he meets
L499230 +++$+++ u7558 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ MARLOWE +++$+++ Romeo is…Italian. Always in and out of love.
L499229 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
L499228 +++$+++ u7558 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ MARLOWE +++$+++ What is the story?
L499227 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.  Yes, I know.
L499226 +++$+++ u7558 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ MARLOWE +++$+++ And yours?
L499225 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Good title.
L499224 +++$+++ u7558 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ MARLOWE +++$+++ I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.
L499223 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
L499222 +++$+++ u7558 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ MARLOWE +++$+++ Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
L499221 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
L499220 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
L499219 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I have. And chinks to show for it.
L499218 +++$+++ u7558 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ MARLOWE +++$+++ Burbage says you have a play.
L499217 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Wonderful, wonderful.
L499216 +++$+++ u7558 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ MARLOWE +++$+++ How goes it, Will?
L499215 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Kit
L499409 +++$+++ u7570 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA AS ROMEO +++$+++ "Out of her favour where I am in love."
L499408 +++$+++ u7559 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ NOL AS BENVOLIO +++$+++ "Of love?"
L499407 +++$+++ u7570 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA AS ROMEO +++$+++ "Out."
L499404 +++$+++ u7570 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA AS ROMEO +++$+++ "Not having that which, having, makes them short."
L499403 +++$+++ u7559 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ NOL AS BENVOLIO +++$+++ It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"
L499402 +++$+++ u7570 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA AS ROMEO +++$+++ "Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?"
L499401 +++$+++ u7559 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ NOL AS BENVOLIO +++$+++ "But new struck nine."
L499400 +++$+++ u7570 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA AS ROMEO +++$+++ "Is the day so young?"
L499399 +++$+++ u7559 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ NOL AS BENVOLIO +++$+++ "Good morrow, cousin."
L499851 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ Thank you. Let go, there's a good nurse.
L499850 +++$+++ u7560 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ God bless you!
L499849 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ I will.
L499848 +++$+++ u7560 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ Be good to her, my lord!
L499612 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ Will you ask Her Majesty to be patient?!
L499611 +++$+++ u7560 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
L499610 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ Not ready? Where is she?
L499427 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master.
L499426 +++$+++ u7560 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
L499425 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance!
L499424 +++$+++ u7560 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
L499423 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ Two hours at prayer!
L499301 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
L499300 +++$+++ u7560 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
L499299 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
L499298 +++$+++ u7560 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ He looks well enough for a mountebank.
L499297 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
L499296 +++$+++ u7560 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ Your mother, and your father
L499294 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ A comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of Romeo to be the very same Capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his Montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the Pirate King!
L499293 +++$+++ u7560 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ Verona again.
L499292 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona.
L499165 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players.
L499164 +++$+++ u7560 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ As a nurse.
L499163 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play.  I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .
L499162 +++$+++ u7560 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ Like Valentine and Silvia?
L499161 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
L499160 +++$+++ u7560 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
L499159 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ I am not so well-born.
L499158 +++$+++ u7560 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ Playhouses are not for well-born ladies.
L499157 +++$+++ u7560 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ Be still.
L499156 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ But at the playhouse. Nurse?
L499155 +++$+++ u7560 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ When the Queen commands it.
L499154 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?
L499153 +++$+++ u7560 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ I liked the dog, for laughs.
L499152 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.
L499657 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Oh, but they can!
L499656 +++$+++ u7561 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true.
L499654 +++$+++ u7561 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ Above Lord Wessex?
L499653 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ And I love poetry above all.
L499652 +++$+++ u7561 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ And--?
L499651 +++$+++ u7561 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ They are not acted for you, they are acted for me.
L499650 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
L499649 +++$+++ u7561 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
L499648 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Your Majesty
L499647 +++$+++ u7561 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ What do you love so much?
L499646 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Your Majesty.
L499645 +++$+++ u7561 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond.
L499644 +++$+++ u7561 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ Stand up straight, girl.
L499643 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Your Majesty.
L499952 +++$+++ u7561 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ Give it to Master Kent. He will see it rightfully home. WESSEX gives his purse to VIOLA.
L499951 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ Fifty shillings.  Pounds.
L499950 +++$+++ u7561 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
L499949 +++$+++ u7561 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.
L499948 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ Indeed I am a bride short. How is this to end?
L499947 +++$+++ u7561 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
L499946 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ Your Majesty!
L499943 +++$+++ u7561 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ There was a wager, I remember…as to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today.  You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?
L499942 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ Your Majesty
L499587 +++$+++ u7565 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ SAM AS JULIET +++$+++ By and by I come to cease thy strife and leave me to my grief. A thousand times good night!"
L499586 +++$+++ u7562 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ RALPH AS NURSE +++$+++ "Madam!"
L499585 +++$+++ u7565 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ SAM AS JULIET +++$+++ "I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--"
L499584 +++$+++ u7562 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ RALPH AS NURSE +++$+++ "Madam!"
