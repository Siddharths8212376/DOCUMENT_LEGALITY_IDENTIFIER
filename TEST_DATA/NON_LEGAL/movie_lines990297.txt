L508773 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Hey -- your prayers have been answered. I'm leaving.  In just a couple of days.
L508765 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ You have a phone call.
L508764 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ You sent for me?
L508758 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ The majority has spoken.
L508757 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ But... wait a minute...
L508756 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
L508755 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ A vote?
L508754 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
L508753 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
L508750 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ The council of Cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire Catholic church.  They command the utmost respect. Your more... secular entertainment would be wholly out of place.
L508749 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ What do you mean?
L508748 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
L508644 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ And I am refusing.  As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.
L508643 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Please let me try.  I'm begging you.
L508642 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Out of the question.
L508641 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.
L508640 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
L508639 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Exactly.  People like going to theaters and casinos.  But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.
L508638 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
L508637 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I was thinking Las Vegas.  Get some butts in those seats.
L508525 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ The choir, Mary Clarence.  Go for the gold.
L508524 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
L508523 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ You're my Olympic event.
L508522 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ No.  No.
L508521 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart.  As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
L508520 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ You have, I believe, some minimal background in music.  Therefore, you are to join our choir.
L508519 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ What?
L508518 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
L508517 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I am?
L508516 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
L508515 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come true?  Your Olympic event?
L508514 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
L508513 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
L508512 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
L508511 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
L508510 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
L508509 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would happen!
L508508 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
L508507 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ So... hi there.
L508403 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Look, this isn't my kind of thing!  I wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters! I don't do that! I'm a star!
L508402 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
L508401 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!
L508400 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.
L508399 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Really catching on.
L508376 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ How to put it... ah, Of course, Mary Clarence.  "No pain, no gain."
L508375 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ In English?
L508374 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
L508373 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ It never solves anything.
L508372 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  Such as your own, for example.  How do you feel about physical labor?
L508371 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Sometimes it's not enough!
L508370 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ We are nuns.  We seek solutions through prayer.
L508369 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Have you been out in those streets?  Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!
L508368 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
L508367 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough.  I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age.  I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.
L508366 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ A balloon and a banana!  Tell me, Mary Clarence, what were you thinking?
L508364 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Mary Clarence!
L508363 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's important, nowadays.  You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.
L508334 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Come, Sister.
L508333 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I got it.
L508332 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood?
L508331 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Yeah?
L508283 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. 
L508282 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ What's wrong with my life?
L508281 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
L508280 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting.
L508279 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
L508278 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery?
L508277 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Your cell is more than adequate.
L508276 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Oh, I don't know... Satan?
L508275 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ And whom would you call?
L508274 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
L508273 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Useless distractions.
L508272 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?
L508271 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
L508270 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ You were right the first time.  Is this like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture?
L508269 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Your cell.  Your room.
L508268 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ My what?
L508267 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
L508266 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ That's tomorrow!  Don't you have any snacks?  Machines?
L508265 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Yes.  Until breakfast.
L508264 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Is this all the food I get?
L508255 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ No food.  Not until sundown.
L508254 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ No food?
L508253 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
L508252 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ A what?
L508251 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.
L508248 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Until sundown.
L508247 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Silence?  No talking?  All day?
L508246 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
L508245 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ A what?
L508244 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
L508234 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I'm outta here.
L508233 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ And the vow of chastity.
L508232 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Like to who?
L508231 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ The vow of obedience.
L508230 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ No problem.
L508229 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows that every nun must accept.  The vow of poverty...
L508228 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Mary Clarence?  Like a guy?  Like a dumb guy?
L508227 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
L508226 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!
L508225 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
L508224 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ No!  No!  I can't do this!
L508223 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Can do.
L508222 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
L508220 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Would you like that?
L508219 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"
L508218 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Deal.
L508217 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
L508216 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?
L508215 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Of course.  But it's almost lunch.
L508214 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Fine.  Got it.  Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right?  I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice.  So here's the deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug me.  I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low.  So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb.  Capisce?
L508213 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Check your driver's license.
L508212 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ What's a concubine?
L508211 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
L508210 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ You mean black people?
L508209 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ And all those like you.
L508208 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Are you talking about me?
L508207 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.  Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
L508206 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ What?
L508205 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ It has come to pass.
L508204 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Your cigarette -- out.
L508203 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ What? 
L508202 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Miss Van Cartier.
L508200 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ What?
L508199 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Sit down.
L508198 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
L508197 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ I see.
L508196 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
L508195 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ The reason?
L508194 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?
L508193 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ You were unhappy?
L508192 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
L508191 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ St. Anne's?
L508190 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Oh my God.  This isn't happening, tell me this isn't happening.  It's a nightmare, I'm back at St. Anne's!
L508189 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Very well.
L508188 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ That's my real name!  Currently I'm a singer.  Sort of.
L508187 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Enough joking.
L508186 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
L508185 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Your name?
L508184 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Mother Theresa.  Gandhi.  Don't you understand?  This is all a mistake.  I'm the good guy.  I'm the witness.  And I'm being punished!
L508183 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ What is your full name?  Your Christian name?
L508182 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ A convent?  They put me in a convent? What's the problem?  Wasn't there any more room in Hell?
L509053 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Yeah, like what?
L509052 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
L509051 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent.  So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun?
L509046 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ That depends.  Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news.  I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
L509045 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Don't you have a concert to go to?
L508852 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Even nuns have to pee.
L508851 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What're you doing?
L508844 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Nuns?
L508843 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
L508842 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
L508841 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ That's not the point!  They need me!
L508840 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I think they'd understand.
L508839 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.
L508833 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
L508832 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
L508831 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What?
L508830 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I can't go with you.
L508829 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Long story.  His goons will be here any minute.  We've got to get you out of here '- now!
L508828 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ How?
L508827 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Vince knows you're here.
L508717 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I know, I know.  I'll be careful.  I'll try.
L508716 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
L508715 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I've got to go.
L508712 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...
L508711 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I have?
L508710 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed.
L508709 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ You're not... seeing anybody?
L508708 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Me too.
L508707 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Well..  thanks.  I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes.  I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here.  I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.
L508706 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ No -- worried about you.  Personally.
L508705 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ You mean -- worried about my testimony?
L508704 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I've been worried about you.
L508703 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Really?  Lieutenant?
L508702 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
L508701 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I am?
L508700 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
L508699 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I know that.  This isn't about me.  It's about the choir.  You should hear them. They're good.  Really good.  And I taught them.
L508698 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity.
L508697 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I really can't talk about it now.  The place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show to do.
L508696 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You're supposed to be hiding out!
L508695 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
L508694 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
L508693 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!
L508506 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
L508505 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
L508504 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
L508503 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
L508502 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
L508501 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ What'd she say?
L508416 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll be in touch.
L508415 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Do you hear that?  That choir?  Eddie, in here, that's what they call music!
L508414 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ But it's a nightmare!  Mother Superior is out to get me!  She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!
L508413 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I just need a few more weeks,
L508412 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ You son-of-a-bitch!
L508411 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
L508410 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Like what?
L508409 +++$+++ u7629 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
L508408 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
