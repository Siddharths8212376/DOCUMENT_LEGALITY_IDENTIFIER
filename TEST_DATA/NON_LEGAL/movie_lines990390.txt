L576070 +++$+++ u8144 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ BIRDY +++$+++ But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm not interested in playing music professionally.
L576069 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
L576068 +++$+++ u8144 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ BIRDY +++$+++ It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
L576067 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Look, I'm no expert, but--
L576066 +++$+++ u8144 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ BIRDY +++$+++ But more or less.
L576065 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ He didn't say that.
L576064 +++$+++ u8144 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ BIRDY +++$+++ ...I stank, didn't I?
L576038 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Just see him, as a favor to me.
L576037 +++$+++ u8144 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ BIRDY +++$+++ Geez, Mr Crane.
L576036 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words.
L576035 +++$+++ u8144 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ BIRDY +++$+++ Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.
L576034 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand.
L576033 +++$+++ u8144 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ BIRDY +++$+++ Oh, Mr Crane--
L576032 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
L576031 +++$+++ u8144 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ BIRDY +++$+++ Boy.
L576030 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.
L576029 +++$+++ u8144 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ BIRDY +++$+++ Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
L576028 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.
L576027 +++$+++ u8144 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ BIRDY +++$+++ That's what he keeps telling me.
L576026 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Sure... Sure, it's his house.
L576023 +++$+++ u8144 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ BIRDY +++$+++ Pop doesn't like people smoking in here.
L576022 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...or maybe I just haven't played 'em right, I don't know. But you're--
L576021 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Birdy, I've been doing a lot of thinking. There are a lot of things that haven't worked out for me. Life has dealt me some bum cards...
L576020 +++$+++ u8144 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ BIRDY +++$+++ We've certainly missed you.
L576019 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah.
L576018 +++$+++ u8144 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ BIRDY +++$+++ We haven't seen you since... I'm terribly sorry.
L576017 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hello, Birdy.
L576016 +++$+++ u8144 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ BIRDY +++$+++ Hello, Mr Crane.
L575934 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hello, Tony.
L575933 +++$+++ u8144 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ BIRDY +++$+++ Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
L575932 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.
L575931 +++$+++ u8144 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ BIRDY +++$+++ Hi, Mr Crane.
L575923 +++$+++ u8144 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ BIRDY +++$+++ Beethoven. He created it, and yet he never actually heard it. I suppose he heard it all in his head, somehow.
L575922 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Who?
L575921 +++$+++ u8144 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ BIRDY +++$+++ He was deaf when he wrote this.
L575751 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah. Thanks.
L575750 +++$+++ u8144 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ BIRDY +++$+++ I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
L575749 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hello, Rachel.
L575592 +++$+++ u8144 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ BIRDY +++$+++ It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.
L575591 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...You don't like the music out there?
L576063 +++$+++ u8145 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CARCANOGUES +++$+++ Then you listen to me, for I am expert. That girl, she give me a headache. She cannot play. Nice girl. Very clever hands. Nice girl. Someday, I think, maybe, she make a very good typist.
L576062 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
L576061 +++$+++ u8145 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CARCANOGUES +++$+++ ...she can go up there.
L576058 +++$+++ u8145 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CARCANOGUES +++$+++ Ah, but that is just what I cannot teach. I cannot teach her to have a soul. Look, monsieur, play the piano, is not about the fingers. *Done* with the fingers, yes. But the music, she is inside. Inside, monsieur...
L576057 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
L576056 +++$+++ u8145 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CARCANOGUES +++$+++ Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.
L576055 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Did she make mistakes?
L576054 +++$+++ u8145 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CARCANOGUES +++$+++ Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
L576053 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I don't understand.
L576052 +++$+++ u8145 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CARCANOGUES +++$+++ Ze girl?... She seems like a very nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur, like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very nice girl. However, ztinks.
L576051 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well? How'd she do?
L576050 +++$+++ u8145 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CARCANOGUES +++$+++ ...Mm.
L576048 +++$+++ u8145 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CARCANOGUES +++$+++ Ah.
L576047 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
L576046 +++$+++ u8145 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CARCANOGUES +++$+++ Ah yes, a music lover.
L576045 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L576044 +++$+++ u8145 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CARCANOGUES +++$+++ I speak to you on ze phone, non? You have a special interest in music?
L576040 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No. Uh... family friend.
L576039 +++$+++ u8145 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CARCANOGUES +++$+++ ...You are ze fahzer?
L575629 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ OK.
L575628 +++$+++ u8146 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CREIGHTON +++$+++ And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--
L575627 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ All right.
L575626 +++$+++ u8146 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CREIGHTON +++$+++ *Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--
L575625 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...You're not gonna screw me on this?
L575624 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Look, uh... Creighton...
L575623 +++$+++ u8146 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CREIGHTON +++$+++ Well, there it is. Writ large in legal escriture, next step is--
L575622 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L575621 +++$+++ u8146 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CREIGHTON +++$+++ ...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.
L575620 +++$+++ u8146 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CREIGHTON +++$+++ Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh...
L575619 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ That'll be fine.
L575618 +++$+++ u8146 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CREIGHTON +++$+++ ...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh--
L575617 +++$+++ u8146 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CREIGHTON +++$+++ Yeah, screw 'em, huh? Pay 'em to tangle it up and then you pay 'em to untangle it, what's the point?
L575616 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It's OK.
L575615 +++$+++ u8146 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CREIGHTON +++$+++ Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer--
L575614 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah.
L575613 +++$+++ u8146 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CREIGHTON +++$+++ I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?
L575612 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Sure.
L575611 +++$+++ u8146 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CREIGHTON +++$+++ ...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?
L575610 +++$+++ u8146 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CREIGHTON +++$+++ Cash?!
L575609 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Cash.
L575608 +++$+++ u8146 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CREIGHTON +++$+++ ...You bring a check?
L575508 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah.
L575507 +++$+++ u8146 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CREIGHTON +++$+++ Right! Strictly business.
L575506 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Way out of line.
L575505 +++$+++ u8146 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CREIGHTON +++$+++ No problem!
L575504 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You're out of line, mister.
L575503 +++$+++ u8146 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CREIGHTON +++$+++ Maybe.
L575502 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...Was that a pass?
L575501 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Ed.
L575500 +++$+++ u8146 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CREIGHTON +++$+++ ...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. Here's to ya, uh...
L575499 +++$+++ u8146 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CREIGHTON +++$+++ Well, I'll be damned. The barber! And I thought this trip was a bust. Well...
L575498 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'll have it in a week.
L575497 +++$+++ u8146 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CREIGHTON +++$+++ Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
L575496 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ And how do we share--
L575495 +++$+++ u8146 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CREIGHTON +++$+++ Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
L575494 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?
L575493 +++$+++ u8146 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CREIGHTON +++$+++ Sure.
L575492 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No. I--tell me--
L575491 +++$+++ u8146 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CREIGHTON +++$+++ Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
L575490 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I can get it, yeah.
L575489 +++$+++ u8146 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CREIGHTON +++$+++ You got the dough?!
L575488 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No. I might be interested in that, uh, business proposition--
L575487 +++$+++ u8146 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CREIGHTON +++$+++ ...I didn't recognize you without the smock. Did I--damn--did I leave something at the shop?
L575486 +++$+++ u8146 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CREIGHTON +++$+++ Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Course--the barber.
L575485 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
L575484 +++$+++ u8146 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CREIGHTON +++$+++ Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
L575483 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?
L575469 +++$+++ u8146 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CREIGHTON +++$+++ That's right! Dry cleaning--remember the name. It's going to revolutionize the laundry industry, and those that get in early are gonna bear the fruit away. All I need is $10,000 to open my first store, then I use its cash flow to finance another, and so on-- leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole chain. Well, me and a partner. Cleanliness, friend. There's money in it. There's a future. There's room to grow... Say, that's looking pretty good. Let's see it with the hairpiece on...
L575468 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Huh.
L575467 +++$+++ u8146 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CREIGHTON +++$+++ It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
L575466 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ That right.
L575465 +++$+++ u8146 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CREIGHTON +++$+++ Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!
L575464 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Uh--
L575463 +++$+++ u8146 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ CREIGHTON +++$+++ A goose, friend. I was chasing a wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard of venture capital?
L575686 +++$+++ u8147 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ I'm not proud of what I did. But *you*.
L575685 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I, uh...
L575684 +++$+++ u8147 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.
L575683 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Big Dave--
L575682 +++$+++ u8147 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ What kind of man *are* you?
L575681 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...Huh?
L575680 +++$+++ u8147 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ ...What kind of man *are* you?
L575679 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So you paid the guy?
L575678 +++$+++ u8147 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ ...It ruined me. This money. No annex. I'm all shot to hell.
L575675 +++$+++ u8147 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Come on in.
L575674 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...Dave?
L575671 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ OK.
L575670 +++$+++ u8147 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
L575669 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Your place?
L575668 +++$+++ u8147 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Please, Ed.
L575667 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But it's...
L575666 +++$+++ u8147 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Please, Ed.
L575575 +++$+++ u8147 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Embezzling, Ed. From my own goddamn wife!
L575574 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Mm.
L575573 +++$+++ u8147 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
L575572 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
L575571 +++$+++ u8147 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ ...Oh, Jesus.
L575569 +++$+++ u8147 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ He's staying at the hotel I've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. Must've seen us.
L575568 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
L575567 +++$+++ u8147 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
L575566 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
L575565 +++$+++ u8147 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
L575564 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...You know... who *who* is?
L575563 +++$+++ u8147 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ $10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
L575562 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ How much to they want, Dave?
L575561 +++$+++ u8147 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus.
L575560 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L575559 +++$+++ u8147 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
L575558 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I guess it would be pretty awkward.
L575557 +++$+++ u8147 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Well, you know what that would do to me.
L575556 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L575555 +++$+++ u8147 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
L575554 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L575550 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What is it, Dave?
L575549 +++$+++ u8147 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ ...Ed, I...
L575428 +++$+++ u8147 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L575427 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Specialty store down in Sacramento.
L575426 +++$+++ u8147 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ ...Say, where do you get those things anyway?
L575425 +++$+++ u8147 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ ...Fine. Fine. Well, you might want to drop by the Annex when we open, update your suit--'course, you're in the smock all day.
L575424 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ All right, I guess.
L575423 +++$+++ u8147 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
L575422 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ How's business, Dave?
L575421 +++$+++ u8147 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ She's a rare one.
L575420 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Mm.
