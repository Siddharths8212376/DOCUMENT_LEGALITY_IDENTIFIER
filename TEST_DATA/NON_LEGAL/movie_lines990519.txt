L657410 +++$+++ u8936 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ TEEMO +++$+++ Elves!  They're always tormenting babies.  They make them cry and take their tears.
L657670 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Here.  Hold her.
L657669 +++$+++ u8935 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ SORSHA +++$+++ I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.

L657661 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.

L659271 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ You might want to pass it along to Mac.
L659270 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ Johnny –
L659269 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
L659268 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.
L659267 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ You made a mistake, Paul. You shouldn't have taken Elton out.
L658965 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Just us.
L658964 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ Who else knows?
L658963 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.
L658962 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ What's your first move?
L658961 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it.  I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you.
L658960 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
L658959 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
L658958 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Just us.
L658957 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ Who else knows?
L658956 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
L658955 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
L658954 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
L658849 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ Well, anyway, don't get crazy.  I'll do something for Zenovich's wife.

L658847 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde – what's-her-name – come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
L658846 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
L658845 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
L658844 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
L658843 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
L658842 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
L658841 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Maybe.
L658840 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ You know who?
L658839 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Maybe.
L658838 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ So one of them got to him.
L658837 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight – street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
L658836 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ What have you got?
L658835 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Yeah.
