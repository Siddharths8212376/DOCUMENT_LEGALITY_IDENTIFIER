L85925 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ No.
L85924 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ You don't want to talk about it.
L85923 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Shut up. I'm not listening.
L85922 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Why not?
L85921 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I don't want to talk about it.
L85918 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ No. But you tend to tie them up.
L85917 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
L85916 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
L85915 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Excuse me?
L85914 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ He will come back.
L85913 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
L85911 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ But, you know, so what?
L85910 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
L85909 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
L85908 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Oh Jesus.
L85907 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
L85906 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ So uh...
L85905 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Fine. Absolutely. Must be disappointing though. Must come as a hell of a shock.
L85904 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ It's none of your business.
L85903 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Fine.
L85902 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ I don't want to talk about him.
L85901 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
L85899 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ I said I don't have any.
L85898 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What?
L85897 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ I don't have any money.
L85896 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Give me some money.
L85894 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Yes.
L85893 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Shut up. Have you got your passport?
L85892 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ What?
L85891 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Have you got your passport?
L85890 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
L85878 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
L85877 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
L85876 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What? No you're not..
L85875 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
L85874 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What?
L85873 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Where's the restroom?
L85871 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to you, I'd like to give it a bash.
L85870 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
L85869 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ In every sense. If at all possible.
L85868 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ So you're just going to be vindictive
L85867 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I do. I want to very badly.
L85866 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ I know you just want to punish me --
L85865 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ In the world.
L85864 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ No I don't.
L85863 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.
L85856 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Well as it turns out I did.
L85855 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
L85854 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
L85853 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
L85852 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
L85851 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ So what are you going to do?
L85850 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy.
L85849 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
L85848 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I don't want to know.
L85847 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ It's makes it easier. Okay.
L85846 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
L85845 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously.
L85844 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ You don't understand anything.
L85843 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
L85722 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ They go.
L85721 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
L85720 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ They go.
L85719 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What's wrong?
L85718 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ They go. John. They go.
L85632 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yes I know.
L85631 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ "Frenzy".
L85616 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.
L85615 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Syevodnya
L85614 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Syevodnya?
L85612 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Happy bath day.
L85611 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I don't understand.
L85608 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Sorry?
L85607 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Today is bath day.
L85560 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Yes.
L85559 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Uh... Are you a giraffe?
L85558 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Yes.
L85557 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Do you follow or should I speak slower?
L85556 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Yes.
L85555 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Good. Or should I speak slower?
L85554 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Yes.
L85553 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
L85552 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Yes.
L85551 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?
L85550 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Yes.
L85549 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
L85548 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Yes.
L85547 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ So. Is it different to how you imagined it?
L85544 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I mean... "Ants." "I've got a problem with ants."
L85543 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Yes.
L85542 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
L85541 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Yes.
L85540 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
L85539 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Yes.
L85538 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"?
L85536 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Right. Okay. Good.
L85535 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Yes.
L85534 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Is that everything?
L86097 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Cash.
L86096 +++$+++ u503 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ How do you want to pay?
L86095 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Thanks.

L86093 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.
L86092 +++$+++ u503 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
L86091 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Is the flight full?

L86514 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
L86513 +++$+++ u505 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ANGELA +++$+++ You didn't have to do this.
L86512 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.
L86337 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Don't make it less true.
L86336 +++$+++ u505 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ANGELA +++$+++ I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
L86335 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Thank you.  Oh. My wife. She had a card here for her migraine pills. She ain't gonna be around no more... So if you...
L86334 +++$+++ u505 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ANGELA +++$+++ Not if no one finds out.
L86333 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ This gonna get you in trouble?
L86332 +++$+++ u505 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ANGELA +++$+++ My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box.
L86331 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Oh, she older than that.
L86330 +++$+++ u505 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ANGELA +++$+++ Is your niece older than 12?
L86326 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ No. No, she can't go. Mean to say... they's just no money fo'a doctor. Her daddy left for a job, and uh... give her to me to look on. I just...  I don't know what to do.
L86325 +++$+++ u505 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ANGELA +++$+++ You take her to a doctor?
L86324 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ My little niece... she got this deep cough.
L86323 +++$+++ u505 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ANGELA +++$+++ Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
L86322 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ I need to uh...
L86321 +++$+++ u505 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ANGELA +++$+++ Yes?
L86320 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Angela?
L86319 +++$+++ u505 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ANGELA +++$+++ Well. It's good to see you.
L86318 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
L86317 +++$+++ u505 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ANGELA +++$+++ I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
L86316 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ You hurt it?
L86315 +++$+++ u505 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ANGELA +++$+++ I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
L86314 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Oh! Gave me a start.
L86313 +++$+++ u505 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ANGELA +++$+++ Lazarus?
L86210 +++$+++ u513 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ MAYELLA +++$+++ Don't gotta tell me. Me and my girlfriends use-ta talk 'bout them hard fingertips he got pickin' that guitar.
L86209 +++$+++ u506 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ BOJO +++$+++ Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
L86208 +++$+++ u513 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ MAYELLA +++$+++ Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow?
L86205 +++$+++ u513 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ MAYELLA +++$+++ You seen my snake-skin shoes?
L86204 +++$+++ u506 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ BOJO +++$+++ Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.
L86203 +++$+++ u513 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ MAYELLA +++$+++ Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.
L86202 +++$+++ u506 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ BOJO +++$+++ He black alright, he just ain't blue.
L86271 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Okay.
L86270 +++$+++ u507 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Can I put it in your mouth?
L86269 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
L86268 +++$+++ u507 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ No, ma'am.
L86267 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ You ain't the kicker, are you?
L86266 +++$+++ u507 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Hey.
L86265 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Hi.
L86508 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ I'll take a jar of that, too.
L86507 +++$+++ u508 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ELLA MAE +++$+++ Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
L86506 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ For your hands?
L86505 +++$+++ u508 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ELLA MAE +++$+++ These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
L86504 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
L86502 +++$+++ u508 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ELLA MAE +++$+++ Well, that makes it easier.
L86501 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ That young lady's size, right'cher.
L86500 +++$+++ u508 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ELLA MAE +++$+++ And, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for?
L86669 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Make yourself at home. You done it already.
L86668 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ You gonna steal my truck?
L86666 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ The only thing that cunt's had behind her is me and half the town fuckin' her.  Your first night away, I come over and drop off the spare keys like you wanted me to. You weren't gone two hours and she was aching to get me inside her. Like she was havin' some kind'a fit.
L86665 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
