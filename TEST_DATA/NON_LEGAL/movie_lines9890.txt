L262648 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!
L262647 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ Like what?
L262645 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ When you leave the nest, I just want you to be ready to face the real world.
L262644 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not.
L262643 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
L262642 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I can't take this anymore.
L262641 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ You know, you've been very nervous lately.
L262635 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz.  More gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions.
L262634 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten.
L262501 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
L262500 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ What's the problem?
L262459 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh, Frederick!
L262458 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ I don't sell my work by the yard!
L262453 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ They're in the basement.
L262452 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.
L261989 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
L261988 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ ...or films you must see or... 
L261986 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Based on what?  You never even see him.
L261985 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ Elliot lusts after you.
L261984 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ Yeah.
L261983 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Me?
L261982 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ Because he likes you.
L261981 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Mmm  you never know.  They might.  He's just trying to do the nice thing.
L261978 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ Have I really taught you everything I have to give?  I don't think so.
L261977 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Mm-hm.
L261976 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ Well, there was a time  when you were very happy to be only with me.  You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music.
L261975 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ ...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else. 
L261974 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ Hmm?
L261973 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Mmm...
L261972 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ Isn't it enough that I can love you?
L261970 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with. 
L261969 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
L261968 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
L261967 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ God!  And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time.  I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.
L261966 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Mmm, what am I gonna do with you? 
L261965 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ Absolutely.
L261964 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Are you sure?
L261963 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ No, nothing.
L261962 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ How about something to eat?
L261961 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ No, thank you.
L261960 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Want some coffee or tea?
L262611 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.
L262610 +++$+++ u5745 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ GAIL +++$+++ Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?
L262609 +++$+++ u5745 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ GAIL +++$+++ Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap.
L262608 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Yes!
L262607 +++$+++ u5745 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ GAIL +++$+++ I know, I know, and your hamster.
L262606 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...you know it, it just takes the pleasure out of everything.  I mean, you're gonna die, I'm gonna die, the audience is gonna die, the network's gonna-- The sponsor. Everything!
L262605 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you?  That makes everything...
L262604 +++$+++ u5745 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ GAIL +++$+++ Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
L262603 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I went into a store, I bought a rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself.  The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath.
L262602 +++$+++ u5745 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ GAIL +++$+++ No.
L262601 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ A week ago, I bought a rifle.
L262600 +++$+++ u5745 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ GAIL +++$+++ Yes, please.
L262599 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
L262598 +++$+++ u5745 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ GAIL +++$+++ Yeah.  What?
L262596 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...
L262595 +++$+++ u5745 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ GAIL +++$+++ You're just realizing this now?
L262594 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ No, I'm not dying now, but, but  you know, when I ran out of the hospital, I, I was so thrilled because they told me I was going to be all right.  And I'm running down the street, and suddenly I stop, 'cause it hit me, all right, so, you know, I'm not going to go today. I'm okay.  I'm not going to go tomorrow.  But eventually, I'm going to be in that position.
L262593 +++$+++ u5745 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ GAIL +++$+++ Yeah...but you're not dying!
L262592 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Can you understand how meaningless everything is?  Everything!  I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless.
L262591 +++$+++ u5745 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ GAIL +++$+++ Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
L262590 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
L262168 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
L262167 +++$+++ u5745 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ GAIL +++$+++ Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
L262164 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I--How was I to know?!  Everyone was pointing back here.
L262163 +++$+++ u5745 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ GAIL +++$+++ It was on your shirt!
L262162 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
L262161 +++$+++ u5745 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ GAIL +++$+++ Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma.
L262160 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
L262159 +++$+++ u5745 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ GAIL +++$+++ But you don't have any symptoms!
L262158 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Don't say that!  I don't want to hear that word!  Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
L262157 +++$+++ u5745 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ GAIL +++$+++ I don't know.  Cancer, I--
L262156 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Like what?!  What?
L262155 +++$+++ u5745 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ GAIL +++$+++ Well, he has to rule out certain things. 
L262154 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ If there's nothing wrong with me  then why does he want me to come back for tests?!
L262153 +++$+++ u5745 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ GAIL +++$+++ But there's nothing wrong with you.
L262152 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I can't keep my mind on the show.
L262151 +++$+++ u5745 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ GAIL +++$+++ Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
L262150 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Oh, God!  Do you hear a buzzing?  Is there a buzzing?
L262149 +++$+++ u5745 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ GAIL +++$+++ But not you.
L262148 +++$+++ u5745 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ GAIL +++$+++ You don't have a brain tumor.  He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY  No, naturally  they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.
L262145 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Like-- 
L262144 +++$+++ u5745 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ GAIL +++$+++ Hello?
L262143 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ N-n-no, not that.
L262041 +++$+++ u5745 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ GAIL +++$+++ Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
L262040 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Oh, Jesus!
L262038 +++$+++ u5745 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ GAIL +++$+++ Yeah?
L262037 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Look at this guy.
L262034 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ No--
L262033 +++$+++ u5745 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ GAIL +++$+++ In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number?
L262032 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You know... 
L262031 +++$+++ u5745 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ GAIL +++$+++ Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
L263228 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Yeah.  I'll get some ice.
L263227 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
L263226 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote?  It was great. She's really developed.
L262981 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I think we need to eat.
L262980 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Yeah?
L262979 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache.
L262978 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ What's the matter?  What's the matter with you?  You look pale.  You okay?
L262969 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ She's going through a really rough time right now.
L262968 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Oh, now-- 
L262967 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
L262955 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ You are, Holly.  Stop it.
L262954 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
L262919 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
L262918 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
L262917 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Like what?
L262916 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
L262915 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh...
L262914 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
L262913 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Really?
L262912 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
L262911 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Y-yeah.
L262910 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
L262909 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ I'm okay.
L262908 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ How are you?
L262907 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
L262906 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ No.
L262905 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Do you miss Frederick?
L262904 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh, me, I'm okay.
L262903 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ So how are you?
L262902 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.
L262901 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ ...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
L262900 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Why?
L262899 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ I hope you tell her it was your idea...
L262897 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Oh, yeah?  How's she doing?
L262896 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
L262895 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Hi.  Where's Holly?
L261926 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test. 
L261925 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Oh, yeah?
L261922 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I bumped into your...
L261921 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Doesn't she look pretty?
L261920 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Come on.
L261919 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ You look so beautiful.
L261918 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh, great.
L261859 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Okay.
L261858 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere.
L261837 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ You've outdone yourself.
L261836 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I think they're fantastic.
L261835 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?
L262421 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Right.  We felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and...
L262420 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor.  I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that.
L262418 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
L262417 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--  It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
L262398 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Just think about it.  That's all I ask.
L262397 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ With a, with a stranger?  With a--
L262396 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ I want to experience childbirth.
L262395 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
L262394 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
L262393 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What, by a st-stranger?
L262392 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
L262391 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L262390 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Well, what about artificial insemination?
L262389 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one--
L262388 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Hey, you gonna start knocking my hobbies?  Jesus!
L262387 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
L262386 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
L262385 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
L262384 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I'm so humiliated.  I don't know what to say.  I mean--
L262381 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Well, then a third opinion.
L262380 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ This is the second opinion.
L262375 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Is there no chance?
L262374 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Gee.

L262084 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Mh-hm.
L262083 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Thanks, thanks.
L262082 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You've always had good taste in husbands, so...
L262081 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ You know, he's been wanting a mitt.
