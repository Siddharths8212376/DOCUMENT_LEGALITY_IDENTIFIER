L383020 +++$+++ u6585 +++$+++ m438 +++$+++ O'DANIEL +++$+++ I'm lonesome. I'm lonesome so I'm a drunk. I'm lonesome so I'm a dope fiend. I'm lonesome so I'm a thief, a fornicator, a whore-monger. Poop, I say, poop! I've heard it all and I'm sick of it, sick to death.
L383019 +++$+++ u6583 +++$+++ m438 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Well, not too, I mean, a little.

L383458 +++$+++ u6601 +++$+++ m439 +++$+++ TEX +++$+++ Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
