L306759 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
L306758 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
L306757 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Friends?
L306756 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Thank you for the coffee. It's very robust.
L306755 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No.
L306754 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
L306753 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
L306752 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
L306751 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No, we're not!
L306750 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ We're damaged goods.
L306749 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Oh right. You met Patricia.
L306748 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Your mother was.
L306747 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ And here I thought my mother was...
L306746 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Boy. Boy, oh boy.
L306745 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Apparently she was very disappointed.
L306744 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ She held that against you?
L306743 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
L306742 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ She didn't love you?
L306741 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ She never particularly cared for me.
L306740 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
L306739 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Hmmm...
L306738 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ You look like you were a very sensitive child. You have expressive eyes.
L306737 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
L306736 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Oh. And that is -- mom?
L306735 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Me. Yes.
L306734 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Is that you?
L306733 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans.
L306732 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
L306731 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
L306730 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ From a -- girlfriend.
L306729 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
L306728 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
L306727 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Thank you.
L306726 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.
L306724 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Okay Miles.
L306723 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No. Don't stop.
L306722 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
L306721 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
L306720 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
L306719 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
L306718 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
L306717 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
L306716 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Screw you, asswipe!
L306715 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
L306714 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Marylin? When did I say...?
L306713 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
L306712 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yes? Marylin?
L306711 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Miles?
L306710 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Hello?
L306697 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ You really think I engineered the whole thing. You think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme. You came here to celebrate because you think I'm without morality or soul. You --  sound like my mother.
L306696 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
L306695 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
L306694 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
L306693 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
L306692 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ To victory.
L306664 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
L306663 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
L306662 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I figure a couple of months. That's how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry.
L306661 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Have you tried the duck?
L306660 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
L306659 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
L306658 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.
L306657 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Miles. Miles. Miles.
L306656 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
L306655 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Howard is a beautiful person.
L306654 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I'd like to offer my congratulations. That was a beautiful gesture of Howard's.
L306607 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No, that's not all.
L306606 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ So I hear. Is that all?
L306605 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
L306604 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ We told you. We realized we've always been in love.
L306603 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ But why him?
L306602 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
L306601 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Marylin! Listen to me.
L306600 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
L306599 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
L306598 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ He's passionate.
L306597 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ To him? He's a sick freak.
L306596 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Getting married.
L306588 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Absolutely.
L306587 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ -- we are both sure that's what we want?
L306579 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ That is correct. Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law.
L306578 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
L306577 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Oh, for the love of...
L306470 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
L306469 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ He'll regret this.
L306445 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
L306444 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
L306442 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ And you've always loved him?
L306441 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
L306419 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Well, don't look at mine!
L306418 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
L306417 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ What is it you're after, Miles?
L306416 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Gotcha.
L306415 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
L306414 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ He wants a reconciliation.
L306413 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?
L306412 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No. I haven't. Have you?
L306411 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ You just haven't met the right person.
L306410 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
L306409 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ You don't believe in it.
L306408 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No.
L306407 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Have you ever been married, Miles?
L306406 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
L306405 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.
L306404 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ "Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"
L306402 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I know you do.
L306401 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same?  I assume you're a carnivore.
L306400 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I told you. I was hungry.
L306399 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Why would you be here?
L306398 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ How do you know?
L306397 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ But you don't agree?
L306396 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
L306395 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What does your lawyer think?
L306394 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon?
L306393 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ See the tape. Then we can discuss my heart.
L306392 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Not yet.
L306391 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Did you see the tape?
L306390 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
L306388 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ "Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery."
L306387 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared.
L306386 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Isn't everything?
L306385 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I assume this is on Rex?
L306340 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
L306339 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ These are yours.
L306317 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
L306316 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ How nice.
L306304 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ And you must be Mr. Massey.
L306303 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ -- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
L306342 +++$+++ u1523 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ REX +++$+++ Sometimes I forget.
L306341 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
L306338 +++$+++ u1523 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ REX +++$+++ You have some?
L306337 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Do you need a Tagamet?
L306308 +++$+++ u1523 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ REX +++$+++ My whole metabolism is -- off.
L306307 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Are you alright? You lost weight.
L306306 +++$+++ u1523 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ REX +++$+++ Marylin.
L306305 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Hello, Rex.
L306201 +++$+++ u1523 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ REX +++$+++ Dogs?
L306200 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
L306199 +++$+++ u1523 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ REX +++$+++ Marylin?
L306198 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
L306197 +++$+++ u1523 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ REX +++$+++ But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
L306196 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ We are. And it's winding down.
L306195 +++$+++ u1523 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ REX +++$+++ Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
L306194 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Rex. Get away from the door.
L306970 +++$+++ u1524 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a deal or find out how Jean Harris made it work for her.
L306969 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ So. Now what?
L306968 +++$+++ u1524 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ He was right, wasn't he?
L306967 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ He never even asked. He just assumed --
L306966 +++$+++ u1524 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Like I know his intention? Or yours for that matter?  I should join Sam. I'm too old for this bullshit.
L306965 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
L306964 +++$+++ u1524 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
L306963 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
L306962 +++$+++ u1524 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ You used his credit card.
L306961 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Forgery and Fraud?
L306462 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Please!
L306461 +++$+++ u1524 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Is this a lover?
L306454 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Jesus.
L306453 +++$+++ u1524 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Who's that?
L306429 +++$+++ u1524 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
L306428 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I was devastated. Of course.
L306344 +++$+++ u1524 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
L306343 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I'm sorry. Where were we?
L306899 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I guess.
L306898 +++$+++ u1525 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Soon, you'll have your own rage!
L306897 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
L306896 +++$+++ u1525 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Well, that's about to change big time.
L306895 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
L306894 +++$+++ u1525 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ So what?
L306893 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.
L306892 +++$+++ u1525 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ But you're going through with it?
L306891 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
L306890 +++$+++ u1525 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ What?
L306884 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Right.
L306883 +++$+++ u1525 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
L306882 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
L306877 +++$+++ u1525 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ It's not Ming. It's Tong.
L306876 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Is this Ming?
L306836 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I want to be exposed.
L306835 +++$+++ u1525 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.
L306802 +++$+++ u1525 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Hello Miles.
L306801 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
L306499 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
L306498 +++$+++ u1525 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ You're not...
L306495 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Probably. Every woman in my life was divorced at least twice. What was I supposed to say. Anthropologist?
L306494 +++$+++ u1525 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
L306493 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
L306490 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
L306489 +++$+++ u1525 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
L306374 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Get this! He called and invited me to dinner.
L306373 +++$+++ u1525 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Shit.
L306372 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
L306371 +++$+++ u1525 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ So where are you now?
L306370 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
L306369 +++$+++ u1525 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I'm dying.
L306368 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Every week --
L306367 +++$+++ u1525 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Oh, God!
L306366 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Lilly's up.
L306365 +++$+++ u1525 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ He has a reputation for being tough.
L306364 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
L306363 +++$+++ u1525 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Well what does he want?
