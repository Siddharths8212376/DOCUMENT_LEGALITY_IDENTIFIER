L236536 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
L236535 +++$+++ u1100 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Aren't there a million places like this?
L236527 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you.
L236526 +++$+++ u1100 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes.
L236523 +++$+++ u1100 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ No.
L236522 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
L236521 +++$+++ u1100 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
L236520 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ That guy rules!
L236517 +++$+++ u1100 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Look, can we talk in a minute? I'm almost done.
L236516 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ So Josh...
L236508 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I'm afraid I don't understand. I simply wish to know --
L236507 +++$+++ u1100 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
L236506 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
L236505 +++$+++ u1100 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
L236504 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
L237563 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ It just came yesterday...
L237562 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Wow... finally.
L237560 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Maybe an orange juice.
L237559 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Do you want anything?
L237558 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Actually, he's a really nice guy.
L237557 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
L237556 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
L237555 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Hi.
L237506 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!
L237505 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I dunno...
L237504 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ What time?
L237503 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
L237502 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ That's all you're bringing?
L237501 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ There.
L237500 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ So where's all your stuff?
L237499 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ It's fine.
L237498 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ So, whaddya think?
L237471 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise. If I don't, you can totally tell me to fuck off.
L237470 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
L237469 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
L237468 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
L237467 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Please let me come with you. Please please please...
L237466 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
L237465 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
L237464 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I need to talk to you.
L237463 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Hello?
L237355 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life!
L237354 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
L237353 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!
L237352 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it.
L237351 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
L237350 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
L237349 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
L237348 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I said "great"...
L237347 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
L237346 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Great...
L237345 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it?  That must be it...
L237344 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
L237343 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ When was this?
L237342 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Nothing.
L237341 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Why? What did he say?
L237340 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ He came into work.
L237339 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What? When did you see Josh?!
L237338 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
L237337 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
L237336 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
L237335 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood...
L237228 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Yeah well, you said you were busy... look, I'd better get going... I'll call you tomorrow.
L237227 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I don't believe you.
L237226 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Just some people from work...
L237225 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What are you talking about? Who?
L237224 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
L237223 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ So should I come over?
L237222 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ How repulsive!
L237221 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I can't believe it - he actually scored!
L237220 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ What happened to Seymour?
L237219 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Do you still want to do something tonight?
L237218 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Hello?
L237193 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ God, I'm so sick of Seymour.
L237192 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
L237191 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
L237190 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What thing?
L237189 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
L237188 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ You're insane.
L237187 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
L237186 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I can't imagine spending money on towels.
L237185 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Don't you want nice stuff?
L237184 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
L237183 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?
L237182 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I can't afford stuff like this right now.
L237181 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Look, we have to get these...
L237180 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.
L237179 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
L237178 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
L237177 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
L237176 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ God, you're really obsessed...
L237175 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ No, really...
L237174 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Go ahead...
L237173 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I think one of us should fuck Josh...
L237110 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Yeah, I guess... call me...
L237109 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
L237108 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...
L237107 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Do you want to do something tonight?
L237106 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Yeah, thanks.
L237105 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
L237104 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Don't worry.
L237103 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Now are you going to get a regular job?
L237089 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.
L237088 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ What was that all about? I thought everything must go!
L237083 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Oh my god, I remember this hat... this was during your little old lady phase...
L237082 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Fuck it. Everything must go!
L237081 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.
L237079 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...
L237078 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!
L237055 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ We were such desperate sluts back then.
L237054 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
L237053 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
L237052 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
L237051 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Wasn't it like eighth grade?
L237050 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
L237049 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I dunno, but next week is my last class...
L237048 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ When are you finally going to get your diploma?
L237047 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
L237046 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job...
L236950 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Get away from me!
L236949 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ ...maybe we should be lesbos...
L236948 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
L236947 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
L236946 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
L236945 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
L236944 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ You're just jealous.
L236933 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
L236932 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ He gives me a total boner!
L236931 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Which one?
L236930 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ You're gross.  See that guy?
L236929 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
L236928 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
L236927 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
L236926 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ ...you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment.
L236906 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.
L236905 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
L236904 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Like what?
L236903 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
L236902 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?
L236901 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ But those are our people...
L236900 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
L236899 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ That rules!
L236898 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
L236897 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
L236896 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
L236895 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ God, how can you stand all these assholes?
L236891 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ He does that every single day.
L236890 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ That guy is totally amazing.
L236886 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ You cunt!
L236885 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Just now... I went with Seymour.
L236884 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ No way... when?
L236883 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Anthony's II!
L236882 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Where?
L236881 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ You won't believe it! Guess!
L236880 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Where did you get that?
L236879 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Give me all your money, bitch!
L236797 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Wait...
L236796 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer.
L236784 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
L236783 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I totally, totally hate you.
L236777 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ If I promise you there's really a party with a lot of guys, do you promise you'll go?
L236776 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I don't believe you.
L236775 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ It's a surprise.
L236774 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ What? Where?!
L236773 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I know a party we could go to...
L236772 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
L236771 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick.
L236768 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.
L236767 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ How about this?
L236766 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ God, aren't you tired of Seymour yet?
L236765 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
L236764 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Ew ... when did you get that?
L236763 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
L236762 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ How about this one?
L236721 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Everybody's too stupid!
L236720 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I didn't get it either.
L236719 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
L236718 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ What was that all about?
L236700 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ It'll only take a second.
L236699 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Why are we going here? I hate this place.
