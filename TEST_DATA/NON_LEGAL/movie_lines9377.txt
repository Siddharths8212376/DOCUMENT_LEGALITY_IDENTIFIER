L505800 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Don't.
L505799 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ Graham.
L505796 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ Graham.
L505795 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Don't touch him.
L505731 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Me too.
L505730 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ That's good enough for me.
L505728 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ I know.  We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
L505727 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
L505726 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared, but who knows for sure?
L505725 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Have they said anything about our area?
L505724 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
L505722 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ Listen, there's things I can take and a couple things I can't and one of them I can't take, is when my older brother --  -- who is everything I want to be, starts losing faith in things. I saw your eyes last night.  I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? I'm serious.
L505721 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No.
L505719 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now.  They're leaving. Beat.
L505718 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ How do they know it's over?
L505717 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.
L505716 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ How many died?
L505714 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up.  We won Graham.
L505713 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ They're broadcasting...
L505676 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ I'm close.
L505675 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ It's getting stronger.
L505674 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ Me too.
L505673 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I can feel air.
L505664 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ From what?
L505663 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ They're distracting us?
L505646 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ Got it!
L505645 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Merrill!
L505643 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ I'm looking!
L505642 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Merrill --
L505633 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
L505632 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ We won't be able to get out of there.
L505625 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ He was trying to eat a second chocolate bar. Your grandma said, "No." He tried to take a bite, so I grabbed it.
L505624 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ What are you doing?
L505623 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ He was only a year and half old.
L505622 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ They're right behind the door.
L505621 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ Should we make a run for it out the back?
L505620 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?
L505618 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ We have to go in the basement.
L505617 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ This is going to do nothing.
L505608 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you.
L505607 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ They're on the roof.
L505600 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ They already know we're here.
L505599 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ Should we turn off the lights?
L505578 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
L505577 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ Chicken Teriyaki.
L505532 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
L505531 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ I'm sorry, what book is this?
L505469 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Ray Reddy's house.
L505468 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ Where are you going?
L505438 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ Already thought of. Two other birds did the same thing an hour later. Not as dramatic. They lived. But you could see they hit something.
L505437 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
L505436 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.
L505433 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ Eleven a.m. They're gone.
L505432 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ What time is it?
L505431 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.
L505430 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ What's furry, furry rabbit?
L505429 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
L505423 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ What does it matter then?
L505422 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ Yes.
L505421 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Do you feel comforted?
L505415 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be? Give me some comfort?
L505414 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ That wasn't the answer you wanted?
L505413 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ How can you say that?
L505412 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes.
L505411 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ Do you think it's a possibility?
L505367 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ I got him.
L505366 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Morgan, be careful.
L505352 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ That's right.
L505351 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ It's probably picking up another baby monitor.
L505339 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay?
L505338 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ It's noise.
L505326 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?
L505325 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ Pharmacy crowded?
L505230 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high.
L505229 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ That roof is over ten feet high.
L505228 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?
L505227 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ This guy got on the roof in like a second.
L505211 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes, it was.
L505210 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ It was very dark.
L505201 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes it was.
L505200 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ It was very dark.
L505198 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ I heard.
L505197 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I cursed.
L505190 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ You want him coming in the house next time?
L505189 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No I'm not.
L505188 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ Are you going to do this or what?
L505187 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Explain noises.
L505186 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ Just make noises then.
L505185 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
L505184 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ You don't mean it. It's just for show.
L505183 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I'm not going to curse.
L505182 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ Curse and stuff.
L505181 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Explain, act crazy?
L505179 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
L505178 +++$+++ u2747 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MERRILL +++$+++ Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!
L505803 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yeah baby. I think someone did.
L505802 +++$+++ u2748 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ Did someone save me?
L505658 +++$+++ u2748 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
L505657 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I can't even imagine.
L505640 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ You're scaring your sister.
L505639 +++$+++ u2748 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ They'll read our minds!
L505584 +++$+++ u2748 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ Don't yell at her!
L505583 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Stop crying!
L505576 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
L505575 +++$+++ u2748 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ French toast... and mashed potatoes.
L505568 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner.
L505567 +++$+++ u2748 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ What about Isabelle?
L505566 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ The family room.
L505565 +++$+++ u2748 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ Where are we going to sleep?
L505564 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
L505537 +++$+++ u2748 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ Sounds made up.
L505536 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ What do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water, and we might be safe from them near a lake or something?
L505535 +++$+++ u2748 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ They win.
L505534 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ What's two?
L505533 +++$+++ u2748 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ They said one of two things could happen. One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.
L505530 +++$+++ u2748 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.
L505529 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
L505455 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I just asked his name.
L505454 +++$+++ u2748 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ Dad.
L505453 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Bimboo?
L505452 +++$+++ u2748 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of the book --
L505447 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ That means they're unemployed.
L505446 +++$+++ u2748 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
L505445 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Who wrote this book?
L505444 +++$+++ u2748 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
L505443 +++$+++ u2748 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ They tell you everything in this book.
L505442 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Oh.
L505441 +++$+++ u2748 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ So the aliens can't read our minds.
L505365 +++$+++ u2748 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ It gets clearer, the higher you hold it.
L505364 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Morgan?
L505344 +++$+++ u2748 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ Don't do it.
L505343 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I'm getting out now.
L505341 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this.
L505340 +++$+++ u2748 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ We might lose the signal.
L505252 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ It's old Morgan.
L505251 +++$+++ u2748 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ It's still making the noises. It's broken.
L505225 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I have some upstairs.
L505224 +++$+++ u2748 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ These are D's; I need double A's.
L505220 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Edgar, come inside.
L505219 +++$+++ u2748 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ It needs batteries.
L505218 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes.
L505217 +++$+++ u2748 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
L505759 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ What did you say?
L505758 +++$+++ u2749 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ OFFICER PASKI +++$+++ The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
L505757 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Pinned? What does that mean?
L505756 +++$+++ u2749 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ OFFICER PASKI +++$+++ See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
L505755 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Why not?
L505754 +++$+++ u2749 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ OFFICER PASKI +++$+++ She's not in an ambulance Father.
L505752 +++$+++ u2749 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ OFFICER PASKI +++$+++ Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.
L505751 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Is he okay?
L505750 +++$+++ u2749 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ OFFICER PASKI +++$+++ He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
L505749 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
L505273 +++$+++ u2749 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ OFFICER PASKI +++$+++ You take care of yourself...  Graham.
L505272 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
L505271 +++$+++ u2749 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ OFFICER PASKI +++$+++ It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
L505270 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ And three weeks.
L505269 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Six months.
L505268 +++$+++ u2749 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ OFFICER PASKI +++$+++ But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.
L505250 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No.
L505249 +++$+++ u2749 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ OFFICER PASKI +++$+++ Is anything missing?
L505247 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No.
L505246 +++$+++ u2749 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ OFFICER PASKI +++$+++ Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
L505245 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I don't think so.
L505215 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement.  But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously, just in case, it is something serious.
L505214 +++$+++ u2749 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ OFFICER PASKI +++$+++ Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.
L505207 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I would say so.
L505206 +++$+++ u2749 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ OFFICER PASKI +++$+++ Okay.  So he was tall?
L505205 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ He definitely wasn't a midget.
L505204 +++$+++ u2749 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ OFFICER PASKI +++$+++ I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
L505203 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
L505202 +++$+++ u2749 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ OFFICER PASKI +++$+++ You can't describe him at all? Don't you think that's find of odd?
L505151 +++$+++ u2749 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ OFFICER PASKI +++$+++ No Father, they're edgy. On alert. Like they act when they smell a predator around... Peeing on themselves and everything.
L505150 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Sounds like a virus.
L505149 +++$+++ u2749 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ OFFICER PASKI +++$+++ Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
L505148 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ What was the first thing?
L505147 +++$+++ u2749 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ OFFICER PASKI +++$+++ Second thing this week I can't explain.
L505144 +++$+++ u2749 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ OFFICER PASKI +++$+++ What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
L505143 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ It's not broken.
L505141 +++$+++ u2749 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ OFFICER PASKI +++$+++ There are none.
L505140 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ What about them?
L505139 +++$+++ u2749 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ OFFICER PASKI +++$+++ The footprints.
L505138 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ You said something was strange. What's strange?
L505137 +++$+++ u2749 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ OFFICER PASKI +++$+++ Sorry.
L505136 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
L505135 +++$+++ u2749 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ OFFICER PASKI +++$+++ What's that?
L505134 +++$+++ u2746 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Don't call me Father.
L505133 +++$+++ u2749 +++$+++ m179 +++$+++ OFFICER PASKI +++$+++ It's the strangest thing Father.
