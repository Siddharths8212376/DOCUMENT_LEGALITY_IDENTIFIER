L600097 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You can't be serious.
L600096 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ You want her dead, don't you?
L600095 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ No.
L600094 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ She's blackmailing you, right?
L600093 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ No.
L600092 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you to level with me: Did you knock this skirt up?
L600091 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You don't buy what?
L600090 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ I don't buy it.
L600089 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
L600088 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Don't play games with me, Ted.
L600087 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Well, I know you're busy...
L600086 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ All you want is a phone number?
L600085 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
L600084 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Any idea where I might start looking?
L600083 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L600082 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ So, Dom tells me you're looking for some lady-friend you knew in high school.
L600899 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it?
L600898 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Oh... Sully.
L600894 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ Don't flatter yourself -- I was following her, I always do. How the hell you think I got rid of Mary's boyfriend Steve?
L600893 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ You were following us?
L600892 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
L600891 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
L600890 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.
L600888 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ You fucking prick, we had a deal -- you said you wouldn't fuck me and I wouldn't fuck you until we had this fuck out of the fucking picture.  You crossed the line, man.
L600887 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ What?
L600886 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ You little fuck.
L600860 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Sully...! What the fuck happened here?!
L600859 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
L600858 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Ho-ly shit.
L600818 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ I never said that.
L600817 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
L600816 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ Four.
L600815 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ How many is that?
L600814 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Fucking sickening.
L600813 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch!
L600784 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ Why you son of a --
L600783 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
L600782 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
L600781 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line!
L600780 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
L600779 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Nice.
L600778 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ Friend. Baseball bat.
L600777 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ How'd you manage that one?
L600776 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
L600775 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ And you met Mary how?
L600774 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ ...So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked up with the Pizza Barn.
L600766 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Bullshit!
L600765 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else.  My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.
L600764 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ But... but you knew people at Harvard.
L600763 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
L600762 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ What do you mean?
L600761 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ I'm a phony -- just like you, man.
L600760 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.
L600759 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ You what?
L600756 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ Who?
L600755 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're working for him, aren't you, you little shit?
L600752 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Maybe this'll jog your memory.
L600751 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.
L600750 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?!
L600749 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.
L600436 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
L600435 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ You know, I really should take your card.
L600434 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Uh, sort of nouveau Deco... with a big vestibule. Check it out next time you're up there.
L600433 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
L600432 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
L600431 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
L600430 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Do you know the... soccer stadium?
L600429 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
L600428 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
L600425 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Nice smokescreen, isn't it?
L600424 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.
L600422 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ You mean him.
L600421 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
L600420 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ Kim and I are close friends!
L600419 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Among others.
L600418 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ Did you study under Kim Greene?
L600417 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ You bet.
L600416 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ Harvard?
L600415 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
L600414 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
L600413 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Mainly I work out of Boston.
L600410 +++$+++ u3273 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HEALY +++$+++ Same here.
L600409 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
L600460 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Huh. That sounds great.  Unless someone else comes out with Six-Minute Abs.
L600459 +++$+++ u3274 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HITCHHIKER +++$+++ Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
L600458 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ How do you guarantee that?
L600457 +++$+++ u3274 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HITCHHIKER +++$+++ Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
L600456 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'd go with the seven.
L600455 +++$+++ u3274 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HITCHHIKER +++$+++ Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
L600454 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I see where you're going.
L600453 +++$+++ u3274 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HITCHHIKER +++$+++ Two million copies it sold last year. Two million, man. But not next year -- my idea's gonna blow them outta the water. Get this:  Seven-Minute Abs.
L600452 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
L600451 +++$+++ u3274 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HITCHHIKER +++$+++ Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?
L600450 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ 'That right? Good for you.
L600449 +++$+++ u3274 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HITCHHIKER +++$+++ A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
L600448 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Hm?
L600447 +++$+++ u3274 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HITCHHIKER +++$+++ Oh. Well I am.
L600446 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
L600445 +++$+++ u3274 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HITCHHIKER +++$+++ Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
L600444 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That must make it tough.
L600443 +++$+++ u3274 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HITCHHIKER +++$+++ I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
L600442 +++$+++ u3283 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
L600441 +++$+++ u3274 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ HITCHHIKER +++$+++ Thanks for picking me up.
L600194 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life.  Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.
L600193 +++$+++ u3275 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ JOANIE +++$+++ What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.
L600190 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Ah, she's okay.
L600189 +++$+++ u3275 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ JOANIE +++$+++ Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
L600188 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I don't know, it was complicated. He's in San Francisco, I'm in Miami.  Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.
L600186 +++$+++ u3275 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ JOANIE +++$+++ All right for awhile? The guy's good- looking, rich, witty. He was a god.
L600185 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
L600184 +++$+++ u3275 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ JOANIE +++$+++ Oh come off it, Mare. What about what's-his-name... Steverino? You could've at least passed the baton on that one.
L600183 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No I'm not.
L600182 +++$+++ u3275 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ JOANIE +++$+++ It means you're too hard on guys.
L600181 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What's that supposed to mean?
L600180 +++$+++ u3275 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ JOANIE +++$+++ Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.
L600173 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed.
L600172 +++$+++ u3275 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ JOANIE +++$+++ Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
L600171 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
L600170 +++$+++ u3275 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ JOANIE +++$+++ I can live with those reflections.
L600166 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
L600165 +++$+++ u3275 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ JOANIE +++$+++ No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'
L600832 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ Ah, he was being a pest so I put him in the bathroom.
L600831 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Where's Puffy?
L600830 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.
L600703 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ The little shit lied to me about that guy!
L600702 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Magda!
L600701 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ Puffy, get over here.
L600700 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Holy shit...
L600684 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday.  I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.
L600683 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?
L600675 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.
L600674 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ An old flame?
L600672 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ Oh no? I ain't seen you beaming like this since you broke ninety on the Blue Monster.
L600671 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
L600670 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
L600669 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
L600668 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker.
L600667 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.
L600666 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
L600665 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Why?
L600664 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ I'm buying bananas tonight.
L600581 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Healy.
L600580 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
L600387 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.
L600386 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ Bundt cake?
L600381 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
L600380 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
L600371 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ Fuck kindred spirits. My little Puffy here's gonna tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat. If he starts yapping, he's a loser; if Puffy's relaxed... well, you got yourself a keeper.
L600370 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ The point is, love isn't about money or social standing or age, it's about connecting with someone, having things in common kindred spirits.
L600369 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ That's exactly why I don't watch 'em anymore -- it's bullshit! Why the hell would an old lady go for a young kid?
L600368 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
L600367 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ I don't watch the new ones.
L600366 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
L600365 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
L600364 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
L600363 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ What's a mook?
L600362 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
L600361 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ What's he like?
L600360 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ He's no Steve Young.
L600359 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ Good lookin'?
L600358 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
L600357 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ So who's the lucky guy?
L600205 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No time, Magda, my show's starting.
L600204 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ Jesus, Mary, you gotta hear this -- some cop's staking out this broad's apartment.
L600150 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Okay, you win. Now try to get some sleep, huh.
L600149 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
L600148 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
L600147 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people.
L600146 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
L600145 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
L600144 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Meaning?
L600143 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
L600142 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
L600141 +++$+++ u3276 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MAGDA +++$+++ Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
L600140 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Have you been up all night again?
L600946 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Oh Jesus...
L600945 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.
L600942 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You mean he's not a criminal?
L600941 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ Uh, well... not exactly. You see, I exaggerated a little there.
L600709 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to do. I'll call him right now.
L600708 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
L600707 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
L600705 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
L600704 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
L600699 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ I've got a friend in the Boston police department. He faxed me this this morning. I'll just give you the highlights.  After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him. In his mid- twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington. Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him, and on and on and so forth and so on.
L600698 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What...?
L600697 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ Mary, the man's a killer.
L600696 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
L600695 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ I think you'd better sit down.
L600693 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.
L600692 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What's up?
L600691 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ Thanks, but I've got to be going. Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social visit.
L600690 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Can I pour you one?
L600549 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I appreciate you looking out for me.
L600548 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
L600547 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No no no, Tucker, thank you.
L600546 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
L600543 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some friends back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.
L600542 +++$+++ u3277 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
L600541 +++$+++ u3284 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ TUCKER +++$+++ That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
