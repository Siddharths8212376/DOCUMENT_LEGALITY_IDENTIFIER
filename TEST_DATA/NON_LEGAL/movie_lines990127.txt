L387468 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan.
L387467 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Misery?
L387466 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I thought it was time you two should meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow, Misery.
L387465 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ My pleasure.
L387464 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Thank you so much.
L387463 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You'd be amazed at what some people will believe.
L387462 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
L387461 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
L387460 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
L387457 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I can live with "great."
L387456 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
L387455 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I guess that means it's okay.
L387454 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I made you my speciality--scrambled eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page 75.
L387452 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Your agent said she would tell her you were okay. But I'm afraid you'll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself.
L387451 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
L387450 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ ...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
L387449 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ My daughter must be going nuts.
L387448 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...
L387447 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ The phones are working?
L387446 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.
L387445 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Then the roads are open...
L387444 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ They had it at the store, Paul, there was a whole batch of them there. As soon as I saw it, I slammed my money down. I got the first copy.
L387443 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's fine.
L387442 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
L387424 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Well, these are slum kids, I was a slum kid, everybody talks like that.
L387423 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It has no nobility.
L387422 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ The profanity bothers you?
L387421 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
L387420 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Pretty rough so far.
L387419 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.
L387418 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I can take it, go ahead.
L387417 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
L387416 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No, what is it?
L387415 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Nothing.
L387414 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ But what?
L387404 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, like I could do that?
L387403 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
L387402 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What's it about?
L387401 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't have a title yet.
L387400 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What's your new book called?
L387398 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me.
L387397 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
L387396 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ If you wouldn't mind.
L387395 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You want to read it?
L387394 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It shouldn't be too much longer.  Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you.  Could I ask you a favor?  I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and...  and I wondered if maybe... 
L387393 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ When do you think the phone lines'll be back up? I have to call my daughter, and I should call New York and let my agent know I'm breathing.
L387392 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain.  Like a baby.  All done. 
L387391 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You're very kind...
L387389 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Lucky for you, I did.  Lucky for me too. Because now you're alive and you can write more books. Oh, Paul, I've read everything of Yours, but the Misery novels...
L387388 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
L387387 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
L387386 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
L387385 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin--  and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer.
L387384 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Following me?
L387383 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you.
L387355 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Of course you will. And your arm will be fine, too. Your shoulder was dislocated pretty badly, but I finally popped it back in there.  But what I'm most proud of is the work I did on those legs. Considering what I had around the house, I don't think there's a doctor who could have done any better.
L387354 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Will I be able to walk?
L387353 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they?  It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, I promise you.
L387350 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ The  blizzard was too strong. I couldn't risk trying to get you there. I tried calling, but the phone lines are down.
L387349 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Shouldn't I be in a hospital?
L387348 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ They're called Novril--they're for your pain. 
L387347 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What are they...?
L387346 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Here.
L387344 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ --my number one fan.
L387343 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
L387342 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ How long...?
L387341 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
L387722 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ There's that spice again.
L387721 +++$+++ u6618 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ It's good you found it.
L387720 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
L387719 +++$+++ u6618 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ What is it?
L387718 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ That thing.  Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.
L387717 +++$+++ u6618 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ What thing?
L387716 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.  Where the hell is that thing?
L387715 +++$+++ u6618 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ Oh, I like that tone.
L387714 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ Just leave it, all right?
L387696 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ "There is a justice higher than that of man--I will be judged by Him."
L387695 +++$+++ u6618 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ That's nice.
L387694 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ They're hauling Misery into court.
L387693 +++$+++ u6618 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ What?
L387692 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ "There is a justice higher than that of man. I will be judged by Him."
L387654 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ Now, you see, it's that kind of sarcasm that's given our marriage real spice.
L387653 +++$+++ u6618 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
L387652 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.
L387651 +++$+++ u6618 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
L387650 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ Hey, Jim, what's doing? Uh-huh... uh- huh... Jim, we've been over this. If you're gonna have benches in front of your store, people are gonna sit on them. I don't like him either, but I'm not going to come over there and tell him to move. Give my best to Denise. Bye.
L387602 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ There's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars: the ones that can't afford new ones, and the ones who wouldn't give 'em up for anything in the world. That second bunch don't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents.
L387601 +++$+++ u6618 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
L387600 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
L387599 +++$+++ u6618 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ You don't think he's dead, do you?
L387502 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ Just from his agent.
L387501 +++$+++ u6618 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek.  Any calls?
L387441 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.
L387440 +++$+++ u6618 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ You really think Sheldon's out there?
L387437 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things.
L387436 +++$+++ u6618 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ Could be the weight of the snow.
L387434 +++$+++ u6618 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ What? What is it?
L387433 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ Stop--stop right here.
L387432 +++$+++ u6618 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ Well, this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff.
L387431 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ Virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy.
L387380 +++$+++ u6618 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ Four or five days ago. Why?
L387379 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
L387378 +++$+++ u6618 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.
L387377 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ G'bye, Ms. Sindell.
L387376 +++$+++ u6617 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ SINDELL +++$+++ I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
L387374 +++$+++ u6617 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ SINDELL +++$+++ I hate that I made this call--tell me I'm being silly.
L387373 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ You think he might be missing?
L387372 +++$+++ u6617 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ SINDELL +++$+++ No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...
L387371 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ I don't know. Does he always phone you when he checks out of hotels?
L387370 +++$+++ u6617 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ SINDELL +++$+++ Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
L387369 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.
L387368 +++$+++ u6617 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ SINDELL +++$+++ I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.
L387367 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ People sure like those Misery books.
L387366 +++$+++ u6617 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ SINDELL +++$+++ Yes, he is.
L387365 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ He's your client, huh?
L387364 +++$+++ u6617 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ SINDELL +++$+++ Yes.
L387363 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
L387362 +++$+++ u6617 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ SINDELL +++$+++ I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble.
L387412 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ I'm sure you're right.
L387411 +++$+++ u6614 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ LIBBY +++$+++ I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
L387410 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ So do I...
L387409 +++$+++ u6614 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ LIBBY +++$+++ I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
L387408 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
L387407 +++$+++ u6614 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ LIBBY +++$+++ No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.
L387406 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ Maybe you can, Libby.
L387405 +++$+++ u6614 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ LIBBY +++$+++ Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne.
L387738 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ Oh. That kind. Nothing odd about that.
L387737 +++$+++ u6616 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ No, the typing kind.
L387736 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ Newspapers?
L387735 +++$+++ u6616 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
L387734 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ Has she been buying any odd things lately?
L387733 +++$+++ u6616 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.
L387732 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
L387731 +++$+++ u6616 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
L387730 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
L387729 +++$+++ u6616 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ If I can.
L387728 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ Answer me a couple things?
L387727 +++$+++ u6616 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Buster.
L387726 +++$+++ u6613 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ BUSTER +++$+++ Hey, Pete.
L387850 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I am. Well, maybe not completely--
L387849 +++$+++ u6617 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ SINDELL +++$+++ I thought you were over it.
L387848 +++$+++ u6617 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ SINDELL +++$+++ Now you've hurt me, Paul.
L387847 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
L387846 +++$+++ u6617 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ SINDELL +++$+++ Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
L387845 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well, I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper.  Don't think I'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me.
L387844 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'm delighted the critics are liking it, and I hope the people like it, too. But it's not why I wrote the book.
L387843 +++$+++ u6617 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ SINDELL +++$+++ I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
L387842 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Great.
L387841 +++$+++ u6617 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ SINDELL +++$+++ And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
L387840 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ That'd be a first.
L387839 +++$+++ u6617 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ SINDELL +++$+++ The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter.
L387838 +++$+++ u6617 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ SINDELL +++$+++ Here it is.  Very first copy.
L387837 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yeah. They're in the semis.
L387836 +++$+++ u6617 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ SINDELL +++$+++ Did they win?
L387835 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Sorry I'm late. Jenny's basketball game went into overtime. If anybody ever told me I'd have a daughter who'd get a triple double, I'd...
L387338 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Marcia, why are you doing this to me? Don't you know I'm scared enough? Don't you think I remember how nobody gave a shit about my first books? You think I'm dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness?  I'm doing this because I have to.  Now, I'm leaving for Colorado to try to finish this and I want your good thoughts--because if I can make it work ...  I might just have something that I want on my tombstone.
L387337 +++$+++ u6617 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ SINDELL +++$+++ I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.
L387336 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever.  For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.
L387335 +++$+++ u6617 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ SINDELL +++$+++ No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
L387334 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Marcia, please.
L387333 +++$+++ u6617 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ SINDELL +++$+++ Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
L387332 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
L387331 +++$+++ u6617 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ SINDELL +++$+++ You're still a writer.
L387330 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
L387329 +++$+++ u6617 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ SINDELL +++$+++ It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
L387328 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.
L388530 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ Hugh, I'm impressed..
L388529 +++$+++ u6627 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ STAMP +++$+++ Afraid he's got no choice.  I believe I broke his jaw.
L388285 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ In the envelope in my pocket.  My right.. jacket..pocket..
L388284 +++$+++ u6627 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ STAMP +++$+++ Where is it?
L388283 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
L388282 +++$+++ u6627 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ STAMP +++$+++ I thought you were going to dinner.
L388174 +++$+++ u6627 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ STAMP +++$+++ Sean, please..
L388173 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ You're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance, are you?
L388170 +++$+++ u6627 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ STAMP +++$+++ Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate.
L388169 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ One considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down.  Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive.
L388168 +++$+++ u6627 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ STAMP +++$+++ Wasn't exactly gagging for it when she left you six months ago..The question is, do you trust her?
L388167 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ From her point of view or mine?
L388166 +++$+++ u6627 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ STAMP +++$+++ Not everything.  Why do you think she's really here?
L387881 +++$+++ u6627 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ STAMP +++$+++ Not possible..
L387880 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ - right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
L387879 +++$+++ u6627 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ STAMP +++$+++ All done, chief..
L387878 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ - pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence..
L388469 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ In just a few hours you can be assured of going down in history as the typhoid Mary of Oz.  G'day.
L388468 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L388467 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ If it'll make you feel any better, you're going to take a lot of Aussies with you and make me a lot of money.
L388466 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ If it'll make you feel any better I won't do it again.
L388465 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ God damn it, Nyah!  Why did you do it?  Why did you save that bastard?
L388464 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Not as much as you feel like hearing it.
L388463 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ Feel like pleading for your life?
L388281 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Lovely.
L388280 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
L388279 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
L388278 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ Yes.  We won't be able to have dinner tonight.  Something's come up.  I hope you don't mind.
L388277 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ A change of plans?
L388276 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
L388275 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Sort it all out.
L388274 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ To do what?
L388273 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
L388272 +++$+++ u6619 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ Then don't say it.
