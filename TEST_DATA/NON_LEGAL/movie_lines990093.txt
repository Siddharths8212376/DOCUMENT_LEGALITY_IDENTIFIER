L362936 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot of people.  I wanted to tell you that. I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me.
L362935 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ What?
L362934 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ I lost my gun.

L362867 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --
L362866 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ ...nothing.  I'm sorry...
L362865 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L362864 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ It's fine.
L362863 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --

L362860 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ You really use strong language.
L362859 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ What?
L362858 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Wow....huh..."...piss and shit..."
L362857 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Ok.  I'll tell you everything and you tell me everything and maybe we can get through all the piss and shit and lies that kill other people....
L362856 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Let's make a deal.
L362855 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ To not do that.  To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
L362854 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ ...yeah...
L362853 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
L362852 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ ok.
L362851 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ You wanna make a deal with me?
L362850 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ No, no.
L362849 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ And I bet you say that to all the girls --
L362848 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.
L362847 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Why not?
L362846 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Well I don't go out very much.
L362845 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ So you've done it --
L362844 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
L362843 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --
L362614 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Bye.
L362613 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Great, bye.

L362610 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
L362609 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Billingsley's?
L362608 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
L362607 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
L362606 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
L362605 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Eight o'clock?
L362604 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
L362603 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?
L362602 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I thought you were flirting with me a little.
L362601 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Yeah.
L362600 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Really?
L362599 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.
L362598 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
L362597 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ No.
L362596 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Well...is that illegal?
L362595 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Please, yes.
L362594 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ You wanna go on a date with me?
L362593 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
L362592 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ What is it?  Did you forget something?
L362591 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ I'm sorry, Claudia.
L362590 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Good bye.

L362585 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
L362584 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L362583 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.
L362582 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ If you're not here for a 422 --
L362581 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee --
L362580 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started.
L362579 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ This is my job.
L362578 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Tempural-something-mandibular, thing with something, I dunno. But it affects my ear, I don't even know if I have TMJ exactly but just very tight, like - it's like a muscle spasm and it's just gets so clenched --
L362577 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ What's that stand for?
L362576 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ --- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.
L362535 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Thank you.
L362534 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
L362533 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Ok, ok. I'm back.
L362344 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Okey-doke.
L362343 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick.
L362342 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ But I wouldn't mind comin' back in an hour just to see your pretty face!
L362341 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ You won't.  You won't have to.
L362340 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
L362339 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
L362338 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
L362337 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ It's not -- what's a 422?
L362336 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
L362335 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ -- is not my boyfriend.
L362334 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ The gentleman who came to the door --
L362333 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I don't have a boyfriend.
L362332 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Is this boyfriend bothering you?
L362331 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Arlight, then.  Cheers.
L362330 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Yeah.
L362329 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
L362328 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ You take cream or sugar?
L362327 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
L362326 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
L362325 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ That's great, thank you.
L362324 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ -- do you wanna cup?
L362323 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --
L362322 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
L362321 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ got some coffee brewing, huh?
L362162 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I don't have a boyfriend.

L362153 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
L362152 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ What are you lookin' for?
L362151 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ It's fine.
L362150 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ You mind if I check things back here?
L362149 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I was...he's gone...I mean it's not. It's over, y'know --
L362148 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Who was it?
L362147 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ No.
L362146 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ You don't have a boyfriend?

L362144 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Was it a boyfriend of yours?
L362143 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
L362142 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?
L362141 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ No.
L362138 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually?
L362137 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ Yeah.
L362136 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?
L362135 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ I didn't realize it was that loud.
L362134 +++$+++ u6434 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIM KURRING +++$+++ Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
L362133 +++$+++ u6420 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ CLAUDIA +++$+++ No.
