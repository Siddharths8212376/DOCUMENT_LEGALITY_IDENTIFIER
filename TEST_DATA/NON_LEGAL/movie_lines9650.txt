L117366 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
L117365 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
L117364 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ I doubt that.
L117363 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
L117362 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ And now you wanta teach me?
L117361 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
L117360 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ Who are you?  Do you have a job?
L117359 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I want you desperately!
L117358 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ And he's right!  A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often.  You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are!  And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
L117357 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ He won't make love to me anymore.
L117356 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
L117355 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I want to be had.
L117354 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ You're gorgeous, God damn it! From the moment I first saw you I knew I had to have you.  I had to have you!
L117353 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Don't you think I'm pretty?
L117352 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ Aren't we all?
L117351 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ He' s confused--
L117350 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
L117349 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Crash...I want you.
L116979 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'm not a real batter.  I'm a woman.
L116978 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
L116977 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You got me all confused.
L116976 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ Well, Annie, your place or mine?
L116973 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ Fact is you're afraid of meeting a guy like me 'cause It might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around--  Great deal.  You get to write self- indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing-  So what do you really want?  You wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic?  Or do you want a guy?
L116972 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
L116971 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ Your place or mine?
L116970 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ Let me.
L116969 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Damn.
L116968 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ No.  Please.
L116967 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
L116966 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ 247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
L116965 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
L116964 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ Don't tell anybody.
L116963 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ But they're nice hips.  I looked up your records-- You've hit 227 home runs in the minors. That's great!
L116962 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ You're pulling your hips out.
L116961 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Damn.
L116960 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ That's my job too.
L116959 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
L116958 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
L116957 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
L116956 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ So...Wanta make love?
L116955 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ But you were pulling your hips last night.
L116954 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
L116953 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
L116952 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ Yep.
L116951 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ See my hips?
L116895 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'm not interested yet.
L116894 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
L116893 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Wait, Crash--don't go--all I want is a date.  I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'.
L116891 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ G'night.
L116890 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh my...  Don't leave...
L116889 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap.  I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in the "sweet spot", voting every election, soft core pornography, chocolate chip cookies, opening your presents on Christmas morning rather than Christmas eve, and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last for 7 days.
L116888 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What do you believe in?
L116887 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout.  Besides-- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart...or loins.
L116884 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction.  There are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart.
L116883 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
L116882 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ These are the ground rules.  I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other.
L116853 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ I'll learn.  C'mon--
L116852 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Crash, I didn't think you--
L116851 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ She's dancing with me.
L116843 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I don't trust a man who don't dance.  It ain't natural.
L116842 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ I don't dance.
L116841 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
L116840 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ I'm Crash Davis.
L117269 +++$+++ u4320 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ He'll learn.
L117268 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson.  Big mistake...
L117243 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ He looks wonderful, Jackson...
L117242 +++$+++ u4320 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ Ninety-three miles an hour.
L117191 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That's not necessary, Jackson---  Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.
L117190 +++$+++ u4320 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe--
L117044 +++$+++ u4320 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ Ninety-five miles an hour...
L117043 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh dear....easy honey...
L116788 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It says he's not bending his back on his follow-through.
L116787 +++$+++ u4320 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ What's it say?
L116786 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.
L116777 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ He looks great, just great!
L116776 +++$+++ u4320 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ Ninety-five miles an hour.
L116760 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Three-fourteen?  Hmmm...  Look't those thighs, Jackson
L116759 +++$+++ u4320 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
L116758 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?
L117484 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ She will, Mr.  LaLoosh, she will ...
L117483 +++$+++ u4326 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE'S FATHER +++$+++ God bless you.
L117477 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh let's not...
L117476 +++$+++ u4326 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE'S FATHER +++$+++ Let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the Lord for all this--
L117462 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Praise the Lord, eh?
L117461 +++$+++ u4326 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE'S FATHER +++$+++ We were worried that Ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball--we're so pleased, he met a Christian woman.
L117460 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ He's a good student.
L117458 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Uh oh...  Can I offer you some coffee?
L117457 +++$+++ u4326 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE'S FATHER +++$+++ Ebby's told me a lot about you.
L116916 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Shh, shh...  "They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, and discorrupt them and charge them"
L116915 +++$+++ u4318 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ EBBY +++$+++ We gonna fuck or what?
L116914 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Good--then listen.  "I sing the body electric.  The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them--"
L116913 +++$+++ u4318 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ EBBY +++$+++ Never heard of 'em.
L116912 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
L116911 +++$+++ u4318 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ EBBY +++$+++ Who's he play for?
L116910 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
L116907 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You think Dwight Gooden leaves his socks on?
L116906 +++$+++ u4318 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ EBBY +++$+++ The socks?  It's cold in here.
L116905 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.
L116903 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ When you know how to make love, you'll know how to pitch.  Shh.  I love this part.
L116902 +++$+++ u4318 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ EBBY +++$+++ Jesus, what kinda broad are you?
L116901 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No, no, no.  Put it back on and take it off slowly.
L116899 +++$+++ u4318 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ EBBY +++$+++ Well shit, then, let's fuck.
L116898 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No ballplayer ever said "no" to a date with me.
L116886 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
L116885 +++$+++ u4318 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ EBBY +++$+++ Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
L116881 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh both of you, of course...
L116880 +++$+++ u4318 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ EBBY +++$+++ Which one of us?
L116879 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well--you boys stopped fighting yet?  Are you pals now?  Good.  I love a little macho male bonding-- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being "re-channeled" but I believe in "re-channeling" so who cares, right?  Shall we go to my place?
L116850 +++$+++ u4318 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ EBBY +++$+++ That's what I been telling everybody!  Wanta dance?
L116849 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You need a nickname.
L116848 +++$+++ u4318 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ EBBY +++$+++ Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
L116847 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You got a live arm there.
L116846 +++$+++ u4318 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ EBBY +++$+++ Thanks for the note--you're right, I wasn't bending my back.
L117019 +++$+++ u4316 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ C'mon, God damn it, gimme some!
L117018 +++$+++ u4322 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ JOSE +++$+++ No, that is not belief.  That is desperation.
L117017 +++$+++ u4316 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'm 0 for 16!  Gimme some of that shit.
L117016 +++$+++ u4322 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ JOSE +++$+++ If you believe in Voodoo.
L117015 +++$+++ u4316 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Will that work for me?
L117014 +++$+++ u4322 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ JOSE +++$+++ Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
L117013 +++$+++ u4316 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You a God damn witch?
L117012 +++$+++ u4322 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ JOSE +++$+++ Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
L117011 +++$+++ u4316 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What's that?
L117445 +++$+++ u4330 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ UMPIRE +++$+++ You're outta here!
L117444 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ You're a cocksucker!
L117443 +++$+++ u4330 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ UMPIRE +++$+++ Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
L117442 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ Beg me again!

L117438 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
L117437 +++$+++ u4330 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ UMPIRE +++$+++ You're close, Crash, you want me to run you?  I'll run you!
L117436 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
L117435 +++$+++ u4330 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ UMPIRE +++$+++ I didn't spit on you!
L117434 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ You spit on me!
L117433 +++$+++ u4330 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ UMPIRE +++$+++ You missed the tag!
L117432 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
L117431 +++$+++ u4330 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ UMPIRE +++$+++ Did you call me a cocksucker?
L117430 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ It was a cocksucking call!
L117429 +++$+++ u4330 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ UMPIRE +++$+++ Don't bump me.
L117428 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ God damn It, Jack, he still ain't touched the plate.
L117427 +++$+++ u4330 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ UMPIRE +++$+++ You missed him!
L117426 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ I got him on the knee!
L117550 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ You too...Meat.
L117549 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ Nuke--  Good luck.
L117548 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ Yeah, thanks for everything.
L117547 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ It's the best, Nuke...the absolute fucking best.
L117546 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ Maybe you do.  Y'know I'm starting to like this game--baseball's a helluva good way to make a living.
L117545 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ I don't need a crazy woman in my life.
L117544 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ Well, I got Annie all warmed up for ya...  She's just waiting for you to show up, y'know...
L117543 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up.
L117542 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
L117541 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ Fear and ignorance.
L117540 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
L117539 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ No.
L117538 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
L117537 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ Forget it.
L117536 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ Sorry about last night.
L117534 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ If ya get in a fight with some asshole, never hit his with your pitching hand.  ya might get injured.  That's another lesson for ya--now quit fucking around and help me up.
L117533 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ What?
L117532 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ Good.  Good.  That's terrific...
L117531 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ My right.
L117530 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left?
L117527 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ You know what the difference Is between hitting .250 and hitting .300?  1 got it figured out.  Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at bats is 50 points.  Okay?  There's 6 months in a season, that's about 25 weeks--you get one extra flare a week--just one--a gork, a ground ball with eyes, a dying quail-- just one more dying quail a week and you're in Yankee Stadium!
L117526 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ I'll take you back to the hotel.
L117524 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ Okay, I'll kick your ass there.
L117523 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ No.
L117522 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
L117521 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ You're a great catcher.
