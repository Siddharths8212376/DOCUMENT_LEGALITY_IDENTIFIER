L293863 +++$+++ u5969 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MRS. MUSSBURGER +++$+++ -- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!
L294124 +++$+++ u5970 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MUSSBURGER +++$+++ Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems -- well, there was a spy in the company...
L294123 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
L294122 +++$+++ u5970 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MUSSBURGER +++$+++ It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
L294121 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ How's that, Sid?
L294120 +++$+++ u5970 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MUSSBURGER +++$+++ Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
L294119 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Ya don't say.
L294118 +++$+++ u5970 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MUSSBURGER +++$+++ Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
L294117 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale is really murder.
L293971 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Well... I'm for it...
L293970 +++$+++ u5970 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MUSSBURGER +++$+++ ...Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours.
L293642 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ -- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
L293641 +++$+++ u5970 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MUSSBURGER +++$+++ Finally.
L293640 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ -- But there's such an enormous potential profit-wise given the demographics -- baby boom -- discretionary income in the burgeoning middle class --
L293639 +++$+++ u5970 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MUSSBURGER +++$+++ Damnit, where's my car!
L293638 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --
L293637 +++$+++ u5970 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MUSSBURGER +++$+++ I do remember and I was impressed. Anyway, that's all forgotten now. Driver!
L293636 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ ...You don't happen to remember the plan I outlined to you the day I set fire to your off -- uh, the day I was promoted?
L293635 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the expert, but --
L293634 +++$+++ u5970 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MUSSBURGER +++$+++ Relax, Norville. It's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover.
L293625 +++$+++ u5970 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MUSSBURGER +++$+++ Lobby. We haven't got all day.
L293624 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. I never did give you that--
L293578 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Oh my God, sir!
L293577 +++$+++ u5970 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MUSSBURGER +++$+++ My God! The Bumstead contracts!
L293574 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Sir, my leg is on fire!
L293573 +++$+++ u5970 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MUSSBURGER +++$+++ Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
L293571 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ But, sir!
L293570 +++$+++ u5970 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MUSSBURGER +++$+++ Not that way! Through the door!
L293568 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Oh my God, sir!
L293567 +++$+++ u5970 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MUSSBURGER +++$+++ Why you nitwit. You almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career!
L293565 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Oh my God, sir!
L293564 +++$+++ u5970 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MUSSBURGER +++$+++ You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!
L293563 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Oh my God, sir!
L293562 +++$+++ u5970 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MUSSBURGER +++$+++ My God! The Bumstead contracts!!
L293561 +++$+++ u5970 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MUSSBURGER +++$+++ Get out of my sight.
L293560 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ But --
L293559 +++$+++ u5970 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MUSSBURGER +++$+++ Get your feet off that desk.
L293558 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ But, sir! --
L293557 +++$+++ u5970 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MUSSBURGER +++$+++ You're fired.
L293556 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
L293555 +++$+++ u5970 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MUSSBURGER +++$+++ Not even behind your back?
L293554 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ No, sir.
L293553 +++$+++ u5970 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MUSSBURGER +++$+++ ...'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'? 'Lamebrain'?
L293552 +++$+++ u5970 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MUSSBURGER +++$+++ Sure, sure. And did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or...  ...'schmoe'?
L293551 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ At the Muncie College of Business Administration.
L293550 +++$+++ u5970 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MUSSBURGER +++$+++ Hmmm.
L293549 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Well, I made the dean's list.
L293548 +++$+++ u5970 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MUSSBURGER +++$+++ All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
L293547 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Well, I'm a college graduate --
L293546 +++$+++ u5970 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MUSSBURGER +++$+++ ...education, were you?
L293536 +++$+++ u5970 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MUSSBURGER +++$+++ Wait a minute!
L293535 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ ...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
L293528 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ You --
L293527 +++$+++ u5970 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MUSSBURGER +++$+++ You, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- scratch that; I'll fire him.  ...Make it fast, make it fast.
L293526 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ I --
L293525 +++$+++ u5970 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MUSSBURGER +++$+++ Tell him I'll be right there...  Well, what is it?
L293522 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ I --
L293521 +++$+++ u5970 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ MUSSBURGER +++$+++ ...Who let you in?
L293686 +++$+++ u5974 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #2 +++$+++ She's damn good, Lou.
L293685 +++$+++ u5973 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #1 +++$+++ She's good, Bennie.
L293684 +++$+++ u5974 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #2 +++$+++ She is!
L293683 +++$+++ u5973 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #1 +++$+++ She isn't!
L293681 +++$+++ u5973 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #1 +++$+++ He don't look wise.
L293680 +++$+++ u5974 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #2 +++$+++ Maybe he's wise.
L293678 +++$+++ u5973 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #1 +++$+++ No, Bennie: Lumbago.
L293677 +++$+++ u5974 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #2 +++$+++ ...adenoids.
L293676 +++$+++ u5973 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #1 +++$+++ ...Her mother needs an operation...
L293675 +++$+++ u5974 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #2 +++$+++ She's got other problems, of course...
L293671 +++$+++ u5973 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #1 +++$+++ He notices.
L293670 +++$+++ u5974 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #2 +++$+++ Hello, Niagara.
L293669 +++$+++ u5973 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #1 +++$+++ Old Faithful.
L293668 +++$+++ u5974 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #2 +++$+++ Yellowstone.
L293667 +++$+++ u5973 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #1 +++$+++ Plan two: Here come the waterworks.
L293666 +++$+++ u5974 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #2 +++$+++ He don't look wise.
L293665 +++$+++ u5973 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #1 +++$+++ Maybe he's wise.
L293664 +++$+++ u5974 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #2 +++$+++ ...He's not noticing, Benny.
L293663 +++$+++ u5973 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #1 +++$+++ The mark notices.
L293662 +++$+++ u5974 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #2 +++$+++ ...No money.
L293661 +++$+++ u5973 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #1 +++$+++ She looks in her purse...
L293660 +++$+++ u5974 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #2 +++$+++ ...and awduhs a light lunch.
L293659 +++$+++ u5973 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #1 +++$+++ She sits down.
L293658 +++$+++ u5974 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #2 +++$+++ She finds him.
L293657 +++$+++ u5973 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #1 +++$+++ She's looking for her mark.
L293656 +++$+++ u5974 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #2 +++$+++ Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
L293655 +++$+++ u5973 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #1 +++$+++ Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
L293654 +++$+++ u5974 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #2 +++$+++ There's one in every story.
L293653 +++$+++ u5973 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #1 +++$+++ ...Enter the dame.
L293652 +++$+++ u5973 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #1 +++$+++ Fah from it...
L293651 +++$+++ u5974 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #2 +++$+++ Ya get the special?
L293650 +++$+++ u5973 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #1 +++$+++ No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
L293649 +++$+++ u5974 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #2 +++$+++ Yeah, tell me about it.
L293648 +++$+++ u5973 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ VETERAN #1 +++$+++ I got gas, Bennie.
L296233 +++$+++ u5975 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ ALMA +++$+++ Yes, Miss Betsy.  I mean that.  The Houngan will speak to the rada drums and the drums will speak to Shango and Damballa.
L296232 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
L296231 +++$+++ u5975 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ ALMA +++$+++ No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
L296230 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ You mean Mama Rose was like Mrs. Holland?
L296229 +++$+++ u5975 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ ALMA +++$+++ They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy.  Mama Rose was mindless.  I was at the Houmfort when the Houngan brought her mind back.
L296228 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ That's nonsense, Alma.
L296227 +++$+++ u5975 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ ALMA +++$+++ At the Houmfort.
L296226 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Where?
L296225 +++$+++ u5975 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ ALMA +++$+++ There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
L296224 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ What do you mean -- "doctors that are people"?
L296223 +++$+++ u5975 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ ALMA +++$+++ Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
L296222 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.  They can't cure everything.
L296221 +++$+++ u5975 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ ALMA +++$+++ Things so bad, nobody can help -- not even Doctor Maxwell.
L296076 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Looks like an awful lot of breakfast -- I don't know whether I'll be able to get away with it.
L296075 +++$+++ u5975 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ ALMA +++$+++ A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."
L296074 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ What's this?
L296073 +++$+++ u5975 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ ALMA +++$+++ I do my best.  Every day I dress her just as beautifully as if she was well.  It's just like dressing a great, big doll.
L296072 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
L296071 +++$+++ u5975 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ ALMA +++$+++ She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
L296070 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ She must have been beautiful.  What happened to her, Alma?
L296069 +++$+++ u5975 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ ALMA +++$+++ Miss Jessica used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast -- in bed, with a lacy cushion to bank her head up. If you'd only seen her, Miss Connell. She looked so pretty.
L296068 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Thank you, Alma.
L296067 +++$+++ u5975 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ ALMA +++$+++ I know, miss.  But I like to do it. I like to tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you.  You settle right back, now, and I'll mix you your coffee.
L296066 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma. You don't have to do that for me.
L296064 +++$+++ u5975 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ ALMA +++$+++ I didn't want to frighten you out of your sleep, Miss.  That's why I touched you farthest from your heart.
L296063 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Thank you for waking me.
L296062 +++$+++ u5975 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ ALMA +++$+++ Good morning, miss.
L296008 +++$+++ u5977 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ COACHMAN +++$+++ If you say, miss.  If you say.
L296007 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
L296006 +++$+++ u5977 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ COACHMAN +++$+++ If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.
L296005 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ You mean a figurehead.
L296004 +++$+++ u5977 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ COACHMAN +++$+++ No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.
L296003 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Alive?
L296002 +++$+++ u5977 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ COACHMAN +++$+++ A man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face.
L296001 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Ti-Misery?  What's that?
L296000 +++$+++ u5977 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ COACHMAN +++$+++ Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer.  The Holland's are a most old family, miss.  They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.
L296348 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Mrs. Rand was at the Houmfort that night.  But there's nothing wrong with that.  She's gone there for years -- trying to take care of those people,  to help them.
L296347 +++$+++ u5981 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ MRS. RAND +++$+++ You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
L296346 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Mrs. Rand...
L296326 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ That's sweet of you, Mrs. Rand.
L296325 +++$+++ u5981 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ MRS. RAND +++$+++ Why, Betsy -- we can't lose you. You mean too much to us here.
L296262 +++$+++ u5981 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ MRS. RAND +++$+++ Perhaps not.  But I did come here and I found it was so simple to let the gods speak through me. Once started, it seemed such an easy way to do good.  I should have known there was no easy way to do good, Betsy.
L296261 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ But you didn't have to come up here.
L296260 +++$+++ u5981 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ MRS. RAND +++$+++ -- and when my husband died I felt helpless. They disobeyed me -- things went from bad to worse. All my husband's dreams of good health, good sanitation, good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him.  Then, almost accidentally, I discovered the secret of how to deal with them. There was a girl with a baby -- again and again I begged her to boil the drinking water. She never would. Then I told her the god, Shango, would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it. She boiled the water from then on.
L296259 +++$+++ u5981 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ MRS. RAND +++$+++ I asked you to let me explain. It's a long story.  And not an easy one --
L296258 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
L296257 +++$+++ u5981 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ MRS. RAND +++$+++ I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
L296256 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ But, Mrs. Rand --
L296255 +++$+++ u5981 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ MRS. RAND +++$+++ Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
L296254 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Mrs. Rand.
L296244 +++$+++ u5981 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ MRS. RAND +++$+++ Her son drowned.  She brooded until her mind was affected. All the Houngan did was coax her out of it with a little practical psychology.
L296243 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
L296242 +++$+++ u5981 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ MRS. RAND +++$+++ Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?
L296241 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
L296240 +++$+++ u5981 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ MRS. RAND +++$+++ A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
L296239 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ You don't believe in it?
L296238 +++$+++ u5981 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ MRS. RAND +++$+++ Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
L296237 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
L296236 +++$+++ u5981 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ MRS. RAND +++$+++ Some of this native nonsense. The Houngan has his prescription and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.
L296165 +++$+++ u5981 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ MRS. RAND +++$+++ Try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
L296164 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
L296163 +++$+++ u5981 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ MRS. RAND +++$+++ Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
L296162 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ I'd love to.
L296161 +++$+++ u5981 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ MRS. RAND +++$+++ So -- he says I'm nice.  He's a nice boy, too, Miss Connell, a very nice boy.  But I'm worried about his drinking.
L296160 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Thank you, Mrs. Rand.  I think you're every bit as nice as Wes says you are.
L296159 +++$+++ u5981 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ MRS. RAND +++$+++ Nonsense, child!  I know Wesley's been drinking too much lately.  I know a great deal more about what goes on at Fort Holland than you'd think.  I know all about you -- that you're a nice girl, competent and kind to Jessica.  The Fort needs a girl like you.  But now we've got to get you back there.  I'll walk you back and stay over night.  It'll be a nice change for me.
L296158 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Believe me, Mrs. Rand, he doesn't do this often. This is the first time I've seen him --
L296157 +++$+++ u5981 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ MRS. RAND +++$+++ Come, come, don't tell me how sorry you are that I should meet you this way.  I'm even a little glad that Wesley's difficulty brought us together.
L296156 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Oh, Mrs. Rand --
L296155 +++$+++ u5981 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ MRS. RAND +++$+++ I really intended going out to the Fort and meeting you long before this, Miss Connell.  I'm Mrs. Rand -- Wesley's mother.
L296149 +++$+++ u5981 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ MRS. RAND +++$+++ Ti-Joseph?
L296148 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ I'm afraid so.
L296147 +++$+++ u5981 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ MRS. RAND +++$+++ I think you need some help.
L296341 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
L296340 +++$+++ u5978 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ DR. MAXWELL +++$+++ Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
L296206 +++$+++ u5978 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ DR. MAXWELL +++$+++ It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland.  The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.
L296205 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.
L296099 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Thank you.
L296098 +++$+++ u5978 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ DR. MAXWELL +++$+++ I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.
L296096 +++$+++ u5978 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ DR. MAXWELL +++$+++ Fortunately, not.  This is my first experience with it as a physician. But I have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call Zombies.  I am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever.
L296095 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Is this disease common in the tropics?
L296094 +++$+++ u5978 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ DR. MAXWELL +++$+++ I've never heard of a cure.
L296093 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ She can never be cured?
L296092 +++$+++ u5978 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ DR. MAXWELL +++$+++ I don't know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.
L296091 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Does she suffer?
L295987 +++$+++ u5983 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ WILKENS +++$+++ That's rather nice, isn't it?
L295986 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ But it's so far away...
L295985 +++$+++ u5983 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ WILKENS +++$+++ A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.
L295984 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ The West Indies?
L295983 +++$+++ u5983 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ WILKENS +++$+++ No, this is quite final.  You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.  He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.
L295982 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ That will mean another interview, won't it?
L295981 +++$+++ u5983 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ WILKENS +++$+++ I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
L295980 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.
L295979 +++$+++ u5983 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ WILKENS +++$+++ Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
L295978 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.
L295976 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ At the Memorial Hospital -- here in Ottawa.
L295975 +++$+++ u5983 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ WILKENS +++$+++ Where were you trained?
L295974 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Yes.
L295973 +++$+++ u5983 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ WILKENS +++$+++ You're single?
L296385 +++$+++ u5982 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Jessica was never any good for Paul.  You will be, you are.  And Mother -- seeing Jessica day after day -- never able to escape, never able to forget.  Please, Betsy -- it's only merciful.
L296384 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ No, Wes.
L296380 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Please, Wes, do as I ask.  You must rest, you must sleep.
L296379 +++$+++ u5982 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!
L296378 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ But she's not dead, Wes.
L296377 +++$+++ u5982 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ She's dead.  The dead ought to be buried.
L296376 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
L296375 +++$+++ u5982 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
L296374 +++$+++ u5976 +++$+++ m396 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
