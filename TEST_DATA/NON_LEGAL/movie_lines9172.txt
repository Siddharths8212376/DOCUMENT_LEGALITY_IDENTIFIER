L310697 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Never mind, son. She doesn't want it. 
L311201 +++$+++ u1533 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ DANKER +++$+++ "Young people in love Are very seldom hungry. People in love Are very seldom hungry . . ."
L311200 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No.
L311199 +++$+++ u1533 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ DANKER +++$+++ Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
L311198 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No, thanks. We're not hungry.
L311195 +++$+++ u1533 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ DANKER +++$+++ . . . turn."
L311194 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ All right, let it go.
L311193 +++$+++ u1533 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ DANKER +++$+++ Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn— As life's corners I . . .
L311192 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?
L310983 +++$+++ u1534 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ Phone for help?  We're right in the middle of nowhere. There isn't a town within ten miles of here.
L310982 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
L310981 +++$+++ u1534 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.
L310582 +++$+++ u1534 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ Maybe they do—and maybe they don't.
L310581 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
L310580 +++$+++ u1534 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ Yeah?
L310579 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Driver!
L310571 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You win!
L310570 +++$+++ u1534 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ Oh, yeah?
L310569 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
L310568 +++$+++ u1534 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ Oh, yeah?
L310567 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Look here, partner. You may not like my nose. But I do. It's a good nose. The only one I've got. I always keep it out in the open where anybody can take a sock at it. If you decide to do it, make sure you don't miss.
L310566 +++$+++ u1534 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
L310565 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
L310564 +++$+++ u1534 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
L310563 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
L310562 +++$+++ u1534 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ Hey, whadda you tryin' to do—kid me?
L310561 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ That's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants.
L310560 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Oh—the papers—
L310559 +++$+++ u1534 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
L310558 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Huh?
L310557 +++$+++ u1534 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ What do you think you're doing!
L310554 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off.
L310553 +++$+++ u1534 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. 
L310552 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
L310551 +++$+++ u1534 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ Whadda you want!
L311561 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
L311560 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
L311559 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Same to you.
L311558 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Congratulations.
L311557 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You bet I did.
L311556 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I hope you got your money.
L311277 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I don't care. I love you. Nothing else matters. We can run away. Everything'll take care of itself.  Please, Peter. You can't go out of my life now. I couldn't live without you.  Oh, Peter—
L311276 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You're forgetting you're married.
L311275 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I love you.
L311274 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Better go back to your bed.
L311269 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Maybe.  Sure—sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'd—  Yeah, but where you going to find her—somebody that's real—somebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more.
L311268 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
L311267 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Me?
L311266 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
L311258 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Why not?
L311257 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Nope.
L311256 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Thank you.  Am I going to see you in New York?
L311252 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah, swell.
L311251 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you?
L311241 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Okay.  Cottage Number Three.
L311240 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
L311239 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
L311238 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ That's swell!
L311237 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
L311236 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What about money?
L311235 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
L311234 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Any luck?
L311219 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Darling!
L311218 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
L311216 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ A black eye. 
L311215 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What'd you give him for the car?
L311214 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
L311213 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What happened?
L311212 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Come on! come on! 
L311211 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on—
L311210 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Come on—get in.
L311209 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
L311206 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ If you do, I'll break your neck.
L311205 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Never!  I'm going in and ask him—
L311204 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Eat a carrot.
L311203 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Why not? I'm hungry.
L311202 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
L311189 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ We don't need forty cars.
L311188 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
L311187 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
L311186 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What for?
L311185 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You might give me a little credit.
L311184 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Mind your own business.
L311183 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What're you going to do?
L311182 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a car—and I won't use my thumb.
L311181 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You! Don't make me laugh.
L311180 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
L311179 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
L311178 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
L311177 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
L311175 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.
L311174 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Here comes a car!
L311173 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Hm? Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.
L311172 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Amazing.
L311171 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're broke—and hungry—and everything looks black. It's a long movement like this—  —with a follow through.
L311170 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You figured that all out yourself, huh?
L311169 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Number two is a wider movement—a smile goes with that one—like this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
L311168 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Clever.
L311167 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ But the thumb always works. Different ways to do it, though. Depends on how you feel. For instance, number one is a short, jerky movement—  That shows independence. You don't care if they stop or not. 'Cause you got some money in your pocket, see?
L311164 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Well, it is simple. It's all in the thumb, see? A lot of people do it—
L311163 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Oh, no!
L311162 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You think it's simple, huh?
L311161 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ There's no end to your accomplishments.
L311160 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."
L311159 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You're an expert, I suppose.
L311158 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
L311157 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What if nobody stops for us?
L311156 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I wish you wouldn't talk too much. We let a car get away. 
L311155 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I hate the horrid stuff.
L311154 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for you—carrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught me—goodnight!
L311153 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
L311152 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Uh-huh. Want one?
L311151 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Raw?
L311150 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Carrots.
L311149 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
L311148 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
L311147 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Hay—in my teeth.
L311146 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No. But I've got a penknife. 
L311145 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come.  Got a toothpick?
L311142 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Well, you've given me a very good example of the hiking—
L311141 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Hitch-hiking.
L311140 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
L311139 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.
L311138 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Really?
L311137 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
L311136 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What are you thinking about?
L311134 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Doesn't sound very exciting.
L311133 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter?
L311130 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Try me.
L311129 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Nothing.  Nothing you'd give two cents for.
L311128 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What?
L311127 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Sure.
L311120 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Holy Jumping Catfish! You can drive a guy crazy.
L311119 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ was so scared—that it scared—
L311118 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ But what!
L311117 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ was—but—
L311116 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Thought you were hungry!
L311115 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I don't want it now.
L311114 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Here. Eat your head off.
L311113 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ know—but—
L311112 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat.
L311111 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
L311110 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What's got into you?
L311109 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Oh, Peter— 
L311108 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What's the matter?
L311104 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ All right! Don't take them off. Do whatever you please. But shut up about it.
L311103 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What!
L311102 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Well, take them off.
L311101 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.
L311099 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Holy Smokes! Why did I ever get mixed up with you!
L311098 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
L311097 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ All right. You win. Let's forget it.
L311096 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Not if you're more hungry than scared.
L311095 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.
L311089 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What?
L311088 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Peter—
L311087 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I don't know about you, but I'm going to give a fairly good imitation of it.
L311086 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
L311085 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ This looks like the best spot.
L311080 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Show me a good "piggy-back" rider and I'll show you somebody that's human. Take Abraham Lincoln, for instance—a natural "piggy-backer."  Where do you get off with your stuffed-shirt family?  Why, your father knew so much about "piggy-back" riding that he—
L311079 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You're prejudiced.
L311078 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Not a one.
L311077 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
L311076 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxation—a warm heart—and a loving nature.
L311075 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ That's silly.
L311074 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I don't think there's a "piggy- back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" rider.
L311073 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ My uncle—Mother's brother—had four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
L311072 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
L311071 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Yes.
L311070 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ And he carried you like this, I suppose.
L311069 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride—
L311068 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You're crazy.
L311067 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Of course it is.
L311066 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ This isn't "piggy-back."
L311065 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
L311064 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I wish you'd stop being playful.
L311063 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Okay. Hang on to these.
L311062 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ No.
L311061 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Aren't you afraid of me?
L311060 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I'm following you.
L311059 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah.
L311058 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ To New York?
L311057 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
L311056 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
L311055 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
L311054 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You didn't give that boy all your money?
L311053 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
L311052 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Why, haven't you—?
L311051 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It takes money to buy food.
L311050 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What do you mean—starvation?
L311049 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
L311048 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Not as long as I'm alive.
L311047 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ First town we hit in the morning, you better wire your father.
L311046 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I don't trust that chatterbox.
L311045 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?
L311044 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What's the matter?
L311043 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!
L311042 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
L311041 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
