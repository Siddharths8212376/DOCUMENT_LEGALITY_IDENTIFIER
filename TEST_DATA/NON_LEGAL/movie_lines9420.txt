L543413 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ I'm afraid we can't let you go.
L543412 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ No deal.
L543347 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ You're talking about taking a life. The most unique life form on this planet. I think we're better than that.
L543346 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
L543345 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Then you're going to have to do it without me.
L543344 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ No, we don't.
L543343 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ That's the chance we have to take.
L543342 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear.
L543341 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him.
L543340 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ You're not hearing me.
L543339 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you.
L543338 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ Washington thinks it's too late for that.
L543337 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
L543336 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
L543335 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ What's all this for?
L543334 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ Shermin...
L543333 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Hello George.
L543140 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy.
L543139 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
L543138 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ Is that what's affecting your performance?
L543137 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
L543136 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ So far you've let it cross the heart of America. For two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security. I don't see the humor in that.
L543135 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
L543134 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
L543133 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
L543132 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.
L542889 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
L542888 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
L542887 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ We don't know what else to do. We need results.
L542886 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...
L542885 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
L542884 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ I don't like it, George...
L542883 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
L542882 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...
L542756 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ Oh shit!!!
L542755 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ The extraterrestrial now looks like this.
L542753 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
L542752 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ Clarify that.
L542751 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ It's taken on a disguise.
L542750 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ Why did you let it get into a populated area?
L542747 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Yes. It's kidnapped a woman at gunpoint and from what we can make out is forcing her to drive it somewhere.
L542746 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ It's in a green Mustang?
L542745 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
L542744 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ When can we expect containment?
L542743 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
L542629 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck.
L542628 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
L542627 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
L542626 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.
L542625 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
L542624 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
L542623 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
L542622 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Then it's not an accident that they found us.
L542595 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ What do you mean by 'contain?'
L542594 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ Contain it and get back to me.
L542593 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Wait, wait... What are my orders if we find this thing?
L542592 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
L542591 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here.
L542587 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Neither did I.
L542586 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
L542585 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...
L542584 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
L542583 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
L542582 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
L542581 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ It's real, George.
L543428 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ Watch it. They're coming out.
L543427 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ I won't let anyone hurt you.
L543402 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ Okay...
L543401 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
L543400 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
L543399 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
L543398 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ This is George Fox...
L543397 +++$+++ u3042 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ Mrs. Haydn...
L543224 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Is he on his way to Lathrop Wells?
L543223 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
L543222 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Mrs. Haydn...
L543221 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Do you know what you were kidnapped by?
L543220 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.
L543219 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Marc Shermin.
L543218 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?
L543215 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Get a highway patrol unit over there.
L543214 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
L543213 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
L543211 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
L543210 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
L543209 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
L543208 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
L543447 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ Goodbye.
L543446 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ I will.
L543445 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ Tell the baby about me.
L543443 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ No.
L543442 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ I'm never going to see you again, am I?
L543441 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ I love you.
L543440 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.'
L543439 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ What do I do now?
L543438 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ I must go.
L543437 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Well...
L543417 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ I said I would get you to your ship and that's where we're going to say goodbye.
L543416 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
L543415 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Where do you think you're going?
L543393 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ I will wave to you.
L543392 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
L543391 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ The yellow one.
L543390 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Where?
L543389 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ There.
L543386 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ No, thank you.
L543385 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ I'm sure we could find a country and western station.
L543383 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ Many, many days and nights...
L543382 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ How long will it take you to get home?
L543381 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Yes.
L543380 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ You want the baby to laugh at me.
L543379 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
L543378 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ I'd like to...
L543377 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ If you want to keep it, you can.
L543376 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ This is yours...
L543375 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ We can.
L543374 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ I will say that we can be friends.
L543373 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ What will you say about us?
L543372 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
L543371 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
L543370 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ I understand.
L543369 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
L543368 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
L543367 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
L543366 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ If I ever run into that guy, I'm going to kick his ass.
L543365 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ Yes.
L543364 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ The cook again?
L543363 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.
L543362 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
L543361 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ I want to get money for you and the baby.
L543360 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
L543359 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ I know how to gamble now.
L543358 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
L543357 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ I understand.  Thank you.
L543356 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.
L543355 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ I want to gamble.
L543354 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ What for?
L543353 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ May I have twenty-five cents, please?
L543350 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
L543349 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.
L543331 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ You will have this baby. If you want it. If you don't, I can stop it now.
L543330 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
L543329 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
L543328 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ But...
L543327 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
L543326 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Yes, they are.
L543325 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ They are beautiful.
L543324 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ I gave you a baby last night.
L543323 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Oh, you're pretty...
L543322 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ I understand.
L543321 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
L543320 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ Do they talk?!
L543319 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
L543318 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ No.
L543317 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ You don't forget anything, do you?
L543316 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ Horses.
L543315 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Good morning.
L543314 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Nothing.
L543313 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ What?
L543309 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ I do not get cold.
L543308 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ You're damn right I am.
L543307 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ You are cold.
L543305 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ We'll get a ride in the morning.
L543304 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
L543303 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
L543302 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
L543301 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
L543299 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ We're too far away to walk. Don't you understand?
L543298 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ You can stop. I will go on alone.
L543297 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ What are you saying?
L543296 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ What do you want from me? There are no cars on this road. I didn't ask for this stupid storm.
L543295 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ You promised.
L543294 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ I will. I will. We still have another day.
L543293 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ You promised you would get me to my ship.
L543292 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ No one's traveling in this weather.
L543291 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ I can't stay on this planet.
