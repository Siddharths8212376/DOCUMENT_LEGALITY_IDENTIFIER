L349262 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Get the inkling, Sam.  I'm getting tired of your attitude.
L349261 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No.
L349260 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?
L349237 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Don't touch me!  You can't touch me!
L349236 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I warned you yesterday.
L349235 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What are you doing?!
L349228 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Goodnight.
L349227 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Probably in the bible.
L349203 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I almost saw Catalina.
L349202 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Are you totally insane?!
L349184 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You can't even begins to know how much I hate my father.  Think of it as a family tradition.
L349183 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'll hate you forever.
L349182 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
L349181 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ If you hit me, I'll call the police.
L349180 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too.  And there's no make-up at my house.  No glue sniffing.  Huffing. No pills, no grass.
L349173 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Mom...please.
L349172 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You don't have a choice.
L349171 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm not going!
L349168 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You have everything?
L349167 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Mom, tell him I'm not going.  You already promised me!
L349166 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'll get your bag.
L349165 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm not going!
L349164 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You'll know me by the time we're through.
L349163 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
L349154 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No I'm not!
L349153 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Did you tell him he's spending the summer with me?
L349150 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
L349149 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Because I live there.
L349148 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Why would you be there?
L349147 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'll be around to check up on you.
L349146 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ To check up on me?
L349145 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
L349051 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Isn't that weird?  I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years.  Six years.  I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me.
L349050 +++$+++ u1802 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ No.  A friend... your mother?  Everybody gets touched by someone they love.
L349049 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
L349048 +++$+++ u1802 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.
L349047 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I haven't been touched in years.
L349046 +++$+++ u1802 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ Good for you.
L349045 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I can die trying.
L349044 +++$+++ u1802 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ Can you build a house in four months?
L349043 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Stage four pancreatic cancer.  They haven't even pretended to offer treatment.  You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
L349042 +++$+++ u1802 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ No one's really said four months is all you have, have they?
L349040 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You know what mortise and tenon is?
L349039 +++$+++ u1802 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ What kind of house?
L349038 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'd build a house.
L349037 +++$+++ u1802 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ What would you do?
L349036 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Good for you.
L349035 +++$+++ u1802 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ I'd eat a lot of red meat.
L349915 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't let him.  He just loves to.
L349914 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
L349892 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I want you to find someone for me.
L349891 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ God, you look like crap, George.
L349890 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I need you to do me a favor.
L349889 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ It's my day off.  I thought I'd help with the plumbing.
L349352 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
L349351 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ I'm surprised he hasn't left.
L349342 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
L349341 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
L349339 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ I know there's an explanation.
L349338 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Ah!  Oh....
L348933 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ At least your father tried, George.
L348932 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Thanks for telling me.
L348931 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
L348930 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it!  I can't afford dirt in this town.  I live in Riverside, Goddammitt  And you get to piss in the ocean.
L348929 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
L348928 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ Left you this place.
L348927 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Was bankrupt and dead before I was twenty.
L348922 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you.
L348921 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I aimed high.
L349826 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ I don't even care if he ever comes back.
L349825 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ She's a little sad, is all.
L349824 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Because Dad left?
L349823 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ She needs to be alone, I think.
L349822 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ It's okay.
L349821 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Oh.  Sorry.
L349820 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ I just wanted to know where Mom was?
L349596 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Three.
L349595 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ How many bedrooms will your house have?
L349854 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Not a perfect day.
L349853 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I better get the kids home.
L349846 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm an idiot to have you up there.
L349845 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Don't move!
L349802 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It's not my back that's killing me.
L349801 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Are you going to kiss me?
L349800 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ So could I.
L349799 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I could die.
L349792 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What?
L349791 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Back.  Neck.  Back.
L349787 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ 'I'll be in the bedroom.'
L349786 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What did he say?
L349785 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ No goodbye.  No fuck you.  No 'Are you in love with George?'
L349784 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Left you?
L349783 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Peter left me yesterday.
L349782 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ No.  Mostly me.
L349781 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
L349780 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I didn't think you'd come today.
L349779 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Is your back still killing you?
L349695 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You need to know what?  Do I still love you?
L349694 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I need to know.
L349693 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Let's not do this, okay?
L349692 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ If I weren't married?
L349691 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You bit my finger.
L349690 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I'm married.
L349689 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I can't pick you up.
L349688 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ It sounded like a pick-up line.
L349687 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.
L349686 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ You've never said that before.
L349685 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ That was the truth.
L349684 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
L349683 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What did I say?
L349682 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
L349681 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Going on?
L349680 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Nothing is going on with us, is it?
L349677 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I can hire workers to help me.
L349676 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I thought we were helping.
L349675 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'd rather you not be here.
L349674 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us?  She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing!  What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there!  He's not there!  And when he is, he isn't!  So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George.  I'll stop coming.  But it won't be because of Peter.  It'll be because you asked me to stop.  Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it.
L349673 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ What is it with this?  They wouldn't spend less time with Peter if they lived here!  He has no time!
L349672 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
L349671 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
L349670 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It's just that there's less that Adam and Ryan can do anymore.  I'd hate to have them bored.
L349669 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
L349668 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
L349546 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.
L349545 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Let's see if you've gotten any better.
L349541 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Watch out for the smile, boys.
L349540 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I smiled at him.
L349539 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Tell him how you made me fall in love with you.
L349536 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ This was my very first slow dance.
L349535 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It's been a while.
L349509 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I think so.
L349508 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Do you need help?
L349507 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You're a good mother.
L349506 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
L349505 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'll find something that won't kill them.
L349504 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
L349503 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You brought your kids?
L349502 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ He won't use my shower.  I don't get it.
L349501 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Where's Sam?
L349500 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ No, I'm...thanks.  I took something.
L349499 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Do you need anything?  I'll go to the pharmacy.  I have some Demerol at home.
L349498 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ My stupid back.
L349497 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I thought you'd be up with the sun.
L349401 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ You're not well.
L349400 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ With your hands or your tongue?
L349398 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Hindsight.  It's like foresight without a future.
L349397 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I've been wrong a lot in my life.
L349395 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
L349394 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Go in there and lick his attitude.
L349393 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.
L349392 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Oh...with his ear infection!
L349391 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
L349390 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
L349389 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.
L349388 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Finished or unfinished?
L349387 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I dreamed about your house last night.
L349386 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It's not breakfast yet.
L349295 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I'm fine.  Nothing.  I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.
L349294 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What is it?
L349292 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ We have it on video!  Was that when?  My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.
L349291 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You head was pressed against my chest.  I could feel your heart racing.  And I remember I kissed your hair.
L349290 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ The only time I can think of for sure, I was holding onto Sam in the ocean, saving him from the waves.
L349289 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Do you remember?
L349288 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
L349287 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ What have you been before today?
L349286 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today.
L349281 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Sam's favorite.
L349280 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
L349279 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ The first and the last.
L349278 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Which?
L349277 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
L349276 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ But you hated four out of the five you did.
L349275 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I used to live here.
L349274 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What?
L349273 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ It makes me sad.
L349272 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Well, for later then.
L349271 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.
L349175 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe.  If he leaves, I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring.  He can hate me.  You can hate me.  He can try to kill me while I sleep.  You can call the police.  You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending the summer with me.  He's my son.  He's sixteen.  That's it.
L349174 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ George --
L349170 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Let's go.
L349169 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I did say he could go.
L349162 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
