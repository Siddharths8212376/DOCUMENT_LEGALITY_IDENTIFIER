L100893 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Let's get going.  Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here.
L100892 +++$+++ u4193 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Tia ain't a chick.  She's family.  And don't forget it.
L100890 +++$+++ u4193 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Pat's right.  It'll be fun.
L100889 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --
L100888 +++$+++ u4193 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ You soundin' like the old man now.
L100885 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.
L100884 +++$+++ u4193 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ You want us to move in here?
L100842 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Naw.  I think it's... I dunno.  Something about it just buzzes me.
L100841 +++$+++ u4193 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Damn.  That is the ugliest building I have ever seen.
L100839 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
L100838 +++$+++ u4193 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Looks like a damn graveyard round here.
L101016 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ Yeah, and it took some doing to get out of there.  Just be glad I did and you can start life from here instead of down there.
L101015 +++$+++ u4193 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ But that's your old hood, Pops.
L101014 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ Clean your mouth, or I will.  Those boys had no business messing down there.  Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get.
L101013 +++$+++ u4193 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ That's some terrible shit.
L101012 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ That's what?
L100983 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ You wouldn't know a mule if it bit you in the ass. And personally, I don't need a mule.  I got a Lexus.  And nobody gave it to me --
L100982 +++$+++ u4193 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
L100981 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.
L101308 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Bones.
L101307 +++$+++ u4205 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ STANK +++$+++ Wh-wh-whooo?
L101306 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ You tell my old friend Mackie, I'll be seeing him.  Soon.  Real soon.
L101302 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Big Bad Eddie Mack?  Got shit for brains and that's a fack.  Hey-heh...
L101301 +++$+++ u4205 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ STANK +++$+++ Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
L101300 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
L101299 +++$+++ u4205 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ STANK +++$+++ Looking to score?
L101204 +++$+++ u4199 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MACK +++$+++ Go on.  It won't kill you.
L101203 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ I said, no thanks.
L101202 +++$+++ u4199 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MACK +++$+++ Just try it.
L101201 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.
L101200 +++$+++ u4199 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MACK +++$+++ Ain't no big thang.  It's just a po' man's free base.  Here, check it out.
L101199 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Those 'fools' are my people.
L101198 +++$+++ u4199 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MACK +++$+++ Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
L101197 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag.
L101196 +++$+++ u4199 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MACK +++$+++ It ain't the money - it's the high.  The big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So you never have to pay out.
L101195 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ What else?  Money.
L101191 +++$+++ u4199 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MACK +++$+++ But things change.  You gotta think ahead.
L101190 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
L101189 +++$+++ u4199 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MACK +++$+++ You got a nice crib here.
L101187 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ What it will be.
L101186 +++$+++ u4199 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ MACK +++$+++ Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?
L101438 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Hush, baby.
L101437 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ But.
L101436 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Where we'll always be...
L101435 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ Where are we, baby?
L101430 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ What?
L101429 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ I want you to do something for me, baby.
L101428 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ I've got what I want.  Turn around baby, look at me.  Look at your man.
L101427 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ Jimmy, you've got --
L101313 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ No.  Not...not you.  You I forgive.
L101312 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ No?  That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now?  Kill us? Kill us all?
L101182 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ I don't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese, or rip you open and eat you right here.
L101181 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Gotta be an in-ey and gotta be smooth. If it's ragged, it was picked too soon. Won't ever be ripe.  Second, it's got to have just a little give, here.  At the edges.  And last, but not very far from least...  You gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood, looooong sniff.
L100968 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Don't you worry about a thing.  This hand's gonna be stroking the back of your neck tonight.
L100967 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now.
L100966 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
L100965 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ Left hand's the past.  Your right's the present.  And the future.  But it's not written in stone.  It's written in flesh and blood.  And flesh and blood will change.  See?  There's something here, a new line, right across your life line.
L100963 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
L100962 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
L100961 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ All that shinin' and "reader and adviser" mess.  That was your mama's bag.  I don't know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise.
L100960 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ Let me see your hand.
L100959 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
L100958 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
L101415 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Then fuck it!!!
L101414 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ You know I can't.
L101413 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
L101412 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy!
L101408 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ No brother.  I wouldn'ta.  I never done a man - any man.  Let alone a brother like that.  Course, as you can see, no good deed goes unfucked.  Now the question is, if the good get fucked, what we got saved up for the bad?  You about to find out.
L101407 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ Wait, Jimmy.  Think about it.  You woulda done the same thing if you was me.
L101406 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ And the hell everybody else, right?
L101405 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
L101404 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ I don't understand it.  You were my Man. Since we was grasshoppas.  I always looked after you.  You had a piece of everything I had.
L101382 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Time like this, is that what you really want to know?  How I got the fuck in here?
L101381 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ How did you get in here?
L101380 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ What it will be.
L101225 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ You always told me, it's a dog eat dog world.
L101224 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Since we was just grasshoppers...
L101223 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ Sorry, my brother.
L101210 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ I don't need to hear the deal.  I don't need any partners.  I don't need new product.  And I sure as hell don't need this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face.
L101209 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ Everybody just be cool.  Jimmy, man, I think you oughtta hear the deal.
L101185 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ We met.
L101184 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you?
L100957 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ That's your dream, Homes.  Not mine.  I don't want to leave this street.  Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me.
L100956 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
L100955 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
L100954 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
L100953 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
L100952 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ It's all arranged for tonight.  Eddie Mack's gonna be there.  And Offisa Korruptsky, too.
L100951 +++$+++ u4194 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ BONES +++$+++ Go easy on Jay Bird.  I can remember when we was his age...
L100950 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ 'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun.  Get back on the curb!  Now!
L101403 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ My God.  My dress.  We have to find it. And burn it.  And shut the door.
L101402 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ In his grave there was a cloth or a dress or something.  Covered with blood.
L101371 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ Mother!  No.
L101370 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ Told you so.  Alright.  We tried.  Let's go home.
L101364 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ Girl, they build gates like that to keep people like us out.
L101363 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
L101362 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ We'll have to sneak in.
L101332 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ Fine.  Maybe I got nothing to lose. 'Cept you.
L101331 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
L101330 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
L101329 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ Aren't you gonna do something about it?
L101328 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ Eddie Mack, that cop.  And Jeremiah.  And even when he's done, who knows.  He won't be satisfied.  Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more.  Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied.
L101327 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ Who?
L101326 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ He'll kill them.  He'll kill every last one of them.
L101276 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ But how do you know?  Maybe he just wanted to see us?  And now he's gone again.  And you've all killed my father for the second time.
L101275 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
L101274 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
L101273 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ You got his hands.  Beautiful hands.  I didn't even know.  That night.  When they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me.  Life's like that. Grows right out of death.
L101271 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ Your father.  He was your father.
L101270 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ Who?  Who is he?  What is he?
L101269 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
L101268 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
L101267 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ It's alright, baby.
L101238 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ You said bad things hurt places.  So maybe good things heal them.  Good things are happening here.  Maybe for the first time ever.  And maybe that's all it takes.
L101237 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ Please.  It's for your own good.
L101236 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ All the more reason I should be here.
L101235 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ I lied.
L101234 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ You said the vision, the images.  They're just that.  Just pictures.  They can't hurt you.  That's what you always said.
L101233 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ ...I've seen things.  In there.  Last night.  You did too.  Don't tell me you didn't.  You were crying like a baby.
L101082 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ Just a bad place.  And the doorway to worse.
L101081 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ And what's that?
L101080 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ Maybe once upon a time.  But that was long ago.  Back before... before it became what it is.
L101079 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ Have you ever been inside?
L101078 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
L101077 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
L101076 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
L101075 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ I'm sorry, Momma.  Maybe next time.
L101074 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ You mean as opposed to your life?
L101073 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
L101072 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ I have to finish this for class.
L101071 +++$+++ u4202 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PEARL +++$+++ Aren't you going to join us?
L101475 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ I can't!
L101474 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ We gotta jump!
L101456 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Here!
L101455 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ I can't find you.
L101454 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Here, find my hand.  The stairs are right near here.  I saw them.  Let's just walk up there.
L101453 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Okay, okay.  Listen:
L101452 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ Patrick, he's...
L101451 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Bill!  Bill?!
L101450 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ I'm here.
L101376 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ My old man calls the shots.  He built that gate and these damn walls.
L101375 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?
L101140 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.
L101139 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
L101138 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ It's alright.  If you want to go home...
L101137 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ I can't.  Not yet.
L101134 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I'm sure I can make your mother like me. But then do I gotta worry 'bout your father?
L101133 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ He probably thinks he's saving you from something.  I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
L101132 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.
L101131 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ She doesn't want me here.  With you.  In this house.
L101126 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ What?  Oh yeah.  Coming.
L101125 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Cinn?
L101034 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ If I did, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door.
L101033 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ And you believe her?
L101032 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
L101031 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ The dead get out?
L101030 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
L101029 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Lucky thing.
L101028 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
L101027 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?
L101026 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ My momma says every house is two houses. Every street, two streets.  There's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one.  The city of the dead.
L101025 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S.  And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
L101024 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.
L101023 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ What else does she say?
L101022 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ No.  It goes way back.  Or so my Momma says.
L101021 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Why?
L101020 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ That place is already bad luck.
L101019 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Careful.  That's bad luck.
L100925 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Anytime.  Be seeing you.
L100924 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ Guess it's not Rossmore Park.  Thanks for the help.
L100919 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I manage them.
L100918 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ How do you know?
L100917 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
L100916 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ Are they on the radio?
L100911 +++$+++ u4195 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ CINNABAR +++$+++ You moved into this block?
L100910 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ no really, let us help.  We're new in the neighborhood, gonna be neighbors.
L100806 +++$+++ u4196 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Fuck it.  Alright.
L100805 +++$+++ u4205 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ STANK +++$+++ Don't worry.  It's just round the corner. Halfway down that block, you can't miss it.  Top step of the front stairs, there's a loose stone.  Go on, I ain't shitting you.
L100804 +++$+++ u4205 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ STANK +++$+++ I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up yourself.
L100803 +++$+++ u4196 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Where is it?
L100802 +++$+++ u4205 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ STANK +++$+++ Let me see it.
L100801 +++$+++ u4196 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Let me see it.
L100800 +++$+++ u4205 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ STANK +++$+++ Yeah, but you got to come the rest of the way on foot.  Leave your car and walk over here.
L100799 +++$+++ u4196 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ You got the shit?
L100798 +++$+++ u4205 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ STANK +++$+++ You got the cash?
L100797 +++$+++ u4205 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ STANK +++$+++ Back here.  At the end of the block.
L100796 +++$+++ u4196 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ We're here.  Where the hell are you?
L101465 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Daddy?
L101464 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ Help me.  I'm so sorry.  But please, help me...
L101463 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Dad?
L101462 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ Please...help me...
L101298 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Dead?  I don't think your past is dead.  It's alive.  And it bites.
L101297 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ That's the past.  It's dead.
L101296 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
L101295 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ You were just a kid.
L101294 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
L101293 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
L101292 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Why?  Why did you give a shit about the building?  Why did you care that we were there of all places?
L101291 +++$+++ u4201 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ From what?
L101290 +++$+++ u4197 +++$+++ m280 +++$+++ JEREMIAH +++$+++ I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
