L488702 +++$+++ u7495 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ ROMAN +++$+++ My movie.
L488701 +++$+++ u7496 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ What?  What movie?
L488700 +++$+++ u7495 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ ROMAN +++$+++ It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
L488699 +++$+++ u7496 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
L488698 +++$+++ u7495 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ ROMAN +++$+++ It is in my script.
L488697 +++$+++ u7496 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Roman that's not the line.
L488696 +++$+++ u7495 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ ROMAN +++$+++ It's Sarah.
L488695 +++$+++ u7496 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I'm hanging up right now.
L488694 +++$+++ u7495 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ ROMAN +++$+++ But you know my favorite name?
L488693 +++$+++ u7496 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
L488692 +++$+++ u7495 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ ROMAN +++$+++ Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
L488691 +++$+++ u7496 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
L488690 +++$+++ u7495 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ ROMAN +++$+++ Who's this?
L488689 +++$+++ u7496 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Who's this?
L488688 +++$+++ u7495 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ ROMAN +++$+++ Hello.
L488687 +++$+++ u7496 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?
L488686 +++$+++ u7495 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ ROMAN +++$+++ Page 22, Candy's big moment.
L488685 +++$+++ u7496 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Huh, fine.
L488684 +++$+++ u7495 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ ROMAN +++$+++ Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
L488683 +++$+++ u7496 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
L488682 +++$+++ u7495 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ ROMAN +++$+++ You're not happy with your part.
L488681 +++$+++ u7496 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!
L488680 +++$+++ u7495 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ ROMAN +++$+++ All right, since I got you on the phone, let's talk about your character.
L488679 +++$+++ u7496 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Oh it's no problem, I'm just... looking at your   music video awards.
L488678 +++$+++ u7495 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ ROMAN +++$+++ Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
L488677 +++$+++ u7496 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Oh shit.  Hello? Director's office.
L488674 +++$+++ u7496 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
L488673 +++$+++ u7499 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ TYSON +++$+++ No.
L488672 +++$+++ u7496 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?
L488671 +++$+++ u7499 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ TYSON +++$+++ Roman and everybody else went home for the night. I'm here for a make-up test.
L488593 +++$+++ u7499 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ TYSON +++$+++ I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
L488592 +++$+++ u7496 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
L488591 +++$+++ u7499 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ TYSON +++$+++ SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
L488590 +++$+++ u7496 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
L488585 +++$+++ u7499 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ TYSON +++$+++ And still the film is Number One at the box office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty and Arlington Street.
L488584 +++$+++ u7496 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these re-writes. It's like every five minutes there's a new script. God, and you just know this all because of STAB 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.
L489109 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.
L489108 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this.
L489107 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I thought you wanted me here?
L489106 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
L489105 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Alright, I'm here. Now what?
L489104 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there.
L489103 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Yeah?
L489101 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ I'll call you, when you're on your way.
L489100 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ WHERE?
L489099 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
L489098 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Where?
L489093 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!
L489092 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ You're dead!
L489088 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Are real?  How do you know you're not hearing things? How do you know I'm not someone in your head? Somewhere, you know.
L489087 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ How do I know their voices are --
L489086 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.
L489085 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Go there.
L489084 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Yes.
L489083 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Don't do it!  If you do one thing to attract attention, one thing, I'll kill them both. Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?
L489081 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ The question isn't who I am.  The question is, who's with me.
L489080 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Who is this?
L489079 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ { a click } I only her you too, Sidney.
L488663 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
L488662 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
L488661 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ No. We play in my court this time. Come to Hollywood. STAB 3's going to cutting corners cast-wise.  And I've got my eyes set on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly.
L488660 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ The final act? Well let's play asshole!
L488659 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.
L488658 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.
L488657 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.
L488656 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
L488655 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
L488654 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ W-what do you want?
L488653 +++$+++ u7500 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
L488651 +++$+++ u7501 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ It's mother, Sidney, now be a good girl and turn on the news. DO IT!
L488650 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Who the fuck is this?
L488649 +++$+++ u7501 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?
L488648 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I'm sorry, your voice.
L488647 +++$+++ u7501 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ No I need to call you. Just you.
L488646 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Well then the people you need to call are the police.
L488645 +++$+++ u7501 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
L488644 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Are you sure?
L488643 +++$+++ u7501 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Laura I think I just killed somebody.
L488642 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
L488641 +++$+++ u7501 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Hello?
L487514 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep.
L487513 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!
L487507 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Where the fuck did she go?
L487506 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
L487503 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
L487502 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ She can't get both of us.
L487499 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ She looked dead. Still does.
L487498 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I thought she was dead.
L487495 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ No, it's not.
L487494 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ It's on the table.
L487492 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
L487491 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.
L487488 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these days -- you gotta have a sequel.
L487487 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
L487486 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
L487485 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...
L487477 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Yeah...
L487476 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Ready?
L487475 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ You know what time it is, Sid? It's after midnight. It's your mother's anniversary. We killed her exactly one year ago today.
L487474 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got it all figured out. Why do you think we kept your father alive so long? Why did we save you for last?
L487472 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die -- those are the rules.
L487471 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.
L487465 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid.
L487464 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Nope.
L487461 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
L487460 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
L487456 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ And if you get it right -- you die.
L487455 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
L487454 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night.
L487444 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Oh yeah.
L487443 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn.
L487307 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
L487306 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Dude. What are you doing here?
L487165 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ You know it.
L487164 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ You ready to party hard tonight?
L487163 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Oh...
L487162 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
L487161 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
L487160 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Duh... that's quick.
L487159 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
L487158 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
L487157 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Piece of cake. She'll be there.
L487156 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ How'd you do?
L487050 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Sorry.
L487049 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
L487048 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Owwww...
L486805 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ No one's saying you did.
L486804 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ I didn't kill anybody.
L486787 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Sorry.
L486786 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ It's called tact, you fuckrag.
L486785 +++$+++ u7516 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ What? She asked.
L486920 +++$+++ u7514 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SHERIFF BURKE +++$+++ We're gonna have to keep you, Billy. The governor's got SBI, FBI, and god knows who else on their way down here.
L486919 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.
L486918 +++$+++ u7514 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SHERIFF BURKE +++$+++ Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?
L486915 +++$+++ u7514 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SHERIFF BURKE +++$+++ And last night? Sidney said you crawled through her window last night too?
L486914 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L486913 +++$+++ u7514 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SHERIFF BURKE +++$+++ You rode your bike out there?
L486912 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I just wanted to see her, that's all.
L486911 +++$+++ u7514 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SHERIFF BURKE +++$+++ Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?
L487518 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.
L487517 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.
L487511 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
L487510 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ You bitch -- where the fuck are you?
L487509 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Are you alone in the house?
L487508 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Hello?
L487483 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Got the ending figured out yet? Time's running out.
L487482 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Stop it!
L487481 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Jesus... fuck, that hurt.
L487467 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.
L487466 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I don't understand...
L487463 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
L487462 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Why did you kill my mother?
L487453 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ We already played that game. You lost, remember?
L487452 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Fuck you.
L487451 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
L487434 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ It's okay. Give me the gun.
L487433 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ NO! Don't believe him.
L487430 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
L487429 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I thought you were...
L487379 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you.
L487378 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ You don't still think it was me?
L487377 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L487376 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
L487375 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
L487374 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I called my dad.
L487373 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
L487372 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ What?
L487371 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Who did you call?
L487337 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Yeah... I think so.
L487336 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Are you serious?
L487335 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ You heard me.
L487334 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ What?
L487333 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Or even a good porno.
L487332 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Sshh... it's okay.
L487330 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
L487329 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I wanna let go. I do...
L487328 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
L487327 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ But this is life. This isn't a movie.
L487326 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
L487325 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
L487324 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Oh Sidney...
L487323 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...
L487322 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ But you're right -- enough is enough. I can't wallow in the grief process forever and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was.
L487321 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ You lost your mom...
L487320 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
L487319 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
L487318 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ So...
L487311 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ It's okay. We need to talk.
L487310 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.
L487070 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ You have to move on, Sid.
L487069 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
L487068 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
L487067 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
L487066 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ It's been a year since she died.
L487065 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
L487064 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
L487063 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ No...
L487062 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
L487061 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ You know that's not true.
L487060 +++$+++ u7502 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
