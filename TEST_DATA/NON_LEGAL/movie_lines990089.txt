L358598 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.
L358597 +++$+++ u6400 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Peter, you're now writing a book about the Viznick case.  You seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers.  I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers?
L358596 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Thanks for having me, Sally.
L358595 +++$+++ u6400 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter.
L358937 +++$+++ u6401 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ Had to let her go.  I see you thinkin' there, superstar. Don't.
L358936 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Where is she now?
L358935 +++$+++ u6401 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ We hauled her in earlier but didn't have anything hard to tie her to Townsend. Far as the priest goes, he won't be bothering you.  Suffered a complete mental breakdown, during - get this - during an exorcism.
L358934 +++$+++ u6401 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ Not what the records show.  Anyway, she was a runaway, arrests for vandalism, petty theft, drugs, the whole bit. Parole records show she graduated from community college, moved into a retreat house, teaches some classes at the seminary school, hasn't been in any trouble since.
L358933 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ She told me she killed them.
L358932 +++$+++ u6401 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion.
L358931 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What happened?
L358930 +++$+++ u6401 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ Yeah, murder-suicide.
L358929 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Parents died?
L358928 +++$+++ u6401 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans.  Parents died when she was 13.
L358927 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ She came to me with a wild story about demonic possession.
L358924 +++$+++ u6401 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ You got the right attitude, anyway, look, we gotta talk.
L358923 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
L358922 +++$+++ u6401 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ How're you doin' today?
L358921 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What's up?
L358885 +++$+++ u6401 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ Hey, don't thank me.  Somebody up there likes you.
L358884 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Thanks again for everything.
L358881 +++$+++ u6401 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ Sure thing.  Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  You can go home.  Gimme til morning.  Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh?  Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.
L358880 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Thanks for handling this.
L358813 +++$+++ u6401 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ I'll quit, maybe you should start.
L358812 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ He could see me.
L358811 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ He's looking right at me.
L358810 +++$+++ u6401 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ What's the matter with you?
L358806 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You're too old to smoke.  Won't be able to shoot hoops with your grandkid.
L358805 +++$+++ u6401 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.
L358804 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Seems George isn't making too many friends in lockup.
L358594 +++$+++ u6401 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.
L358593 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What's this?
L358592 +++$+++ u6401 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ Yeah, yeah.  I've heard it before.  Just be sure you spell my name right.  Nine o'clock?
L358591 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
L358590 +++$+++ u6401 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem.
L358589 +++$+++ u6401 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ Yeah, right.  I don't know why I bothered inviting you guys.  I knew you wouldn't show.
L358588 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
L358587 +++$+++ u6401 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ Hey!  Mr. big shot.
L360177 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you.
L360176 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L360109 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ It mattered, Mom.
L360108 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
L360107 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ That's all you cared about.  I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.
L360103 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ What's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers.
L360102 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ That's ridiculous.
L360101 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
L360100 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ I don't remember that.
L360099 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table.  And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.
L360098 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
L360097 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ That's not it.
L360096 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
L360095 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.
L360094 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
L360093 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
L360092 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
L360091 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
L360090 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
L360089 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ No I don't.
L360088 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
L360087 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?
L360086 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
L360085 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ There you go.
L360084 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Don't curse.
L360083 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
L360082 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
L360081 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Whatever.
L360080 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
L360079 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ So what do I do?
L360077 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Maybe she is.
L360076 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
L360075 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Yeah, you met her?
L360074 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ To that stewardess?
L360073 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Engaged.
L360072 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ How is he?
L360071 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Yeah.  Can't wait to see him  I just saw Quincy.
L360070 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ I can manage.
L360069 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Need any help?
L360068 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Hi.
L359922 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game.
L359921 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ What?
L359918 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ He's still at the bank.
L359917 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Dad around?
L359916 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Don't be defensive.  I'm just surprised to see you.
L359915 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
L359914 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Monica.  What are you doing here?
L359558 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Tonight, don't worry about yesterday's game, the recruiters, or anything else. I just want you to enjoy being beautiful. Will you do that?
L359557 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ What?
L359548 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Nothing.  So good luck.
L359547 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ What?
L359546 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do.
L359545 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.
L359544 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Child, take a bite.
L359543 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I can't eat before a game.
L359542 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Taste this.
L359400 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Watch your mouth.
L359399 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...
L359398 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ That's not funny
L359397 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I won't.  I'm a lesbian.
L359396 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
L359395 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ nothing.
L359342 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Pants.
L359341 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
L359340 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I hate it.
L359339 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.
L359338 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Ah, Mom.
L359332 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Oh, all that work.
L359331 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Nothing.
L359330 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Monica, what did you do?
L359350 +++$+++ u6411 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Thanks, sweetheart.
L359349 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Okay.
L359348 +++$+++ u6411 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ You sure?
L359347 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ The blue.
L359346 +++$+++ u6411 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Which one for tomorrow?
L359272 +++$+++ u6411 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Camille, she'll be fine.
L359271 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ How is she alright looking the way she does?
L359270 +++$+++ u6411 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ She's alright.
L359269 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
L360173 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Okay.
L360172 +++$+++ u6409 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ He's fine.
L360171 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold.
L360170 +++$+++ u6409 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
L360169 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ So you're still breast-feeding?
L359394 +++$+++ u6409 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ What'd you do?
L359393 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ So that means it's alright for you to act like that?
L359387 +++$+++ u6409 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ But you use potato?
L359386 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ ...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour.
L359345 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ I just need to lay down.  I've been running around all day.
L359344 +++$+++ u6409 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ Are you okay?
L359343 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?
L359305 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Really?  Well, come on, then.
L359304 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.
L359303 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older, it's definitely something I want to do.  Since you love to cook, maybe it's something we can talk about.
L359302 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ You're a caterer?
L359301 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
L359300 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
L359299 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.
L359298 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ Okay?
L359297 +++$+++ u6404 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
L359296 +++$+++ u6412 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NONA +++$+++ ...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
L359820 +++$+++ u6405 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ COACH MILLER +++$+++ You think I'd go hoarse for a player with no potential?   When I ignore you, that's when you worry.  Go get dressed.
L359819 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
L359818 +++$+++ u6405 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ COACH MILLER +++$+++ What?
L359816 +++$+++ u6405 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ COACH MILLER +++$+++ You want the job or not?
L359815 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
L359814 +++$+++ u6405 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ COACH MILLER +++$+++ We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again.
L359813 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Thanks.
L359812 +++$+++ u6405 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ COACH MILLER +++$+++ You could've given up after you threw that ball away.  But you kept your head and you showed real heart.
L359672 +++$+++ u6405 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ COACH MILLER +++$+++ I want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because I don't ever want to see it again, you hear me?  Dora, take her spot.
L359671 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Coach...
L359670 +++$+++ u6405 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ COACH MILLER +++$+++ You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
L359669 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ What?
L359640 +++$+++ u6405 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ COACH MILLER +++$+++ This time get your feet set.
L359639 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I can take it.
L359604 +++$+++ u6406 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Shh.  It's okay.
L359603 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Wait...
L359602 +++$+++ u6406 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Your sister told me hands off, but I can't help myself...
L359601 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L359600 +++$+++ u6406 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ That was nice.
L359586 +++$+++ u6406 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Then I'll get you some punch.
L359585 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ My mouth is kinda dry.
L359584 +++$+++ u6406 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I mean, I'm having a good time with you...
L359583 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Sorry.
L359582 +++$+++ u6406 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ That was two words.
L359581 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Huh?
L359580 +++$+++ u6406 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Careful.
L359579 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Sort of.
L359578 +++$+++ u6406 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I'm an English major.  You like English?
L359564 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Oh, sorry.
L359563 +++$+++ u6406 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ No, I mean I can check it for you.
L359562 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ You're cold?
L359561 +++$+++ u6406 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Can I take your coat?
L359426 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ I'd love for him to get a good education.  That's it.
L359425 +++$+++ u6407 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
L359424 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ Gotta wait til the press conference.
L359423 +++$+++ u6407 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You could make a career by telling me where.
L359422 +++$+++ u6416 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.
L359421 +++$+++ u6407 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Quincy, word has it you might make the jump the NBA.
L360127 +++$+++ u6408 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ KYRA +++$+++ Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive.  You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.

L360125 +++$+++ u6408 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ KYRA +++$+++ You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
L360124 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ I don't know sometimes.
L360123 +++$+++ u6408 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ KYRA +++$+++ To do what you love.
L360122 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
L360121 +++$+++ u6408 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ KYRA +++$+++ Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it.
L360120 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ You might be the only one with a job.
L360119 +++$+++ u6408 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ KYRA +++$+++ Why not?
L360118 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Nah.
L360117 +++$+++ u6408 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ KYRA +++$+++ Four days.
L360116 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ So how long is this trip?
L360114 +++$+++ u6408 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ KYRA +++$+++ Get used to it, babe.
L360113 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ I don't wanna see that.
L360112 +++$+++ u6408 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ KYRA +++$+++ What?
L360111 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Damn, girl.

L360064 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ It means a lot that you came by.
L360059 +++$+++ u6408 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ KYRA +++$+++ Monica.  You grew up together, right? Quincy's told me about you.
L360058 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...
L360057 +++$+++ u6408 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ KYRA +++$+++ Hello.
