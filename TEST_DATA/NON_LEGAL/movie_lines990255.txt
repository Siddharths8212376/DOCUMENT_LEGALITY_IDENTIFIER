L480769 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
L480768 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
L480767 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What was?
L480766 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ It was sinking.
L480726 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ How do you know?
L480725 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I know.
L480724 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
L480723 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
L480722 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.
L480676 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Go to sleep.
L480675 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Jed's got cables.
L480674 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Whose show was this on?
L480673 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff.  When they're having sex.
L480672 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What?
L480671 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Will she scratch up your back?
L480670 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What do you think?
L480669 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?
L480668 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm starting to notice that.
L480667 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ It doesn't.  They ask you.
L480666 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
L480665 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ -- a slice of pizza --
L480664 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or --
L480663 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ English muffin.  How do you do it?
L480662 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
L480661 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Dad, you're not taking this seriously.
L480660 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ She looks like my third grade teacher.  I hated my third grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait a minute! She <u>is</u> my third grade teacher!
L480659 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ She's willing to fly anywhere.
L480658 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  I am not going to think about it.  Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --
L480657 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Somewhere in the middle.
L480656 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
L480655 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --
L480654 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
L480653 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?
L480652 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.
L480651 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ How did they get our phone number?
L480650 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
L480649 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
L480626 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Right.  I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm sorry.
L480625 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Stressed.
L480624 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I'm just --
L480621 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I think I know how to have a spice rack.
L480620 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
L480619 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Sure.  Looking good.
L480618 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ So I can go.
L480617 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Fine.  Fine.
L480616 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Jed is having a slumber party New Year's Eve and he invited me.
L480615 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
L480614 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ I forgot to mention.  Jed called --
L480613 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What?
L480612 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ P.  Dad?
L480611 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Does red pepper go under R or P?
L480606 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Dad --
L480605 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
L480604 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ No, I'm not, but --
L480603 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Oh, you're changing your mind --
L480602 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Dad, I don't know about this one --
L480554 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You're right.  You better hope so.
L480553 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Nobody else is going to know it was us.
L480552 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What?!
L480551 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ It plays in 50 states.
L480550 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
L480549 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ My feelings exactly.
L480548 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Not.
L480538 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Right.
L480537 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ It's never happening again. Right?
L480536 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Dad?  About last night?
L480534 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ We desperately need a spice rack.  Desperately.
L480533 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ It's a spice rack.
L480532 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --
L480493 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't think I have to now.
L480492 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.
L480463 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ There's somebody on the phone for you.  His name is Sam.
L480462 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What is it?
L480461 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Dad --
L480943 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ I think they're announcing your flight.
L480942 +++$+++ u7388 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Well...
L480941 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
L480873 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ We ought to start camping again, Dad.
L480872 +++$+++ u7388 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
L480871 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Do you like it?
L480870 +++$+++ u7388 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ What about it?
L480869 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ What about camping?
L480868 +++$+++ u7388 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
L480867 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Do you like baseball?
L480860 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Hi.  He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and --
L480859 +++$+++ u7388 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- you must be Jonah.
L480547 +++$+++ u7383 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ LULU +++$+++ Well, here's the number.  If you ever find yourself Sleepless, give us a call.  We also... do babysitting.
L480546 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Thanks, but... we've got plans.
L480545 +++$+++ u7383 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ LULU +++$+++ We live two piers over, don't we? Number 12, right? We're having like a really neat open house today from like four to whenever if you care to stop by.
L480543 +++$+++ u7383 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ LULU +++$+++ You must be Jonah.
L480542 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yes?
L480541 +++$+++ u7383 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ LULU +++$+++ Hi.  Sam?
L480540 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hi.
L481043 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Look, I met somebody.  She's good, and capable and smart. We hit it off.  We can't spend your life chasing after fantasies.
L481042 +++$+++ u7386 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
L481041 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Anyway, Victoria's nice.
L481029 +++$+++ u7386 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ "An Affair To Remember." Did you ever see it? Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.  Before that it was called "Love Affair With Irene Dunne And Charles Boyer."
L481028 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What do you mean?
L481027 +++$+++ u7386 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ It's a little derivative.
L481023 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.
L481022 +++$+++ u7386 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ You're kidding --
L481021 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
L481020 +++$+++ u7386 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ How's Jonah taking it?
L481017 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I tried to talk to her...  It was like I knew her.  Weird.
L481016 +++$+++ u7386 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ You saw her in the airport and then here?
L480986 +++$+++ u7386 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later.  It's so beautiful here.
L480985 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
L480324 +++$+++ u7386 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ I'm sorry --
L480323 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
L480322 +++$+++ u7386 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone.
L480301 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Microwave.  Five minutes.
L480300 +++$+++ u7386 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SUZY +++$+++ Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done.  Ready to eat.  Do you know how to make juice?
L480950 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Sure.  Sure.
L480949 +++$+++ u7388 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
L480948 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ It takes time --
L480947 +++$+++ u7388 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ I read the same article...
L480946 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I read an article about this ...
L480945 +++$+++ u7388 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ He's good at it.
L480944 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ He's ten.
L480896 +++$+++ u7388 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Absolutely.  Right.
L480895 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
L480894 +++$+++ u7388 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Is he there?
L480864 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I've already solved it.  I've hired a hit man.
L480863 +++$+++ u7388 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
L480862 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ We can't finish the job.  She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --
L480839 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
L480838 +++$+++ u7388 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Oh.
L480837 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
L480836 +++$+++ u7388 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
L480835 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You could have called me --
L480834 +++$+++ u7388 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --
L480833 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You did?
L480832 +++$+++ u7388 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ I thought you were never going to call me.
L480831 +++$+++ u7388 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ You look good yourself.
L480830 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You look good.
L480829 +++$+++ u7388 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Hi.
L480828 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hi.
L481462 +++$+++ u7399 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ RAMÓN +++$+++ There's nothing stopping you.
L481461 +++$+++ u7391 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Are you going to let us pass -- or do I have to call the Sheriff?
L481460 +++$+++ u7399 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ RAMÓN +++$+++ No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.
L481459 +++$+++ u7391 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I mean it. I know your work record. You were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that? You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you up. And now they'll sell you down the river. Why don't you wake up, Ray?  That's your name, isn't it, Ray?
L481448 +++$+++ u7391 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ That's none of their affair.
L481447 +++$+++ u7399 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ RAMÓN +++$+++ The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
L481446 +++$+++ u7391 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ No thanks.
L481445 +++$+++ u7399 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ RAMÓN +++$+++ You're welcome to one.
L481444 +++$+++ u7391 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
L481443 +++$+++ u7399 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ RAMÓN +++$+++ Want to go up to your office, Mr. Alexander?
L481362 +++$+++ u7399 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ RAMÓN +++$+++ Your foreman says that's a foreman's job.
L481361 +++$+++ u7391 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Why didn't you give a warning signal?
L481360 +++$+++ u7399 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ RAMÓN +++$+++ I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!
L481871 +++$+++ u7391 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I don't make policy.
L481870 +++$+++ u7403 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Got any more ideas?
L481698 +++$+++ u7391 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ No, just the ring leaders. The fire-eaters. And the ones with big families ...  Barton -- where's that boy?
L481697 +++$+++ u7403 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ You want 'em all arrested?
L481696 +++$+++ u7391 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ You haven't tried locking them up!
L481695 +++$+++ u7403 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
L481694 +++$+++ u7391 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Well?
L481657 +++$+++ u7403 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Now don't get excited, Mr. Alexander. They'll scatter like a covey of quail.
L481656 +++$+++ u7391 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Whose side are you on anyway?
L481655 +++$+++ u7403 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.
L481431 +++$+++ u7403 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Well, those new fellows you hired from out of town -- we brought 'em up here in a truck this morning, but they took one look at that picket line and turned tail.
L481430 +++$+++ u7391 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ How's it going?
L481429 +++$+++ u7403 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Mornin'.
L481749 +++$+++ u7392 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ ANTONIO +++$+++ You know ...  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
L481748 +++$+++ u7399 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ RAMÓN +++$+++ What do you mean -- sex equality?
L481747 +++$+++ u7392 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ ANTONIO +++$+++ He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
L481746 +++$+++ u7399 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ RAMÓN +++$+++ So? What does he want to do about 'em?
L481745 +++$+++ u7392 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ ANTONIO +++$+++ Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
L481744 +++$+++ u7399 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ RAMÓN +++$+++ The woman question?
L481743 +++$+++ u7392 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ ANTONIO +++$+++ It's like Charley Vidal says -- there's two kinds of slavery, wage slavery and domestic slavery. The Woman Question, he calls it.
L481742 +++$+++ u7392 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ ANTONIO +++$+++ Yeah.
L481741 +++$+++ u7399 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ RAMÓN +++$+++ Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
L481740 +++$+++ u7399 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ RAMÓN +++$+++ It never ends.
L481739 +++$+++ u7392 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ ANTONIO +++$+++ How goes it?
L481591 +++$+++ u7399 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ RAMÓN +++$+++ You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.
L481590 +++$+++ u7392 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ ANTONIO +++$+++ Jenkins ain't no boss.  Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?
L481437 +++$+++ u7399 +++$+++ m500 +++$+++ RAMÓN +++$+++ No, no, it's the president of the company himself -- come all the way out here to make Jenkins general manager. So why you acting so mean?
