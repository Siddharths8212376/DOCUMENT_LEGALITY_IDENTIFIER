L482990 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ So they travel around from place to place and preach?
L482989 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.
L482988 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ No kidding.
L482987 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
L482986 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ In West Fork?
L482985 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.
L482981 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ Figured.
L482980 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ As a matter of fact, I am.
L482979 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ You writin' a book or somethin'?
L482978 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ So, where are you from?
L483541 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ I am, but I like imported whiskey. So there I am and I hear the biggest ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a rustlin' right there in front of me. That ole' boy comes right out of the brush, I got a clear shot and he knows he's 'bout to meet his maker. I aim, I got my finger tight on the trigger and then I just smile and say to that ole' coon, go on, now, you get out 'a here.  Then I sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a' that mash whiskey.
L483540 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
L483539 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
L483533 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ What deal?
L483532 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ No kiddin'?
L483527 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ Like hell, you did.
L483526 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
L483471 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ Nope, he ain't Wade.
L483470 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ He ain't Wade.
L483469 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ I guess.
L483468 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ He ain't half-bad, I guess.
L483467 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him?
L483466 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
L483465 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ What do you think?
L483440 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ Hell, no!
L483439 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
L483438 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ Y'all come back.
L483393 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ Of course, sir.
L483392 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L483384 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ Cap'n...?
L483383 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ He's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble.  And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is.
L483360 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
L483359 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ So, that's Ryan.
L483310 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.
L483309 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?
L483262 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ The hell he didn't.
L483261 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
L483260 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
L483259 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ Shut up, will you?
L483258 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch.
L483099 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.
L483098 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ Last I knew.
L483067 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ They got squirrels there, too, right?
L483066 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee.
L483012 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ You know what a B.A.R. weighs? Nineteen and a half pounds, not counting ammo.  And you think these things are comfortable?  They may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each, that's thirty-six pounds, right there.
L483011 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
L483010 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me.
L483005 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ Hell, no.  I think he's the best officer in the whole goddamned army, bar none.
L483004 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
L483003 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a fact.
L482903 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
L482902 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ Jackson?
L483549 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ To each, his own.
L483548 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ It's worth it.
L483547 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
L483546 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.
L483545 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ Say what, Cap'n?
L483544 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ I'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass.
L483356 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Keep trying.
L483355 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ Not yet.
L483308 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Good, now get your goddamned gear.
L483307 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
L483306 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
L483305 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
L483303 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Who's Wade?
L483302 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
L483301 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
L483252 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Gives Wade the second shot.
L483251 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ Watching.
L483191 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ They don't send planes to put out machine guns.  Two flank runners with surpressing fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast.
L483190 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ We left them eighty-eights.
L483185 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ My guess, too.
L483184 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ In the shadow by those two trees.
L483183 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Where?
L483108 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Wade?
L483107 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
L483106 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue.
L483104 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources.  Miller Go on.
L483103 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ I'd love to hear it.
L483102 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.
L483009 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ I most likely would have, sir, had I been given the opportunity.
L483008 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
L483007 +++$+++ u7422 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ JACKSON +++$+++ Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.
L482874 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ No, three brothers of his were killed in action.  Command wants him out of there.
L482873 +++$+++ u7427 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SUPPLY SERGEANT +++$+++ Senator's son?
L482872 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going home, if he's alive.
L482869 +++$+++ u7427 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SUPPLY SERGEANT +++$+++ That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me.
L482868 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ How about that jeep?
L482867 +++$+++ u7427 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SUPPLY SERGEANT +++$+++ Sorry, sir.  Division is using everything on wheels to get up to Caen.  How come you guys aren't going?
L482866 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ A half-track, anything.
L482865 +++$+++ u7427 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SUPPLY SERGEANT +++$+++ No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.
L482864 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ White-walls?
L482863 +++$+++ u7427 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SUPPLY SERGEANT +++$+++ Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
L483529 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ I changed my mind.
L483528 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ Captain, what about our deal?
L483525 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.
L483524 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ What'd you say, Captain?
L483428 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ That's better, but you've still got a long way to go.  Talk to Reiben, he's a natural and works at it, he'll give you some pointers.
L483427 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ Goddamn it, sir...
L483426 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
L483425 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ But, sir...
L483424 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.
L483420 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ The Germans do.
L483419 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Sure, you got one?
L483418 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ Would they notice and eighty-eight?
L483417 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
L483416 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ What about our grenades?
L483408 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Those guns are close.
L483407 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.
L483387 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ You don't count.
L483386 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
L483332 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Same place we are.
L483331 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ I wonder where they're going.
L483213 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Plenty.
L483212 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ That only leaves three.
L483211 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
L483210 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ The men said, nine.
L483209 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
L483208 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ Good luck, Captain.
L483187 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ A machine gun.
L483186 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ What is it?
L483181 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
L483180 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
L483179 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Did he see any sign of them?
L483178 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ Five nights ago, he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg.  The leg got infected. Last night he went to Ville Cholet to get a doctor.  The doctor refused to come and when he got back, this is what he found.  The Krauts must have shown up while he was gone.
L483175 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ I don't expect to live that long.
L483174 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
L483173 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
L483172 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ Over three-hundred.
L483170 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ Where are you from, Captain?
L483169 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Some.
L483168 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ You know classical music?
L483167 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ It seemed appropriate.
L483166 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ I heard.
L483165 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ I've been humming it.
L483164 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
L483163 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ It looks like a Renoir.
L483151 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ You think the rest of us were?
L483150 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ I wasn't made for this.
L483113 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Sarge?
L483112 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ Pass.
L483111 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Upham?
L483079 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
L483078 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ But you could have gotten killed and I...
L483077 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ It was nothing.
L483076 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I...
L483045 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ DASHES across the street.
L483044 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him.
L483043 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Glad of it.
L482968 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ That's not all.  There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell.
L482967 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire?
L482943 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ FORWARD!  FORWARD!  NOW REVERSE!
L482942 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ I know about bracketing.  I read about it.  The next one is going to land right on us.
L483435 +++$+++ u7426 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SARGE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L483434 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Reiben, I don't know what I'd do without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive.
L483423 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Out of the mouth of babes.
L483422 +++$+++ u7426 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SARGE +++$+++ Uh, oh.
L483413 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
L483412 +++$+++ u7426 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SARGE +++$+++ What are we going to do?
L483411 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
L483410 +++$+++ u7426 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SARGE +++$+++ What do you think?
L483405 +++$+++ u7426 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SARGE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L483404 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.
L483296 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ But, that's my personal brand of stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary about it, if you do it again, you're busted.
L483295 +++$+++ u7426 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SARGE +++$+++ You're welcome, John.
L483294 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.
L483292 +++$+++ u7426 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SARGE +++$+++ I'll do my best.
L483291 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
L483290 +++$+++ u7426 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SARGE +++$+++ I know.
L483289 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.
L483288 +++$+++ u7426 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SARGE +++$+++ Just what I want to do.
L483287 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ No, but if I get any worse, you'll have to relieve me.
L483286 +++$+++ u7426 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SARGE +++$+++ You want me to take over?
L483285 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ I think you're right, Keith.
L483284 +++$+++ u7426 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SARGE +++$+++ John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
L483283 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.
L483282 +++$+++ u7426 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SARGE +++$+++ Except this time, the mission IS a man.
L483281 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men.
L483280 +++$+++ u7426 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SARGE +++$+++ And how do you bluff yourself?
L483279 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
L483278 +++$+++ u7426 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SARGE +++$+++ Oh, yeah?
L483277 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
L483276 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
L483275 +++$+++ u7426 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SARGE +++$+++ And what about your own hand?
L483274 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
L483273 +++$+++ u7426 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SARGE +++$+++ Bits and pieces.
L483272 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
L483271 +++$+++ u7426 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SARGE +++$+++ Yeah.
L483270 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
L483269 +++$+++ u7426 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SARGE +++$+++ Vecchio.
L483268 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
L483266 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Let's just find someplace.
L483265 +++$+++ u7426 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SARGE +++$+++ You alright?
L483247 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot.  He's done this before.
L483246 +++$+++ u7426 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SARGE +++$+++ Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
L483245 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
L483244 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
L483238 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.
L483237 +++$+++ u7426 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SARGE +++$+++ Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder.
L483231 +++$+++ u7423 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field.
