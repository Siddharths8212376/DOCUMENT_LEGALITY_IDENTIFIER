L94673 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Yeah?
L94672 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
L94671 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Did you see her undressed?
L94670 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yes.
L94669 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Twice. without her sensing anything?
L94668 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ . Actually. I've been in twice.
L94667 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ You saw a lot in one night.
L94666 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
L94665 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Wow. Should you tell my father?
L94664 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ . OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
L94663 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ You want to tell me about it?
L94662 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ No way. I'm about to blow up.
L94661 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ You want a Dairy Queen?
L94660 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ It's okay. Don't worry about it.
L94659 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I'm sorry, I didn't.
L94658 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ He got a little jealous.
L94657 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ What's with Mike?
L94626 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what I mean?
L94625 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ What did you see?
L94624 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
L94623 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Well, how did it go?. What happened?
L94411 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Okay, okay. Bye.
L94410 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?
L94409 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
L94408 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Okay. thanks.
L94407 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
L94406 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Are you sure?
L94405 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ I'm going to wait here until she comes.
L94404 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yeah.
L94403 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
L94402 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Look. it can wait till Sunday.
L94401 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Okay. yeah, call.
L94400 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Oh, okay. can I call?
L94399 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
L94398 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
L94397 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ . I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
L94396 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Could you wait a little while. this key may not fit.
L94395 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ O.K.
L94394 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
L94393 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Yeah. but.
L94392 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
L94391 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn't have told you.
L94390 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Why not?
L94389 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
L94387 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ I'll drink to that.
L94386 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Here's to. an interesting experience.
L94381 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Two.
L94380 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ That sounds good.
L94379 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.
L94374 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ This is not my usual Friday night!
L94373 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
L94372 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Brilliant.
L94371 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
L94370 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ What's the plan.
L94358 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
L94357 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
L94356 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
L94355 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
L94354 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
L94353 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
L94352 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
L94351 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ You really want to do this, don't you?
L94350 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date. that does that.
L94349 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Yes. I do.
L94348 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?
L94347 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ I owe you. since I goofed up this one.
L94346 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
L94345 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ So. what's next?
L94343 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yeah.
L94342 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Yeah, if it opens the door.
L94341 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
L94340 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
L94339 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
L94338 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
L94337 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened?
L94336 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Are you alright?
L94325 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Alright. Good luck, yourself.
L94324 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner.
L94323 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
L94322 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
L94321 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Let's go.
L94320 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Alright.
L94319 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Now. we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window .alright?
L94318 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ You've got a point there.
L94317 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
L94316 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
L94315 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
L94314 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ What will I say when she comes to the door?
L94313 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
L94312 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Now, how are you going to do that?
L94311 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
L94310 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
L94309 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
L94308 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
L94307 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
L94306 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Alright, now tell me. What is it?
L94305 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
L94304 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
L94303 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ I'm here, aren't I?
L94302 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I don't want to cause any trouble.
L94300 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute.
L94299 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I'd like to talk to you about something.
L94298 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ I don't know.
L94297 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ You hungry or thirsty, or both?
L94293 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yeah. Good bye.
L94292 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
L94290 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
L94289 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ I've gotta go in.
L94288 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I don't know. he moved away.
L94287 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ What happened to him?
L94286 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ It's not bad. but it's bad enough. it's a lot worse for my father.  I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.
L94285 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Still, it must be kinda rough.
L94284 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
L94283 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
L94282 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ You really do hear a lot, don't you?
L94281 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
L94280 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
L94279 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
L94278 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
L94277 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ I don't know. you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.
L94276 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Where are they?
L94275 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long . the police are watching.
L94274 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Not really, why?  You want to see the building?. Come on, I'll show you.
L94273 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I guess you have to get back home soon?
L94272 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
L94271 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
L94270 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Maybe so.
L94269 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ The ear is from a missing person maybe?
L94268 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ No. this has been going on for some time . several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body. only parts.
L94267 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
L94266 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
L94265 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
L94264 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
L94263 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
L94262 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
L94261 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ What do you know about the ear?. anything?
L94260 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ That's too bad.
L94259 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
L94258 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Yeah. What are you doing now?
L94257 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ What else is new?. right?
L94256 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Terrible. boring.
L94255 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ How is Central these days?
L94254 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Yes.
L94253 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
L94252 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Am I bothering you?
L94251 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
L94250 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
L94249 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Oh yeah?
L94248 +++$+++ u4121 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
L94247 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yeah, how did you know?
L95076 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Good deal Dad.
L95075 +++$+++ u4117 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ MR. BEAUMONT +++$+++ Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
L95074 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ How ya doin' Dad?
L94186 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ It's good to see you, Dad.
L94185 +++$+++ u4117 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ MR. BEAUMONT +++$+++ Good to see you, son.
L94184 +++$+++ u4117 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ MR. BEAUMONT +++$+++ uh uh.

L94182 +++$+++ u4117 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ MR. BEAUMONT +++$+++ uh uh.
L94181 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
L94180 +++$+++ u4117 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ MR. BEAUMONT +++$+++ Hey Jeff.
L94179 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Hi Dad.
L94528 +++$+++ u4118 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ MRS. BEAUMONT +++$+++ You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
L94527 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Nothing. I'm fine.
L94526 +++$+++ u4118 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ MRS. BEAUMONT +++$+++ Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
L94525 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ God. you scared me.
L94369 +++$+++ u4118 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ MRS. BEAUMONT +++$+++ Of course, Jeffrey.
L94368 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Can I use the car tonight?
L94209 +++$+++ u4118 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ MRS. BEAUMONT +++$+++ Alright.
L94208 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ No, I'm just gonna walk around.

L94170 +++$+++ u4118 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ MRS. BEAUMONT +++$+++ .Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store. maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.

L94168 +++$+++ u4118 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ MRS. BEAUMONT +++$+++ It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.

L94166 +++$+++ u4118 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ MRS. BEAUMONT +++$+++ He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.

L94139 +++$+++ u4118 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ MRS. BEAUMONT +++$+++ Jeffrey. honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do. it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
L94138 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.

L94604 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
L94603 +++$+++ u4116 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
L94602 +++$+++ u4115 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ No. you're right.
L94601 +++$+++ u4116 +++$+++ m275 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean. no offense.
