L331670 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ We're out of a job.
L331669 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ So what are you thinking?
L331665 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ How did you do it?!  How did you do this?!
L331664 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ We were right!
L331663 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. They do move in herds!
L331659 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Say again?
L331658 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You've got a T-rex!?  He's got a T-rex!  A T-rex!  He said he's- -
L331653 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ They were wrong.  Case closed.  This thing doesn't live in a swamp to support it's body weight for God's sake!
L331652 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Ellie, we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply, they're totally wrong!  This is a warm-blooded creature.  They're totally wrong.

L331650 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ The movement!
L331607 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ What kind of park is it?
L331606 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Why would they care what we think?
L331600 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Small versions of adults, honey.
L331599 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ And what are those?
L331594 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Sattler.
L331593 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
L331592 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Okay, who's the jerk?
L331582 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ It frustrates me so much that I love you, that I need to strangle you right now!
L331581 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
L331580 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Anything else, you old fossil?
L331579 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ The Cretaceous.
L331578 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ The what?
L331577 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
L331576 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
L331575 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
L331574 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
L331573 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ They smell.
L331572 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Cheap, cheap, cheap.
L331571 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
L331570 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
L331569 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
L331568 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.
L331560 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -
L331559 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
L331543 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.
L331542 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -
L331541 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ If they died together, they lived together. Suggests some kind of social order.
L331540 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ The taphonomy sure looks that way.
L331539 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ They died together?
L331538 +++$+++ u6165 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Four complete skeletons. . . . such a small area. . . the same time horizon - -
L332305 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Like hell it is!
L332304 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ It's all right.
L332303 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ Because we're being hunted.  From the bushes straight ahead.
L332302 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Why not?
L332301 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ No. We can't.
L332300 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I can see the shed from here!  We can make it if we run!
L332299 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ C'mon on, this way.
L332298 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ The shutdown must have turned off all the fences. Goddamn it! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.
L332297 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Oh my God.  Aw, God.
L332296 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ Stick to my heels.
L332295 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Okay, I'm on channel two.
L332288 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.
L332287 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ Come on, let's go.
L332280 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Okay.
L332279 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ I'm going with you.
L332277 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
L332276 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.
L332228 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What's that?
L332227 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
L332136 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ They're not here.
L332135 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Alan?!
L332134 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ I don't know.
L332133 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Do you see anything?
L332132 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Alan!
L332131 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ Dr. Grant!
L332130 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ The other car!
L332129 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ Ellie, com one!!
L332128 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ No, no, no!
L332127 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ Dr. Sattler, I've seen a lot of animal attacks.  People just disappear.  No blood, no trace.  	That's the way it happens.
L331758 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ That's right.  But they never attack the same place twice.  They were testing the fences for weaknesses. Systematically.  They remembered.
L331757 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ The fences are electrified, right?
L331756 +++$+++ u6170 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MULDOON +++$+++ They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  That one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
L332248 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Yes.  It's not a criticism, by the way.
L332247 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ - - shut up.
L332246 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Yes?
L332238 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan. 
L332237 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever.
L332148 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Must go faster, go, go.  Open it up, 5th gear, 5th gear! Here it comes!  Stand on it!  Fifth - stand on it, 5th gear, go!
L332147 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
L332146 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
L332145 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Faster, faster!
L332124 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Please - - chance it.
L332123 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Can we chance moving him?
L331909 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L331908 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Dino droppings?
L331874 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Alan?
L331873 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
L331872 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Alan?
L331871 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.
L331870 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Unpredictability....
L331869 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?
L331868 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Oh, imperfections?
L331867 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ - - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
L331866 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Alan, listen to this.
L331865 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
L331864 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Uh - - thumb!  The same way.
L331862 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ It simply deals with unpredictability in complex systems.  It's only principle is the Butterfly Effect. A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine.
L331861 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I'm still not clear on Chaos.
L331860 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ You see?  The tyrannosaur doesn't obey set patterns or park schedules.  It's the essence of Chaos.
L331851 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Dinosaur eats man.  Woman inherits the Earth.
L331850 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ God creates dinosaurs.  God destroys dinosaurs.  God creates man.  Man destroys God.  Man creates dinosaurs.
L331735 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Anti-nature.
L331734 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ It's anti-nature.
L331733 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
L331732 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ And scary.
L331731 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ And scary.
L331730 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I know, it's very exciting.
L331729 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I get ah - -
L331728 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ That's right.  Will break through.
L331639 +++$+++ u6169 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ No?  Non-linear equations?  Strange attractions?  Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction!
L331638 +++$+++ u6163 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ No.
L331536 +++$+++ u6172 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ROSTAGNO +++$+++ Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
L331535 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ Why not?
L331534 +++$+++ u6172 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ROSTAGNO +++$+++ Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
L331533 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.  They want Alan Grant.
L331530 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down.  If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here.
L331529 +++$+++ u6172 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ROSTAGNO +++$+++ Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.
L331528 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ I understand that.  I'm sorry to hear that. We'd be well advised to deal with this situation now.  The insurance company - -
L331527 +++$+++ u6172 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ROSTAGNO +++$+++ He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
L331526 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
L331525 +++$+++ u6172 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ROSTAGNO +++$+++ He sends his apologies.
L331524 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ What's this I hear at the airportä Hammond's not even here?
L331523 +++$+++ u6172 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ ROSTAGNO +++$+++ Hola, bienvenido
L331522 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ Hola, Juanito
L332023 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ Then they're expensive.  Put them back.
L332022 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Yeah.
L332021 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ Are they heavy?
L332020 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ In a box under my seat.
L332019 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ Hey!  Where did you find those things?
L332015 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ People were gettin' bloody noses - - things on your head - - aneurisms - -
L332014 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
L332013 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Up and down, up and down!
L331829 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Dilophosaurus.
L331828 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ What are we looking for?
L331827 +++$+++ u6173 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ I can't see.
L331799 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Brakes?  No.  No brakes.  They're electric cars, guided by this track in the roadway, and totally non-polluting, top of the line!
L331798 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ Hey!  Where are the brakes?
L331797 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Have a heart gentlemen.  Their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion.
L331785 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ Thank you.
L331784 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I don't believe it.  I expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one I've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer!?
L331766 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ I've never been a rich man.  I hear it's nice.  Is it nice?
L331765 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
L331764 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ - - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
L331763 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ Sure, they will, they will.  We'll have a - - coupon day or something.
L331762 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
L331761 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ And we can charge anything we want!  Two thousand a day, ten thousand a day - - people will pay it!  And then there's the merchandising - -
L331701 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.
L331700 +++$+++ u6164 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ GENNARO +++$+++ John, we - - what I'm just saying....
L331689 +++$+++ u6166 +++$+++ m411 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
