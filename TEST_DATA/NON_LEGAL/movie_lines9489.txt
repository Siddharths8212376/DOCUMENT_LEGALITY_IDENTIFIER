L637413 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ What the hell are you doing here?
L637365 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I need a cigarette!  She left my office four years ago, we're looking for a chart...  I need a cigarette...
L637364 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
L637363 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...four years ago...
L637357 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...you need some old forms that she had... somebody's dying...
L637356 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...yeah... good...
L637351 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ The Hospital...?
L637350 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ The broad has disappeared...
L637349 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
L637336 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ How old are you, how many children... when did you last eat...
L637335 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ The 'History'...?
L637334 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
L637333 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What did she do?
L637332 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Uh... the admitting nurse...
L637331 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ What difference can that make...? All right...
L637330 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
L637329 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
L637328 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...one of the other nurses?
L637327 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ 'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
L637326 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Read me what she said.
L637325 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
L637324 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ The Doctors.
L637323 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
L637322 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Yeah. I'm awake.
L637321 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Are you with me... are you awake...?
L637314 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I think we tried that. The case is over.
L637313 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ That's right.
L637312 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You use their witness.
L637311 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness?
L637182 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Yeah.
L637181 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ And all we've got is a witch doctor!
L637180 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm swell.
L637179 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ How are you holding up?
L637099 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
L637098 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
L637097 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ D'you find the obstetric nurse?
L637096 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Yeah? How's our new witness?
L637014 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?
L637013 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I can't talk now.
L637012 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What happened, Joey...?
L636941 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
L636940 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
L636939 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I've got to go see Gruber.  What's the best cigars you have?
L636938 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Today is Tuesday. What?
L636937 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Oh shit, what's today?
L636936 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ John: gimme a cuesta-ray.
L636935 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
L636934 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
L636933 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ They still have to take it to a jury.
L636932 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
L636931 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ So what?
L636930 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Mary Rooney. She won't talk to me. I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this.
L636929 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
L636928 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Been a long time, huh...?
L636864 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm going to get laid.
L636863 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
L636862 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Jimmy? Bushmills.  Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
L636861 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...
L636860 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You got a good memory, Franky.
L636859 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
L636858 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Right.
L636857 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
L636856 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Right.
L636855 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ 'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up.
L636854 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ No.
L636853 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
L636852 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...Gruber's not bad.
L636851 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
L636850 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
L636849 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Admittance form is wrong.
L636848 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
L636847 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
L636846 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Who have we got?
L636836 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I have to try this case. I have to do it, Mick. I've got to stand up for that girl. I need your help.  Mick, will you help me...?  Will you help me...?
L636835 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
L636834 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...I have to stand up for her...
L636833 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
L636832 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...he's a good man...
L636831 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?
L636830 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
L636829 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What?
L636828 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Mick. Mick. Mick...
L636827 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it. We let them buy the case. That's what I took it for. You let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer...
L636826 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ They killed her. And they're trying to buy it...
L636825 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
L636824 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm going to help her.
L636823 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand?  Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
L636822 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...I'm going to need your help...
L636821 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Are you out of your mind...?
L636820 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Don't touch anything.
L636819 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Come on. Let's get a drink.
L636818 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What do you want?
L636817 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I have to talk to you.
L636664 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...I get these people to trust you -- they're coming here tomorrow by the way -- I get this expert doctor to talk to you. I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months. You're 'sposed to be in court. I bet you haven't even seen the file.
L636663 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...hey, I don't need your charity...
L636662 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...
L636661 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
L636660 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
L636659 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...now who is that...?
L636658 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
L636657 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Uh...
L636656 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What the hell do you think you're doing...?  What's going on here...?
L636655 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Hi, Mickey...
L637347 +++$+++ u3418 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ROONEY +++$+++ You saw Kat in New York...  ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
L637346 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ What?
L637345 +++$+++ u3418 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ROONEY +++$+++ In New York?
L637344 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I just saw her.
L637343 +++$+++ u3418 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ROONEY +++$+++ She did?
L637342 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ She told me.
L637341 +++$+++ u3418 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ROONEY +++$+++ I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
L637340 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
L637297 +++$+++ u3420 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ Because she was anemic.  It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...
L637296 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Huh. And why is that?
L637295 +++$+++ u3420 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ Yes.
L637294 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
L637293 +++$+++ u3420 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ Brain damage could have been... it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
L637287 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
L637286 +++$+++ u3420 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
L637285 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ What happened in those three minutes...?
L637284 +++$+++ u3420 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ ...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
L637283 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ What happened in those three...
L637282 +++$+++ u3420 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.  We were trying to restore her...
L637281 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...they start again three minutes earlier...
L637280 +++$+++ u3420 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ As I've said we had some more...
L637279 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.  And they resume seven minutes...
L637278 +++$+++ u3420 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ We, we were rather busy...
L637277 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
L637276 +++$+++ u3420 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ Yes, the roving nurse...
L637275 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...of the procedures...
L637274 +++$+++ u3420 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ Yes.
L637273 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...there are notations every thirty seconds...
L637272 +++$+++ u3420 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ Yes, that's correct.
L637271 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
L637270 +++$+++ u3420 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ Yes.
L637269 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Dr. Towler...
L636989 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Okay. Now, so he's in jail. He, finally, he gets to see the light, he calls up Harrington, he says he thinks he made a mistake. As if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he's released from jail.  P.S. He's fired from the firm, his wife divorces him, he turns to drink and mopes around three and a half years.  You like that story?
L636988 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Me, too.
L636987 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?
L636986 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Huh.
L636985 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
L636984 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ The Big Boy did...?
L636983 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
L636982 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Yes.
L636981 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...?
L636980 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Should I?
L636979 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
L636963 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ So far you're great. You got a cigarette?
L636962 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ How'm I doing so far?
L636961 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
L645695 +++$+++ u3423 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ ALONZO HOGUE +++$+++ Come on out!  We're friends!
L645694 +++$+++ u3438 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ WASH PERRY +++$+++ Hey, there - open up!
L645687 +++$+++ u3423 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ ALONZO HOGUE +++$+++ We could show 'em we're friendly, huh?  Walk out there with a white flag!  Here - I got an old sugar sack in my car!
L645686 +++$+++ u3438 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ WASH PERRY +++$+++ Hey, how about that!
L645685 +++$+++ u3423 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ ALONZO HOGUE +++$+++ We'd be in all the papers!
L645684 +++$+++ u3438 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ WASH PERRY +++$+++ We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
L645673 +++$+++ u3423 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ ALONZO HOGUE +++$+++ Darnedest thing I ever saw - the way that's unscrewing!
L645672 +++$+++ u3438 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ WASH PERRY +++$+++ It's no meteor, that's for sure!
L645671 +++$+++ u3423 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ ALONZO HOGUE +++$+++ Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
L645670 +++$+++ u3438 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ WASH PERRY +++$+++ It's an enemy sneak attack.  Let's get outta here!
L645665 +++$+++ u3438 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ WASH PERRY +++$+++ Let's go.
L645664 +++$+++ u3423 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ ALONZO HOGUE +++$+++ Yeah.  No sense stayin' out here.
L645663 +++$+++ u3438 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ WASH PERRY +++$+++ That won't start no more fires.  We might's well go home.
L645662 +++$+++ u3423 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ ALONZO HOGUE +++$+++ Looks almost cold now, don't it?
L645945 +++$+++ u3435 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ I'll request the scientists from Pacific-Tech to monitor the drop.  We'll clear the area all around.  After that we'll hit them all over the world. I'll have long-range bombers alerted, loaded and standing by.
L645944 +++$+++ u3424 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ CHIEF OF STAFF +++$+++ Then our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.
L645943 +++$+++ u3435 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ There's only one thing that will stop the Martians!  We've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians.  Now there's no choice.  The United Nations has voted authority to the United States.  The White House will confirm an order to use the Atom bomb.
L645942 +++$+++ u3435 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ All right - I've seen enough!
L645941 +++$+++ u3424 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ CHIEF OF STAFF +++$+++ Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...
L645924 +++$+++ u3435 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ The same thing that happened on our Pacific Coast.  Anything from them yet?
L645923 +++$+++ u3424 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ CHIEF OF STAFF +++$+++ Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through.
L645922 +++$+++ u3435 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ That explains why communication is cut the moment their machines begin to move.
L646054 +++$+++ u3425 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ But I think I know where she'll be....
L646053 +++$+++ u3430 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ M.P. DRIVER +++$+++ You look kinda lost yourself.
L646050 +++$+++ u3425 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
L646049 +++$+++ u3430 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ M.P. DRIVER +++$+++ Hurry up!  Jump in!
L646046 +++$+++ u3425 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!
L646045 +++$+++ u3430 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ M.P. DRIVER +++$+++ There's nobody left around here now.
L646044 +++$+++ u3425 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ I'm looking for some Pacific-Tech professors...
L646043 +++$+++ u3430 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ M.P. DRIVER +++$+++ Hey, you!  Better get outa here!
L646023 +++$+++ u3437 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ Don't let's lose each other.
L646022 +++$+++ u3425 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
L646021 +++$+++ u3437 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
L646020 +++$+++ u3437 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ I wonder if they're going through this too...?
L646019 +++$+++ u3425 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ The Rockies...!  You'd rather get back to that big family of yours in Minnesota, wouldn't you?
L645988 +++$+++ u3425 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ That's the kind of a kid brother you'd have!
L645987 +++$+++ u3437 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ How'd you guess?
L645986 +++$+++ u3425 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
L645985 +++$+++ u3437 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ My kid brother has one.  You know why?
L645984 +++$+++ u3425 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
L645983 +++$+++ u3437 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
L645982 +++$+++ u3425 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?
L645981 +++$+++ u3437 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ Is it possible to go in right after the explosion?
L645913 +++$+++ u3425 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!
L645912 +++$+++ u3437 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ They've blocked it!
L645909 +++$+++ u3425 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ Maybe ...  Maybe they want to take us alive.
L645908 +++$+++ u3437 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
L645907 +++$+++ u3425 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ Maybe they aren't too sure we're here.
L645905 +++$+++ u3425 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ We're right in a nest of 'em! ... I've got to get a look at them.
L645904 +++$+++ u3437 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
L645903 +++$+++ u3425 +++$+++ m226 +++$+++ CLAYTON +++$+++ What was it like?
