L336520 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ --Edmonds.  I know.  You lost to Karpov in '82, didn't you?
L336519 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ And this Jeremy--
L336518 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I see you're still having problems with your openings.
L336512 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's important.
L336511 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I'm busy right now.
L336496 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.
L336495 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ What do you think he did?
L336494 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We're not sure.
L336493 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on.  What'd he do?
L336492 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What did Dr. Fulton tell you?
L336491 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
L336490 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
L336489 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
L336488 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Well?
L336869 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Didn't you tell me that Debi Rutlege had just moved into her place also?
L336868 +++$+++ u1704 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ Through a rental agency.
L336867 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Do you know how she found the apartment?
L336866 +++$+++ u1704 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ Ten days ago.
L336865 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in.  How long ago was that?
L336854 +++$+++ u1704 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ You know, I hate to say I told you so, but I warned her.  Coming home at all hours of the night.  A young girl new to the city.  This neighborhood ain't what it used to be.
L336853 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ If you can think of anything else give us a call.
L337210 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's over, Peter.  Let's stop the games.  I'm not sending a car.
L337209 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Did you send the car?
L337206 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I signed the confession.  What about the car?
L337205 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Alright, c'mon Peter.  We're moving you to a cell.
L337202 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Look, I'll do anything you want!  I'll sign anything you want!  Just send a car out to the hotel.
L337201 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I understand that this is just another one of your games.
L337200 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Don't you understand what I'm telling you?  That's why he wants me out of the way.
L337154 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ This is insane!  Can't you see what's going on.  The killer wants me out of the way.  He's setting me up.
L337153 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
L337152 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Jeremy would have never killed himself.
L337046 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I went out.
L337045 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Answer the question.
L337044 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Are we going to go through this again?
L337043 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Where were you last night?
L336990 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ That's got to be it.
L336989 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
L336988 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
L336987 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He uses castles...plural --  then says "can't move me."  Singular.  Not can't move us.
L336986 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.
L336983 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ A building isn't as light as air. What's large, but as light as air and can't be moved?
L336982 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ A building?
L336981 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ As large as castles, you are still light as the air, one hundred men can't move me.  It's posed as a question. What am I?
L336967 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
L336966 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's a commercial area.  No one lives there.
L336950 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ That's all he needs.  He's making the moves.  It's an opening.  I just can't remember the name.  Okay, it's a game.  He's starting it, so he moves first.  He's white.  e2-e4.
L336949 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I still don't see how he could be playing chess against you.  There's only enough grids on the map to be half a board.
L336941 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Maybe I already have.
L336940 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
L336939 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
L336924 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It doesn't make sense.
L336923 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ As large as castles.  You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me.
L336896 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ "Is".  Did you tell him about the institute?
L336895 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Another one?  What word did he leave?
L336611 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Could Emma be the name of the girl he's going to kill?
L336610 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We think he might be making a reference to drugs?  Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.
L336609 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ That's it?
L336607 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- He could be saying the house he's picked is two stories.
L336606 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.
L336605 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ "Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street."  We think he might be making a reference to himself.
L336604 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What have you come up with on the riddle?
L336554 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ That's alright.  We'll take it from here.
L336553 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You want me to go with you?  Maybe I can help.
L336517 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ We've already met.  Haven't we... Doctor.
L336516 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Mister Sanderson, this is Doctor Sheppard.  She's a psychologist helping us out.
L336420 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.
L336419 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
L336377 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I got it from the tournament directory.
L336376 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
L336375 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
L336374 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ This is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room.  Here's one at 9:04 pm.  It says:  From Debi.  Please call me at home.
L336371 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ To my room and then I went for a walk.
L336370 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
L336369 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
L336368 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Could you tell me where you were last night?
L336365 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Only in passing.  To say hello to.
L336364 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I know you're busy so I'll get right to it.  Did you know her?
L337042 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah.  Just let me grab a shower.
L337041 +++$+++ u1705 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Feel like practicing?
L337040 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No.
L337039 +++$+++ u1705 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ She went into town with Mrs. Lutz.  Did they get him?
L336844 +++$+++ u1705 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Exactly... and you did this.
L336843 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Mate in five.
L336842 +++$+++ u1705 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ What do you see here?
L336841 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Who says something's on my mind.
L336840 +++$+++ u1705 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Whatever's on your mind.
L336839 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ About what?
L336838 +++$+++ u1705 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Just thought you might want to talk.
L336837 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You have something you want to say?
L336694 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I want to be the best I can.
L336693 +++$+++ u1705 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ You're always in the middle of a match.
L336692 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I've got be here for the police when they come.  Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now.
L336691 +++$+++ u1705 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Peter...
L336675 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Is it serious?
L336674 +++$+++ u1705 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
L336673 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ We got a problem?
L336312 +++$+++ u1705 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
L336311 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It's a good play, but risky.
L336309 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I suppose you have something in mind?
L336308 +++$+++ u1705 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
L336307 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Then I'll transpose.
L336306 +++$+++ u1705 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ He knows you're aware of that.
L336305 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You opened with the English.  Lutz won't use it.  He opened his first game with it.
L337166 +++$+++ u1710 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ WOMAN'S VOICE +++$+++ "Carefully".  "Carefully". "Carefully".
L337165 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ What are they, please?
L337164 +++$+++ u1710 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ WOMAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
L337163 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
L337162 +++$+++ u1710 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ WOMAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
L337161 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard.  I called you earlier about a book.
L337160 +++$+++ u1710 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ WOMAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Bainbridge Books.
L337118 +++$+++ u1710 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ WOMAN'S VOICE +++$+++ We'll call you back.
L337117 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
L337116 +++$+++ u1710 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ WOMAN'S VOICE +++$+++ I can check and call you back.
L337115 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
L337114 +++$+++ u1710 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ WOMAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Bainbridge Books.
L337265 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Do we have a future?
L337264 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
L337263 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It's over now.
L337261 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ There's a girl in the hospital who is going to live because of you.  You made a difference.
L337260 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I got lucky.
L337259 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ You beat him.
L337113 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Yeah.  I'll be there later.
L337112 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Are you going to come tonight?
L337111 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ You're going to be late for your match.
L337110 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Of course not.
L337109 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it?
L337107 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ He didn't tell you either.
L337106 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You're right.  The killer told me.
L337105 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ No he didn't.
L337104 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Frank told me.
L337103 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ How did you know it was "carefully"?
L337100 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It's got to be grammatically correct.
L337099 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ It could be anything.
L337098 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ If we could just figure out what the next word is going to be.  He said the game's going to end tonight so there's only going to be one more word.
L337031 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
L337030 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Because I know what it says.
L337029 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Why not?
L337028 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ This letter.  I've never opened it.
L337027 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Because she killed herself!!
L337026 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Why?
L337025 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ But I do.
L337024 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
L337023 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It's not that easy.
L337022 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
L337021 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You don't understand.
L337020 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.
L337019 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I can't think any more, unless it's about you.  I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile.  Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard?  Ever since my wife died I've been...  I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them.
L337018 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.
L337017 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
L337016 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Peter...
L337015 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You really haven't seen my best side.
L337014 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
L337013 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
L337012 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
L337011 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ The other night -- I said some things that maybe I shouldn't have.  I mean, you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did.
L337010 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Can I come in?
L337009 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Hi.
L336965 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Right.  Here!  c-4.
L336964 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
L336963 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces.  All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  Why?
L336917 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Where's the note?
L336916 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ What?
L336915 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.
L336914 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ But what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  Violent?
L336913 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Exactly.  It's the key.
L336912 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ For emphasis?
L336911 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?
L336813 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ How could you think that, Kathy?  How could you even consider it?
L336812 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Peter...
L336811 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ --admit what?  That I was right about you in the steam room?  That you're willing to do anything to find out what you want?  Would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room?
L336810 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Peter, you have to admit--
L336806 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Then why are you backing up?
L336805 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Nothing.
L336804 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What's wrong?
L336803 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I tried again and got through.
