L649760 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Guess so.    I keep thinking about the witches - when I was... down there    There was - caring.  They saved me, Ro.  They said 'go back'...  Wel1-  I came back - to you - to love you.  I like seeing it that way, y'know...?
L649759 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ That's GREAT!
L649758 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay.
L649757 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ And I thought I was the mindreader.
L649756 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You're just afraid I'll drop dead before I finish the damn house.

L649732 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You're a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...?
L649729 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Than letts get rnarried, Michael.  I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes.
L649728 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU. 
L649727 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I don't think of us that way - ever.
L649726 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Ro, how long have we known each other.
L649725 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ If we married, we'd shut him out forever.
L649724 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Maybe he's just - waiting...
L649723 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
L649722 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.
L649709 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Michael - this is Beatrice Mayfair. And this is her brother, Giff---
L649708 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Hello..

L649691 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Let's see.
L649690 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.
L649665 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ They need doctors in New Orleans too.   Michael - think what I could do with the money!
L649664 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What about your work back home...?
L649663 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
L649662 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.
L649659 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I've come home, Michae1, for the first time.  I want to stay here - with you.
L649658 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
L649657 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Do you love me, Michael...?
L649656 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I am!   And so are you.  You thought you'd found yourself a nice, sensible doctor. pause)  Michael, if you don't want -
L649655 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
L649654 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here.
L649643 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
L649642 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan!
L649641 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
L649640 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---
L649638 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  God, Michael --- what am I...?
L649637 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
L649636 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
L649635 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It could've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane.  Maybe -
L649633 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ - a witch.
L649632 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ She - she said I - I was a ---
L649631 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I know.  It's not possible --- but I know.
L649630 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You know...?
L649465 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Goodbye, Michael.   I love you.
L649464 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
L649463 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans.  Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me.  I'll call you there.
L649462 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What about you coming down here...?
L649461 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I -
L649460 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What's wrong..?
L649459 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
L649458 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Rowan...?
L649457 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
L649456 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Hello...?
L649419 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Mad. for each other.
L649418 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ We're quite a pair, you and I.
L649417 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You could fly down tomorrow.  I could be there the next day  I think I can last that long without you.
L649416 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ 
L649415 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
L649414 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ God knows, I'm intriguing.
L649413 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned.
L649412 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Michael - this place is increadible.  You - you're brilliant...  The things you created...
L649411 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Seems more like a year than a month.
L649407 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work.
L649406 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Stop it.
L649405 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Let's see...  Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -
L649404 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I'm serious.  You don't -
L649403 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
L649402 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -
L649401 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You don't know what you meant -  because you don't know me.
L649400 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ All I meant was -
L649399 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.
L649397 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Captain's orders.
L649396 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Doctor's orders- - -?
L649395 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
L649394 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Why don't you let at do that...?
L649392 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Okay.     y'all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah.
L649391 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H.  Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence.
L649390 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Ms. yin, and Mr. yang  Aha!
L649389 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You look very deep when you do that.  It's interesting.  We're Complete opposites-  I'd never just sit and wait for insparation.  I'd skip my turn and swap some letters.
L649386 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
L649385 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?
L649384 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ He fools around with his patients too.
L649383 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
L649380 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Mm-hmm.     Scared-  I feel a little like the moth and the flame.
L649379 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Too much... too fast...?
L649378 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Nope-  My father died before I was born. My mother died in childbirth.   El1ie was my only blood relation.  so she brought me here... the day after I was born.
L649377 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Really...?  Your family there...?
L649376 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I was born, in New Orleans, too-
L649374 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You still feel that crazy...?
L649373 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
L649372 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ And whose houses do you design...?
L649371 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
L649367 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself.   Like I'm fading away-
L649366 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ It's unbelievable that you can do that.
L649365 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.   There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you...
L649364 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.
L649363 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What're you - a mindreader...?  Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
L649362 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ What else did you see- Michael...?
L649361 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
L649360 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ you're very --- different.
L649359 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Yessssss...
L649358 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
L649357 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ HARDER!
L649356 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Rowan...
L649355 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Harder...
L649348 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ No. I'm not.  Doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about some things.
L649347 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
L649346 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
L649345 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ The one time I want it to work...
L649344 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Just one.  The bar's closed.
L649343 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
L649342 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ What do you see...?
L649339 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ As far as touching things, yes. But the vision - that keeps pouring into my head-    It won't go away God - if I could just understand it.
L649338 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Do they keep everything 'out' ...?
