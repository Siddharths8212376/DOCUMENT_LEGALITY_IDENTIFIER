L242939 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ My birth sign is Water Bearer, twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus.
L242938 +++$+++ u1156 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COS +++$+++ I am prepared to write anything you tell me.
L242937 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
L242936 +++$+++ u1156 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COS +++$+++ So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...
L242485 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ My only visits to Rome, Senator, have been through books.  But the war's over, time to close the door of war once and for all.
L242484 +++$+++ u1157 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ FALCO +++$+++ But have never been?
L242483 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ I've read of it.
L242482 +++$+++ u1157 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ FALCO +++$+++ You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
L242481 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
L242480 +++$+++ u1157 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ FALCO +++$+++ God of passages and changes?
L242479 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ The battle was won, today, and I prefer to believe it was a gift of Janus, the eldest God of Rome.  God of my ancestors.
L242646 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ I hope you live to see what I believe...
L242645 +++$+++ u1158 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ GAIUS +++$+++ The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
L242644 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ The Senate too?
L242506 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ We all know what right is, Senator.
L242505 +++$+++ u1158 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ GAIUS +++$+++ The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
L242504 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.
L242475 +++$+++ u1158 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ GAIUS +++$+++ Yes!  The days of Imperial Prerogative and disdain for the Senate are over -- thanks to your father!  Now report to the Senate, Master Galen:  what is Marcus' state?
L242474 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ I would venture, with all respect: the Emperor's health is the business of every soul in the empire.
L242865 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ You don't know how wrong you are.
L242864 +++$+++ u1159 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ GRACCHUS +++$+++ You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
L242863 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
L242862 +++$+++ u1159 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ GRACCHUS +++$+++ Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.
L242861 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
L242860 +++$+++ u1159 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ GRACCHUS +++$+++ How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
L242859 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ You're hearing about somebody else.
L242858 +++$+++ u1159 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ GRACCHUS +++$+++ Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.
L242660 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ They can't... if this is Rome...
L242659 +++$+++ u1160 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ JUBA +++$+++ Is this Rome?  Are we just going to be executed?
L242652 +++$+++ u1160 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ JUBA +++$+++ That's what worries me...
L242651 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.
L242650 +++$+++ u1160 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ JUBA +++$+++ My loyalties... were in doubt.
L242649 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Why you?
L242648 +++$+++ u1160 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ JUBA +++$+++ You on your way to trial, too, general?  Or do you think they've already had our trial?
L242919 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.
L242918 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Where are they?
L242917 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive.  All of them.
L242916 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ He killed his father and then my family...
L242915 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
L242914 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Would that Marcus had lived.
L242913 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ You cannot die.
L242908 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ "But what if I wish to be purple?"
L242907 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ "If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic, then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads. But..."
L242906 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?
L242905 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters.
L242902 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ For the sake of the Gods, you're not leading these men?  How like my father you are.  You 'believe'... I guess that's why you're still alive.
L242901 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Twenty years I've led men to die. For me it was the glory of Rome. But that was something.  If it wasn't that, then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore -- but that was something!  These men here are butchered for laughs!  Their lives are like jokes delivered in the back alley theaters where their death is a punch line!
L242899 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ But you do exist.  Narcissus:  hero of the battle of the Danube.
L242898 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
L242897 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ I came here to see that you stay alive.  The people need a living breathing alternative to Commodus, a hero.
L242891 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Yours will do!
L242890 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.
L242555 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ Of course I know -- who do you think is paying for it?  The Emperor himself, didn't you know?  Why do you think Commodus came rushing up to the front?  Burning patriotism? Filial love?  He wants to be sure when he takes over there's enough cash left in the treasury to... play Emperor.  Watch out for him, Narcissus; he's inexperienced, but... be careful.
L242554 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
L242553 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?
L242552 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Why do you play at being drunk?
L242551 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
L242550 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
L242549 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
L242548 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Sneaking around with your brother?
L242547 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
L242459 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Only from a distance.
L242458 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ You know our two most senior Senators:  Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus?
L242455 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ Narcissus!  Terrified?  You?  The only thing he's scared of is me.
L242454 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day.
L242537 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power.
L242536 +++$+++ u1162 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ MARCUS AURELIUS +++$+++ They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
L242535 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ They fear me.
L242534 +++$+++ u1162 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ MARCUS AURELIUS +++$+++ The Senators admire you.
L242533 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.
L242532 +++$+++ u1162 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ MARCUS AURELIUS +++$+++ A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
L242531 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
L242530 +++$+++ u1162 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ MARCUS AURELIUS +++$+++ Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
L242529 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ So I understand.
L242528 +++$+++ u1162 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ MARCUS AURELIUS +++$+++ It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
L242527 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
L242526 +++$+++ u1162 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ MARCUS AURELIUS +++$+++ If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!
L242525 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ He's like you, sir, too tough for the Gods to swallow.
L242524 +++$+++ u1162 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ MARCUS AURELIUS +++$+++ Servis made it through again?
L242523 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ There's no reason to say that. Everyone knows you're going to be well.  I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.
L242522 +++$+++ u1162 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ MARCUS AURELIUS +++$+++ I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
L242521 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
L242520 +++$+++ u1162 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ MARCUS AURELIUS +++$+++ I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
L242517 +++$+++ u1162 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ MARCUS AURELIUS +++$+++ Commodus -- listen to Narcissus, listen to the man who has never lost a battle for Rome!  You're young with years ahead of you before you gain the experience to wear the purple!
L242516 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
L242515 +++$+++ u1162 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ MARCUS AURELIUS +++$+++ Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
L242606 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ On my honor as your daddy...
L242605 +++$+++ u1167 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ THEMIS +++$+++ On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
L242604 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ As soon as I can.
L242603 +++$+++ u1167 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ THEMIS +++$+++ Tomorrow?
L242602 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Don't stop to visit -- take the children straight home and I'll follow as soon as I can.
L242566 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Much more colorful than the ones we wear.  And, of course, less dented.
L242565 +++$+++ u1167 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ THEMIS +++$+++ I made the plume from a quail feather.
L243068 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Can you stop that slaughter?!  Can you free these men?
L243067 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ QUINTUS +++$+++ What are you fighting for in here? The good of Rome?  I can end this madness now!  Take the job for the sake of the Gods, live!
L243055 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ QUINTUS +++$+++ The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!
L243054 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
L243053 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ QUINTUS +++$+++ You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!
L243052 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
L243051 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ QUINTUS +++$+++ It's my job to keep my job.  And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard.  Good ole Tribuus has been retired.
L243050 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons.
L243049 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ QUINTUS +++$+++ I was summoned.
L243048 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ You brought the army into Rome.
L242633 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ QUINTUS +++$+++ I can't let you do that.
L242632 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ On his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here.  The Senate may be vacillating, but I have the army behind me.  I'm taking half a cohort and restocking that fort.
L242629 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Well, they die for it!
L242628 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ QUINTUS +++$+++ My troops don't make policy.
L242627 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Rome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging for mercy? Have you told your troops that?
L242626 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ QUINTUS +++$+++ Rome is going to pay an allotment to the German tribes on an annual basis.
L242625 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ What deal?
L242624 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ QUINTUS +++$+++ Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.
L242616 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive.  They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.
L242615 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ QUINTUS +++$+++ Serious stuff...
L242449 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ QUINTUS +++$+++ Well, we can try...
L242448 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
L242447 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ QUINTUS +++$+++ What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
L242446 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ What the hell was all that about?
L242428 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Let's hope he doesn't start giving orders.
L242427 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ QUINTUS +++$+++ I see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the army.
L243130 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ That's what I'm going to do.  That's what I'm going to do...
L243129 +++$+++ u1166 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ SELENE +++$+++ You teach them!
L243128 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
L243127 +++$+++ u1166 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ SELENE +++$+++ Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
L243126 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ I'll never die.  You tell the girls that.  You honor our ancestors and I'll be there.  Every night.  At the table of life.
L243125 +++$+++ u1166 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ SELENE +++$+++ I don't want you to die!
L243124 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
L243123 +++$+++ u1166 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ SELENE +++$+++ Narcissus!
L243122 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
L243121 +++$+++ u1166 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ SELENE +++$+++ You're not going!  You have to stay with us!
L243120 +++$+++ u1166 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ SELENE +++$+++ No!
L243119 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ When you get to Ostia, use this -- bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family.  You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia.
L242598 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ What you don't want to imagine is the things I've done.
L242597 +++$+++ u1166 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ SELENE +++$+++ I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
L242596 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
L242595 +++$+++ u1166 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ SELENE +++$+++ I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
L242594 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Quintus is overly idealistic.
L242593 +++$+++ u1166 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ SELENE +++$+++ Let him trust Quintus.
L242592 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me.
L242591 +++$+++ u1166 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ SELENE +++$+++ We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
L242590 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
L242589 +++$+++ u1166 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ SELENE +++$+++ Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
L242588 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Very fancy.  Did you design the bottle?
L242586 +++$+++ u1166 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ SELENE +++$+++ I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.
L242585 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ This is our oil from our estates?
L242583 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ If you win, you know, you have to stay.  It's the losers who get to go home.  Besides, I'm not so sure it is over.  Centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines.
L242582 +++$+++ u1166 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ SELENE +++$+++ The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!
L242581 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ I can see that...
L242580 +++$+++ u1166 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ SELENE +++$+++ You need to come home!
L242578 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Of course...
L242577 +++$+++ u1166 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ SELENE +++$+++ They're studying with Cynics.
L242576 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ What about their philosophy lessons?
L242570 +++$+++ u1166 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ SELENE +++$+++ Athenians...
L242569 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Greeks?
L242568 +++$+++ u1166 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ SELENE +++$+++ Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.
L242564 +++$+++ u1166 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ SELENE +++$+++ Isn't the helmet magnificent?
L242563 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ He's very realistic.
L243117 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ Are you mad?  With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night!  Anyway, I'm not political, I'm in the entertainment business.
L243116 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Commodus must hate you.  Free your gladiators and come with us.
L243098 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ Something else, then.  Do the chariot races interest you?
L243097 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ I want nothing to do with the arena.
L243096 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ Let's talk about this later.  Right now we have other things to settle. You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia.  From there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum.  It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on the ocean.  Rich soil.  Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak.
L243043 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ Was I?
L243042 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
L243041 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ So, things change.  The government has moved to the circus.  You're going to fight last.  And Commodus is going to fight first.
L243013 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!
L243012 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
L243011 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ Right, right, what am I thinking of?
L243010 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Before they leave, get gold.
L243009 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
L243008 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Then get a large cash advance.
L243007 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive.
L243006 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome.
L243005 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
L243004 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
L243003 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
L243002 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ How much money is involved?
L242977 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ Oh, shit.  Take your time!  Don't get suckered!  This man is a murderer!  In his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators.  Please, just take the fall!
L242976 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
L242975 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
L242974 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?
L242972 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ It's absolutely not like that!  This is for your own good!  Come on get the rest of your armor on!
L242971 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
L242970 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
L242969 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
L242968 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
L242967 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
L242966 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ You get to come alive again in the country!
L242965 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?
L242964 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ You put this inside your shirt -- when Tiger stabs your stomach -- it's full of pig's blood.  Gushes out everywhere!  It's really impressive.  Fantastic!  Better than the real thing!
L242963 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ What the hell are you talking about, Greek?
L242962 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ Tiger's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer, made us both an offer:  you take a fall.
L242950 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Make us rich, Proximo, make us very rich...
L242949 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ No more bad luck now!  The people are anticipating you!  I have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior -- the true Roman!  The man who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome!
L242935 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Lucky it didn't step on his head.
L242934 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet... It belonged to Cimon of Smyrna... he was crushed by an elephant.
L242895 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ Don't be ridiculous.
L242894 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin.
L242885 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Alive... I'm alive...
L242884 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ General, hang on... drink slowly. You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight.  A fan sent them to you.
L242851 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ Think about it!  Just think about it!
