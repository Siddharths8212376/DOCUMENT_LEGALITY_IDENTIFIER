L120520 +++$+++ u4372 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WARD +++$+++ Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
L120519 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?
L120518 +++$+++ u4372 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WARD +++$+++ Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.
L120517 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
L120516 +++$+++ u4372 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WARD +++$+++ Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
L120515 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do you have any idea what the odds are?
L120309 +++$+++ u4372 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WARD +++$+++ Dang, you are right, Mr Rothstein, I am so sorry.
L120308 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.
L120307 +++$+++ u4372 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WARD +++$+++ I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.
L120306 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
L120305 +++$+++ u4372 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WARD +++$+++ All right, I will, I will.
L120304 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
L120303 +++$+++ u4372 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WARD +++$+++ Yeah, okay.
L120302 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
L120301 +++$+++ u4372 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WARD +++$+++ Well...
L120300 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
L120299 +++$+++ u4372 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WARD +++$+++ Okay, I'll -
L120298 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
L120297 +++$+++ u4372 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WARD +++$+++ Loose machines are right back over there.
L119684 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Mr Rothstein.
L119683 +++$+++ u4372 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WARD +++$+++ It won't happen again, Sam.
L121919 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Green?
L121918 +++$+++ u4334 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps figures.  [Actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] Hey - Hey.
L120940 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Well, that's all I ask, gentlemen, a fair hearing.
L120939 +++$+++ u4334 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission.
L120938 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
L120937 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
L120936 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
L120935 +++$+++ u4334 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ A record of the arrests...
L120934 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ ...worst possible time for me.
L120038 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want?
L120037 +++$+++ u4367 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SIGNALER +++$+++ Look what they did to my hand, man!
L120018 +++$+++ u4367 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SIGNALER +++$+++ God! 
L120017 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
L120016 +++$+++ u4367 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SIGNALER +++$+++ Ye-yeah.
L120015 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ So, you're a righty?
L120014 +++$+++ u4367 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SIGNALER +++$+++ Well, I... I never tried.
L120013 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Can you do it with your left hand?
L120012 +++$+++ u4367 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SIGNALER +++$+++ No, Sir.
L120011 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Can't do it with both hands?
L120010 +++$+++ u4367 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ SIGNALER +++$+++ No.
L120009 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
L120008 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over.
L119669 +++$+++ u4355 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
L119668 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
L119667 +++$+++ u4355 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
L119666 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Is this yours? Your pen?
L119665 +++$+++ u4355 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What?
L119664 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Excuse me.

L120042 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
L120041 +++$+++ u4374 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WINNER +++$+++ I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
L120040 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
L120039 +++$+++ u4374 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ WINNER +++$+++ I just wanna get out of here.
L120454 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah, thanks.

Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?
L120445 +++$+++ u4332 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ Yeah.

L120443 +++$+++ u4332 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.
L120442 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Mm.
L120441 +++$+++ u4332 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ ...I got muscled on the street.

L121290 +++$+++ u4333 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You shut up.
L121289 +++$+++ u4356 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ You know where she gets this from!
L121288 +++$+++ u4356 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Shut your mouth!
L121287 +++$+++ u4333 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I don't want to go to Europe.

L120730 +++$+++ u4361 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO +++$+++ Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
L120729 +++$+++ u4336 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ BORELLI +++$+++ Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
L120728 +++$+++ u4361 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO +++$+++ Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
L120727 +++$+++ u4336 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ BORELLI +++$+++ You gotta go back out there.
L120726 +++$+++ u4361 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO +++$+++ Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
L120725 +++$+++ u4336 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ BORELLI +++$+++ What expenses?
L120724 +++$+++ u4361 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO +++$+++ Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
L120723 +++$+++ u4336 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ BORELLI +++$+++ You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
L120718 +++$+++ u4361 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO +++$+++ What else? I gave her a schaff [Italian-American slang for 'tap'.]
L120717 +++$+++ u4336 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ BORELLI +++$+++ Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
L120716 +++$+++ u4361 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO +++$+++ I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.]
L120825 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Never mind fuckin' Sam. This is personal.  I'll be there in the morning. You can fuckin' try me, fatso.
L120824 +++$+++ u4337 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ CHARLIE CLARK +++$+++ Sam?
L120823 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
L120822 +++$+++ u4337 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ CHARLIE CLARK +++$+++ You can't talk to me like...
L120821 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
L120820 +++$+++ u4337 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ CHARLIE CLARK +++$+++ What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
L120819 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
L120818 +++$+++ u4337 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ CHARLIE CLARK +++$+++ Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
L120817 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
L120816 +++$+++ u4337 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ CHARLIE CLARK +++$+++ Well, I've been busy. 
L120815 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
L120814 +++$+++ u4337 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ CHARLIE CLARK +++$+++ Hi. Good.
L120813 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
L120397 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
L120396 +++$+++ u4337 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ CHARLIE CLARK +++$+++ Yes.
L120395 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
L120394 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
L120393 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
L120392 +++$+++ u4337 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ CHARLIE CLARK +++$+++ You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
L120391 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
L120390 +++$+++ u4337 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ CHARLIE CLARK +++$+++ Yeah, that works out.
