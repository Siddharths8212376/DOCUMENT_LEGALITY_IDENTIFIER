L343703 +++$+++ u1758 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ SERA +++$+++ I sometimes fade out.
L343702 +++$+++ u1755 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You what?
L343701 +++$+++ u1758 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ SERA +++$+++ I guess I do too.
L343700 +++$+++ u1755 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
L343699 +++$+++ u1758 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ SERA +++$+++ Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.
L343697 +++$+++ u1758 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ SERA +++$+++ No, this is fine. I was just wondering.
L343696 +++$+++ u1755 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ We can go to one if you'd prefer.
L343695 +++$+++ u1758 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ SERA +++$+++ I'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that I mind... I mean, I'm OK with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel?
L343693 +++$+++ u1758 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ SERA +++$+++ No -- S.E.R.A.
L343692 +++$+++ u1755 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Sarah -- with an H?
L343686 +++$+++ u1755 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want...
L343685 +++$+++ u1758 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ SERA +++$+++ You're pretty drunk.
L343684 +++$+++ u1758 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ SERA +++$+++ Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that. You're pretty drunk.
L343683 +++$+++ u1755 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ That is, if you'll come to my room for an hour, I will give you five hundred dollars.
L343682 +++$+++ u1755 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ That's funny.  I wonder if you'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me?
L343681 +++$+++ u1758 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ SERA +++$+++ Isn't it illegal to drink and drive?
L343680 +++$+++ u1758 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ SERA +++$+++ Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
L343679 +++$+++ u1755 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Are you working?
L343678 +++$+++ u1758 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ SERA +++$+++ Hello.
L343677 +++$+++ u1755 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Hello!
L343584 +++$+++ u1755 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I don't know. I'll find out though.
L343583 +++$+++ u1756 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ How much, do you think?
L343582 +++$+++ u1755 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
L343581 +++$+++ u1756 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
L343580 +++$+++ u1755 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ How'd this happen?
L343579 +++$+++ u1756 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears?
L343578 +++$+++ u1755 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ What did they look like?
L343577 +++$+++ u1756 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
L343576 +++$+++ u1755 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Hey, Brad... how's it going?
L343754 +++$+++ u1757 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ CONVENTIONEER +++$+++ Sorry. Look... you seem like a nice girl. I'm just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money.
L343753 +++$+++ u1758 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ SERA +++$+++ Please don't raise your voice. I won't bother you about it again.
L343752 +++$+++ u1758 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ SERA +++$+++ I'm sorry, I guess I misunderstood.
L343751 +++$+++ u1757 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ CONVENTIONEER +++$+++ A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
L343750 +++$+++ u1758 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ SERA +++$+++ Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
L343749 +++$+++ u1757 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ CONVENTIONEER +++$+++ Right here at the hotel. Why?
L343748 +++$+++ u1758 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ SERA +++$+++ Where are you staying?
L343747 +++$+++ u1757 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ CONVENTIONEER +++$+++ Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
L343746 +++$+++ u1758 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ SERA +++$+++ So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
L343744 +++$+++ u1757 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ CONVENTIONEER +++$+++ Do I look that obvious? My name's Paul.
L343743 +++$+++ u1758 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ SERA +++$+++ Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
L343742 +++$+++ u1757 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ CONVENTIONEER +++$+++ About ready for another drink?
L343781 +++$+++ u1760 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ Sera... please go.
L343780 +++$+++ u1758 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ SERA +++$+++ Yuri... are you...
L343779 +++$+++ u1760 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.
L343776 +++$+++ u1758 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ SERA +++$+++ No.
L343775 +++$+++ u1760 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ Have you told anyone that I'm here?
L343771 +++$+++ u1758 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ SERA +++$+++ It's me, Yuri.
L343770 +++$+++ u1760 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ Yes? What?
L343736 +++$+++ u1760 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard?
L343735 +++$+++ u1758 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ SERA +++$+++ Don't hit me.
L343734 +++$+++ u1758 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ SERA +++$+++ Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
L343733 +++$+++ u1760 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ A full night on the street and this is all?
L343732 +++$+++ u1758 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ SERA +++$+++ It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
L343731 +++$+++ u1760 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ Where have you been?
L343607 +++$+++ u1760 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ All of it. I need to buy many things... all of it!
L343606 +++$+++ u1758 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ SERA +++$+++ Yes, of course. How much do you need?
L343605 +++$+++ u1760 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ It is, after all, Sera, my money.
L343602 +++$+++ u1760 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ With an old friend.
L343601 +++$+++ u1758 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ SERA +++$+++ Where have you been staying?
L343600 +++$+++ u1760 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ I'm pleased with you, Sera... how you have moved up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the streets...  and how you repay me.
L343591 +++$+++ u1758 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ SERA +++$+++ I am lonely, Yuri.
L343590 +++$+++ u1760 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ You have been lonely?
L343589 +++$+++ u1760 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ I will keep you safe. We are both older.
L343588 +++$+++ u1758 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ SERA +++$+++ I've been all right.
L343587 +++$+++ u1760 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ You have been lonely?
L343546 +++$+++ u1758 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ SERA +++$+++ Please, Yuri.
L343545 +++$+++ u1760 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ I want this, Sera. I need this!
L343544 +++$+++ u1758 +++$+++ m116 +++$+++ SERA +++$+++ I don't want this. Yuri, please. I really don't want this. You know I don't like to do groups.
L344772 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything.
L344771 +++$+++ u1761 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ADVISOR +++$+++ Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one-seventy-five on your LSATs.
L344770 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ I don't need backups. Harvard is the school I'm going to.
L344769 +++$+++ u1761 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ADVISOR +++$+++ Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced "History of Lycra". What are your backups?
L344768 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ I have a 4.0.
L344767 +++$+++ u1761 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ADVISOR +++$+++ But it's a top three school --
L344766 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ That's right.
L344765 +++$+++ u1761 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ADVISOR +++$+++ Harvard Law School?
L345519 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ Who?
L345518 +++$+++ u1762 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ BROOKE +++$+++ You're fired. I have new representation.
L345517 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ What?
L345516 +++$+++ u1762 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ BROOKE +++$+++ Get up.
L345515 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.
L345158 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ I believe we are.
L345157 +++$+++ u1762 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ BROOKE +++$+++ Are we done for today?
L345156 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ I'll take that as a no.
L345155 +++$+++ u1762 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ BROOKE +++$+++ Go to hell.
L345154 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ Were you with another man?
L345153 +++$+++ u1762 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ BROOKE +++$+++ I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.
L345152 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ Brooke, I believe you. But a jury is gonna want an alibi.
L345150 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
L345149 +++$+++ u1762 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ BROOKE +++$+++ I loved him!
L345148 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
L345147 +++$+++ u1762 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ BROOKE +++$+++ Why would I kill my husband?
L345146 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ Where they saw you standing over the body covered in his blood.
L345145 +++$+++ u1762 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ BROOKE +++$+++ I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
L345144 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ You understand you're on trial for murder?
L345143 +++$+++ u1762 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ BROOKE +++$+++ I can't tell you.
L345142 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ What alibi?
L345509 +++$+++ u1762 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ BROOKE +++$+++ To me it is. He doesn't trust me. Why should I trust him?
L345508 +++$+++ u1768 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ EMMETT +++$+++ That's not what's important.
L345507 +++$+++ u1762 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ BROOKE +++$+++ He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
L345506 +++$+++ u1768 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ EMMETT +++$+++ He's an ass that's gonna try.
L345505 +++$+++ u1762 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ BROOKE +++$+++ But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
L345504 +++$+++ u1768 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ EMMETT +++$+++ He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
L345503 +++$+++ u1762 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ BROOKE +++$+++ Is he always such an ass?
L345434 +++$+++ u1762 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ BROOKE +++$+++ He did leave a Cher tape in the pool house once --
L345433 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
L345432 +++$+++ u1762 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ BROOKE +++$+++ What's going on?
L345376 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ I believe you! Don't worry.
L345375 +++$+++ u1762 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ BROOKE +++$+++ I'm not having an affair with Enrique -- you know a Delta Gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong! I just liked watching him bend over to clean the filter --
L345247 +++$+++ u1762 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ BROOKE +++$+++ I'm a fraud! But it's not like normal people can have this ass! If my fans knew, I'd lose everything. I've already lost my husband. I rather be in jail then lose my reputation!
L345246 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ No!
L345243 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ I know! You helped me go from a six to a four!
L345242 +++$+++ u1762 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ BROOKE +++$+++ I have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brooke's Butt Buster workout.
L345241 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ How?
L345240 +++$+++ u1762 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ BROOKE +++$+++ That's just it -- it would ruin me!
L345239 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ Whatever it is -- it could save you.
L345238 +++$+++ u1762 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ BROOKE +++$+++ It's so shameful...
L345237 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ Who could better understand than me?
L345236 +++$+++ u1762 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ BROOKE +++$+++ Elle, I can't. You don't understand.
L345231 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ He means well. He's really brilliant and all.
L345230 +++$+++ u1762 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ BROOKE +++$+++ I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
L345229 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange.
L345162 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ Sort of.
L345161 +++$+++ u1762 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ BROOKE +++$+++ You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
L345160 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan of yours!
L345203 +++$+++ u1763 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ CHUTNEY +++$+++ His dead body with a bullet in it.
L345202 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
L345201 +++$+++ u1763 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ CHUTNEY +++$+++ Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
L345200 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
L345199 +++$+++ u1763 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ CHUTNEY +++$+++ No.
L345198 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ Did she have a weapon in her hand?
L345197 +++$+++ u1763 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ CHUTNEY +++$+++ I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
L345587 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ You, however, had time to hide the gun, didn't you, Chutney? After you shot your father?
L345586 +++$+++ u1763 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ CHUTNEY +++$+++ She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
L345585 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right?
L345581 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ That's right. Because isn't the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at least twenty-four hours after getting a perm at the risk of de-activating the ammonium thiglycolate?
L345580 +++$+++ u1763 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ CHUTNEY +++$+++ Because they got wet.
L345579 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?
L345574 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ You know, a girl in my sorority, Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once. Even though we all told her not to. Curls really weren't the right look for her --  She didn't have your bone structure.
L345573 +++$+++ u1763 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ CHUTNEY +++$+++ Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.
L345572 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ How many, would you say?
L345571 +++$+++ u1763 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ CHUTNEY +++$+++ Yes.
L345570 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
L345568 +++$+++ u1763 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ CHUTNEY +++$+++ Yes.
L345567 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ Where you got in the shower.
L345566 +++$+++ u1763 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ CHUTNEY +++$+++ I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
L345565 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
L345564 +++$+++ u1763 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ CHUTNEY +++$+++ Yes. I was washing my hair.
L345563 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ But you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower.
L345559 +++$+++ u1763 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ CHUTNEY +++$+++ I guess.
L345558 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
L345557 +++$+++ u1763 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ CHUTNEY +++$+++ No. I was in the shower.
L345556 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ Did you hear a shot fired?
L345553 +++$+++ u1763 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ CHUTNEY +++$+++ No, she'd stashed it by then.
L345552 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
L345551 +++$+++ u1763 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ CHUTNEY +++$+++ I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
L345550 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ And when you came downstairs, what happened?
L345549 +++$+++ u1763 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ CHUTNEY +++$+++ Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
L345548 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?
L345090 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ Tell him, Paulette.
L345089 +++$+++ u1764 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Huh?
L345088 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
L345087 +++$+++ u1764 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Come again?
L345085 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ I'm Elle Woods. Ms. Bonafante's attorney.
L345084 +++$+++ u1764 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Who's askin'?
L345083 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ Dewey Newcomb?
L345532 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my "career"?
L345531 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ I do. I'm not allowing it.
L345526 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ Yes, I am.
L345525 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ You're not going up there.
L345480 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ I'm a man who knows what I want.
L345479 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ So everything you just said --
L345478 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
L345477 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ You're hitting on me?
L345474 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ Not really. I know how competitive it all is --
L345473 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
L345471 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ I'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys I have on my payroll.

L345469 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ About the alibi --
L345468 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ Thank you.
L345467 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
L345466 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ Is everything okay?
L345465 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ Sit down.
L345454 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ Thank you!
L345453 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ Good work today, Ms. Woods.
L345429 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off.
L345428 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L345257 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ I promised her I'd keep it secret. I can't break the bonds of sisterhood!
L345256 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ Why the hell not?
L345255 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.
L345254 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ Did you get it?
L345221 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
L345220 +++$+++ u1767 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ELLE +++$+++ All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
L345439 +++$+++ u1769 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ENRIQUE +++$+++ Just the love in my heart.
L345438 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?
L345209 +++$+++ u1769 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ENRIQUE +++$+++ Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
L345208 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
L345207 +++$+++ u1769 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ENRIQUE +++$+++ No, she was crying her eyes out.
L345206 +++$+++ u1765 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ DONOVAN +++$+++ Was she carrying a weapon?
L345205 +++$+++ u1769 +++$+++ m117 +++$+++ ENRIQUE +++$+++ I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
