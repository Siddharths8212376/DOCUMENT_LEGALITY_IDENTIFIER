L420819 +++$+++ u2349 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ ZIEGLER +++$+++ But what am I telling the press about Kent State?
L420813 +++$+++ u2349 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ ZIEGLER +++$+++ What?  Win Vietnam, sir?
L420812 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything!  I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset.  That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing.  I've got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads, we can win this thing.
L420618 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ And we got the "big mo"!  We're back!
L420617 +++$+++ u2349 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ ZIEGLER +++$+++ We got the press this time!
L421538 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ There'll be time for that.
L421537 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
L421536 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ It'll be over soon.
L421446 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ No.  They're not yours.  They are you. You should burn them.
L421445 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ They were for me.  They're mine.
L421444 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ And what would I find out that I haven't known for years.  What makes it so damn sad is that you couldn't confide in any of us. You had to make a record ... for the whole world.
L421442 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ You're drunk!
L421441 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything.  But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ...
L421440 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Don't be ridiculous!
L421439 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ You don't expect me to believe that for one minute, do you?  Does it matter what's on them? Really? ... Murder, Dick?  Sex?  Your secrets, your fantasies?  Or just me and you and ...
L421437 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ What matters to me is whether you understand it.
L421436 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ You can't expect me to explain that to you.
L421435 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ Why didn't you?
L421350 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ Thank you?  Dick, sometimes I understand why they hate you.
L421349 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Thank you.
L421348 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ No, it isn't.  I won't interfere with you anymore.  I'm finished trying.
L421345 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Brezhnev's coming in three days.  I don't want to deal with them.  And him.  And you.
L421344 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ I'm the only left, Dick.  If you don't talk to me, you ...
L421342 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ Whatever it is you've always been hiding.  You're letting it destroy you, Dick.  You won't even ask for help.  You're destroying yourself, Dick.
L421341 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Hiding what?
L421340 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
L421339 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ And what am I doing?
L421338 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ You.  What' you're doing --
L421337 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat?
L421335 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ No.
L421334 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
L421333 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Tomorrow.
L421332 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ When?
L421331 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Yes.
L421110 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ It's not the press that matters. Nixon's wife is proud of him.
L421109 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Not for the Pentagon it isn't.  I'm kissing Mao's ass.  And the press is gonna find some way to shaft Nixon on this one.
L421104 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ How am I going to break this to Bob Hope?
L421103 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ Congratulations, Dick.
L421101 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ You're a long way from Whittier.
L421100 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Is that adjusted for inflation?  Think of the life Mao's led.  In '52 I called him a monster.  Now he could be our most important ally.  Only Nixon could've done that.
L421099 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ Penny for your thoughts.
L420978 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ But they never will, Dick.  No matter how many elections you win, they never will.
L420977 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ No, I don't.  I'm not Jack ...
L420975 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ You've been drinking.  What the hell are you saying?  Jesus, you sound like them now! ...  I've gotta keep fighting, Buddy, for the country.  These people running things, the elite ... they're soft, chickenshit faggots!  They don't have the long-term vision anymore.  They just want to cover their asses or meet girls or tear each other down.  Oh, God, this country's in deep trouble, Buddy ... and I have to see this through.  Mother would've wanted no less of me ... I'm sorry, Buddy.
L420974 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ Sometimes I think that's what you want.
L420973 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon!  They want to destroy Nixon!  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that, Buddy?  It's not pretty.
L420972 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ You personally?
L420971 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Yes!
L420970 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ They're all your enemies?
L420969 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
L420968 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ Then what are you scared of, honey?
L420967 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ I do.  I do.  In my own way.
L420966 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ No, you're not.  So stop comparing yourself to him.  You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it.  Why can't you just enjoy it?
L420965 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ I don't need that, Buddy.  I'm not Jack Kennedy.
L420964 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ Yes, it's been a long time ...
L420963 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
L420962 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
L420961 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Because ... I have to relax.
L420960 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
L420959 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Are you okay?
L420958 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ I've missed you.
L420957 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?
L420952 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ I asked him, "Lyndon, what would you do, on a scale of one to ten?"  And he said, "Bomb the shit out of Hanoi, boy!  Bomb them where they live." ... John, do you think I was too soft on TV?
L420951 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ He looked old, didn't he?
L420641 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ Will you ... would you kiss me?
L420640 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Anything.
L420639 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ Can I just ask for one thing?
L420638 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
L420637 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ Then I'll be there for you.
L420636 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Yes ... you know it!  Yes ... I will. Yeah!
L420635 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ And then you'll be happy?
L420634 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ This.  Above all.
L420633 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ Do you really want this, Dick?
L420632 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.
L420630 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ I need you out there.  It won't be like last time.  The war's crippled the Democrats.  I can win ... We deserve it.  Yeah, it's ours, Buddy -- at last.  Nobody knows better than you.  Frank Nixon's boy.
L420629 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ I don't want them to love me.
L420628 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.
L420627 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...
L420626 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Buddy? ...
L420621 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...
L420620 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ Were you planning to tell me?
L420596 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ They've lost a brother.  You know what that means, Dick.
L420595 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
L420594 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
L420593 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
L420592 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ You don't have to go.
L420591 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ He doesn't want me at the funeral.
L420590 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ Dick, you should call Bobby.
L420437 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ I'll never run again.  I promise.
L420436 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ Is that the truth?
L420435 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Yeah ... I'm out.
L420434 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ Are you serious?
L420433 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ I'll do it.  No more.
L420432 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ If I stop ... there'll be no more talk of divorce?
L420431 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ We can be happy.  We really can.  We love you, Dick.  The girls and I...
L420430 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Buddy, look at me ... just look at me. Do you really want me to quit?
L420429 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ Dick, don't...
L420427 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me.
L420426 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it?  They want to drive us apart.  To beat us.  We can't let them do it.  We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together.
L420425 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ No, I'm not!  I'm finished.
L420424 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Everything's political, for Christ's sake!  I'm political.  And you're political, too!
L420423 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
L420422 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
L420421 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.
L420420 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
L420419 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ I want a divorce.
L420418 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ What are you saying?  What are you talking about?
L420416 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ Not that.  Us.
L420415 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ I'll concede in the morning.
L420414 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ It's over, Dick.
L420413 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Amen to that.
L420412 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ No.  I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
L420411 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Don't you want to listen to Brown's victory speech?
L420407 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Buddy, before you join the jubilation at my being beaten again, you should remember: People vote not out of love, but fear.  They don't teach that at Sunday School or at the Whittier Community Playhouse!
L420406 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
L420405 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.
L420404 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
L420403 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Thank you, Fidel Castro.
L420363 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ You know how much money he had in the bank when he died?  Nothing.  He was so damned honest ...  But I miss him.  I miss him a hell of a lot.
L420362 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ You're not a failure, Dick.
L420361 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
L420360 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
L420359 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
L420358 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
L420357 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
L420356 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ It makes us human ...
L420355 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ It's hard to lose ...
L420354 +++$+++ u2341 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ PAT +++$+++ I know ...
L420353 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ We lost ...
L420517 +++$+++ u2343 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ ROCKEFELLER +++$+++ Well, that's wonderful.  So get me this "crisis" thing, Dick; I'll be glad to take a look at it.
L420516 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
L420515 +++$+++ u2343 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ ROCKEFELLER +++$+++ Hey, you know Henry Kissinger -- he's down from Harvard.  On my staff, foreign policy whiz ...
L420514 +++$+++ u2343 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ ROCKEFELLER +++$+++ The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
L420513 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Some say you are, Rocky.
L420512 +++$+++ u2343 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ ROCKEFELLER +++$+++ Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
L420511 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book.  "Six Crises."
L420509 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ You know: how the voters are gonna play your divorce.
L420508 +++$+++ u2343 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ ROCKEFELLER +++$+++ Whatcha mean by that?
L420507 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Let's wait and see how you survive your first crisis, Rocky ...
L420506 +++$+++ u2343 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ ROCKEFELLER +++$+++ Sounds like you got a crisis syndrome. Aren't you exaggerating a bit, Dick? Call it three-and-a-half, maybe four ...
L420505 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ "Checkers" of course, Hiss, Ike's heart attack, Venezuela, the Kitchen Debate, and Kennedy.
L420504 +++$+++ u2343 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ ROCKEFELLER +++$+++ The "crises"?
L420503 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ What?
L420502 +++$+++ u2343 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ ROCKEFELLER +++$+++ Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
L420501 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Write.  You know, a book.  I'm calling it "Six Crises."  It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write.
L420500 +++$+++ u2343 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ ROCKEFELLER +++$+++ To what?
L420499 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ But being out of the game gives me time to write.
L420498 +++$+++ u2343 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ ROCKEFELLER +++$+++ Someday, Dick.
L420497 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Lost.
L420496 +++$+++ u2343 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ ROCKEFELLER +++$+++ Won or lost?
L420495 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
L420494 +++$+++ u2343 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ ROCKEFELLER +++$+++ Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
L420493 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Hi, Happy.  Well, you're obviously making him happy.
L420492 +++$+++ u2343 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ ROCKEFELLER +++$+++ Oh, Happy!  Dick Nixon ... You remember him.
L420491 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Well enough.  You're looking "happy," Nelson.
L420490 +++$+++ u2343 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ ROCKEFELLER +++$+++ Howya doin'!  New York treating you okay?  I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you at all--
L422325 +++$+++ u2355 +++$+++ m151 +++$+++ ELLIS +++$+++ You can't stop what's comin. Ain't all waitin' on you.
L422324 +++$+++ u2350 +++$+++ m151 +++$+++ BELL +++$+++ I'm... discouraged.
L422323 +++$+++ u2355 +++$+++ m151 +++$+++ ELLIS +++$+++ You're discouraged.

L422316 +++$+++ u2355 +++$+++ m151 +++$+++ ELLIS +++$+++ ...Shot down on his own porch there in Hudspeth County. There was seven or eight of 'em come to the house. Wantin' this and wantin' that. Mac went back in and got his shotgun but they was way ahead of him. Shot him down in his own doorway.  Aunt Ella run out and tried to stop the bleedin'. Him tryin to get hold of the shotgun again. They just set there on their horses watchin' him die. Finally one of 'em says somethin' in Injun and they all turned and left out. Well Mac knew the score even if Aunt Ella didn't. Shot through the left lung and that was that. As they say.
