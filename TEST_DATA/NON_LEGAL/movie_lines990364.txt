L556374 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ You bet your ass.
L556373 +++$+++ u7972 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
L556372 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
L556371 +++$+++ u7972 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.
L556314 +++$+++ u7972 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I heard stories.  I don't think you wanna know.
L556313 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
L556312 +++$+++ u7972 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.
L556310 +++$+++ u7972 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!
L556309 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ I can't help it if men notice me.
L556308 +++$+++ u7972 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Did anybody notice you?
L556307 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
L556306 +++$+++ u7972 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ How do you know?
L556305 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
L556001 +++$+++ u7972 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Oh, sure.
L556000 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
L555997 +++$+++ u7972 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ -- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
L555996 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?
L555745 +++$+++ u7973 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ As brave as my father. As wise.
L555744 +++$+++ u7981 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZOR-EL +++$+++ Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
L555735 +++$+++ u7973 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-
L555734 +++$+++ u7981 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZOR-EL +++$+++ Superman will return it.
L555731 +++$+++ u7973 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ I allowed it to escape the City.
L555730 +++$+++ u7981 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZOR-EL +++$+++ Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
L555729 +++$+++ u7973 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
L555728 +++$+++ u7981 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZOR-EL +++$+++ But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
L555727 +++$+++ u7973 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ I am almost an adult. This is what I want.
L555705 +++$+++ u7980 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZALTAR +++$+++ It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.
L555704 +++$+++ u7973 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ I'm sorry... I didn't know.
L555685 +++$+++ u7973 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ Can you create life?
L555684 +++$+++ u7980 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZALTAR +++$+++ You see, a tree is a living thing.
L555682 +++$+++ u7980 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZALTAR +++$+++ Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this.
L555681 +++$+++ u7973 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ I don't understand.
L555680 +++$+++ u7980 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZALTAR +++$+++ Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in outer space. And we're in inner space.
L555679 +++$+++ u7973 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ Yes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in my head.
L555678 +++$+++ u7980 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZALTAR +++$+++ Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
L555677 +++$+++ u7973 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ Where is Earth?
L555676 +++$+++ u7980 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZALTAR +++$+++ It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
L555675 +++$+++ u7973 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ What's a tree?
L555674 +++$+++ u7980 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZALTAR +++$+++ It's going to be a tree, I think.
L555673 +++$+++ u7973 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ What are you making:
L556049 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Again? You're getting real tight with them. You're gonna be a straight-A student---just kidding, thanks for coming.
L556048 +++$+++ u7974 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
L556047 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
L556004 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Nice? He's cute enough to melt lead!
L556003 +++$+++ u7974 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ He's nice.
L556002 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.
L555992 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
L555991 +++$+++ u7974 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
L555921 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Somebody's gotta do something!!
L555920 +++$+++ u7974 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Lucy; come back!
L555917 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
L555916 +++$+++ u7974 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Why is he acting so strangely?
L555913 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Please, as a favour to me? So I won't  be the only girl?
L555912 +++$+++ u7974 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ It doesn't seem right.
L555911 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
L555910 +++$+++ u7974 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
L555909 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
L555852 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ You sure?
L555851 +++$+++ u7974 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ No thanks. You go on.
L555846 +++$+++ u7974 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ It was just a trim.
L555845 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Your hair looks the same.
L555815 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.
L555814 +++$+++ u7974 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ But what for?
L555813 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
L555812 +++$+++ u7974 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Must've been a defective puck.
L555811 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ How'd you do that?
L555810 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ She's a beast.
L555809 +++$+++ u7974 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ She did that deliberately.
L555807 +++$+++ u7974 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Thank you. You're very kind.
L555806 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
L555805 +++$+++ u7974 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
L555804 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ You're not...an orphan are you?
L555803 +++$+++ u7974 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I'd rather not talk about it.
L555802 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
L555801 +++$+++ u7974 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...
L555800 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ This is all your clothes?
L555799 +++$+++ u7974 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ There isn't any.
L555798 +++$+++ u7975 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
L555797 +++$+++ u7974 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I can do that.
L555903 +++$+++ u7974 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Sure. Mate in five moves.
L555902 +++$+++ u7976 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ MR. DANVERS +++$+++ What? Me?
L555901 +++$+++ u7974 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.
L555860 +++$+++ u7974 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I'd love to.
L555859 +++$+++ u7976 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ MR. DANVERS +++$+++ Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
L555858 +++$+++ u7974 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ No, MR. Danvers.
L555857 +++$+++ u7976 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ MR. DANVERS +++$+++ No plans for the weekend, Linda?
L555789 +++$+++ u7976 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ MR. DANVERS +++$+++ Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here.
L555788 +++$+++ u7974 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.
L555785 +++$+++ u7974 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I'm Linda Lee.
L555784 +++$+++ u7976 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ MR. DANVERS +++$+++ What can I do for you?
L555783 +++$+++ u7974 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.
L555782 +++$+++ u7976 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ MR. DANVERS +++$+++ Don't you believe in knocking?
L556176 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Nonsense.
L556175 +++$+++ u7977 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ NIGEL +++$+++ Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
L556174 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
L556173 +++$+++ u7977 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ NIGEL +++$+++ You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
L556172 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
L556161 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
L556160 +++$+++ u7977 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ NIGEL +++$+++ You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.
L555896 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself.
L555895 +++$+++ u7977 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ NIGEL +++$+++ Nothing's wrong with my skin.
L555894 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.
L555893 +++$+++ u7977 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ NIGEL +++$+++ ...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?
L555892 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ I could teach you a thing or two now.
L555891 +++$+++ u7977 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ NIGEL +++$+++ You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
L555890 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ You're wasting your breath.
L555889 +++$+++ u7977 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ NIGEL +++$+++ I have to talk to you.
L555888 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Nigel, get lost.
L555770 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Throw him out.
L555769 +++$+++ u7977 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ NIGEL +++$+++ You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.
L555768 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ You Scorpios can never take a joke.
L555767 +++$+++ u7977 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ NIGEL +++$+++ Balefire on you, Selena!
L555765 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now burn rubber.
L555764 +++$+++ u7977 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ NIGEL +++$+++ You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
L555763 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.
L555761 +++$+++ u7977 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ NIGEL +++$+++ Cigarette?
L555760 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far.
L555759 +++$+++ u7977 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ NIGEL +++$+++ You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
L555758 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ I just did. Because I have the Power.
L555757 +++$+++ u7977 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ NIGEL +++$+++ You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
L555756 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
L555755 +++$+++ u7977 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ NIGEL +++$+++ It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
L555754 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.
L556439 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ That's home.
L556438 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
L556437 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.
L556435 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
L556434 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Where is inner space?
L556432 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go.
L556431 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
L556430 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ What's it like?
L556424 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.
L556423 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
L556422 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ For what?
L556421 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
L556403 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Not yet.
L556402 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
L556399 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
L556398 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ The Danvers. And two of your little friends.
L556132 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Cheap but effective.
L556131 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ A cheap trick.
L556130 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
L556127 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ I don't scare that easily.
L556126 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
L556125 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Who are you ?
L555927 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
L555926 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ That was meant for me!
L556392 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Zaltar!
L556391 +++$+++ u7980 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZALTAR +++$+++ Goodbye...
L556390 +++$+++ u7980 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZALTAR +++$+++ Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
L556389 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Zaltar. Use the wand!
L556388 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.
L556387 +++$+++ u7980 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZALTAR +++$+++ Yes, mustn't stop.
L556386 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Don't stop. Keep moving.
L556385 +++$+++ u7980 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZALTAR +++$+++ What's that? Never saw anything like that.
L556383 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Better than when I was a child.
L556382 +++$+++ u7980 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZALTAR +++$+++ You can use the wand.
L556350 +++$+++ u7980 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZALTAR +++$+++ Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring!
L556349 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ I heard my mother ask you once "how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?" She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart.
L556348 +++$+++ u7980 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZALTAR +++$+++ Going to try. Didn't say I could.
L556347 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ You're going to take me back?
L556345 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.
L556344 +++$+++ u7980 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZALTAR +++$+++ Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
L556343 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
L556342 +++$+++ u7980 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZALTAR +++$+++ Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
L556341 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Then come with me.
L556340 +++$+++ u7980 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZALTAR +++$+++ Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.
L556338 +++$+++ u7980 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZALTAR +++$+++ No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think.
L556337 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Then teach me how.
L556335 +++$+++ u7980 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZALTAR +++$+++ No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.
L556334 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ Why?
L556333 +++$+++ u7980 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZALTAR +++$+++ But it's impossible.
L556332 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ I knew it!
L556331 +++$+++ u7980 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZALTAR +++$+++ There is a way.
