L654914 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.
L654913 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
L654694 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ I'd like that.
L654693 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour.
L655342 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ It's Homicide's job now, Ray, let 'em do it.  I'll tell you something else, there's more to this story than you know, Ray... If Suzie is dead, I think Hunter may be on the right track...
L655341 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
L655340 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
L655339 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Where's Lombardo?
L655338 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.
L655299 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise.
L655298 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
L655297 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...
L655296 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What if I'm right, Gloria?  What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong?  What do you do if you see a bad thing coming?
L655295 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Ray, you heard him...
L655294 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Will you do me one favor?
L655291 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ We don't know that, Ray...
L655290 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
L655286 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You don't think Sam could've put it there?
L655285 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.
L655284 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.
L655283 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Where's the body?
L655282 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
L655281 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
L655262 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Just check out the car.
L655261 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ If you want company...
L655260 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ You have someplace to be?
L655259 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
L655258 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
L655257 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...
L655217 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again.
L655216 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ We all have...
L655215 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it?
L655214 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ You could say that.
L655213 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Guess I kind of lost it there.
L655206 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  Cone on.  She bought the same story we did...
L655205 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life.
L655126 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I net a guy in a bar.
L655125 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
L655124 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You got it.  The rich got richer.  While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp.
L655123 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Eliminate the competition.
L655122 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
L655121 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
L655120 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Her father didn't leave her squat.  The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.
L655119 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother?  Surely her father...
L655117 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ The job looks okay to us.  But look at it from his point of view.  The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege.  But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his.
L655116 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
L655115 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start.
L655114 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday.
L655113 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Unless what?
L655112 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...
L655111 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
L655110 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
L655107 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Lombardo's settlement?
L655106 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You saw the news today?
L654954 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
L654953 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.
L654952 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
L654951 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
L654950 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ The skinny brunette.
L654949 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?
L654947 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
L654946 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.
L654942 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard, we're going to wind up looking stupid.
L654941 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You're telling me you believe the guy?
L654940 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it.  With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his.
L654936 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her.  I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?
L654935 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Same as him.  They saw her come.  They saw her go.  They saw him follow.
L654851 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do.  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary.
L654850 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ It's our job, Gloria.
L654845 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
L654844 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
L654692 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Back to the land of grownups.
L654691 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I've got that two o'clock in town.
L655003 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ He said, "No little bitch can ever make me come."
L655002 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ What was that?
L655001 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ He did say something.
L654999 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
L654998 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ At that point were you able to fight him off?
L654987 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ I guess.
L654986 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Did he come in with you?
L654985 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Yes.
L654984 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ So you were alone.
L654983 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ No.
L654982 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
L654981 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L654980 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ He dropped Jimmy off first?
L654979 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ About a year ago.
L654978 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us.  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?
L654977 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.
L654974 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Why is that?
L654973 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Yeah, maybe, a little.
L654972 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ That bothers you?
L654848 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ I don't care.  You heard that girl's statement.  I think he's dirty.  Get me a case.
L654847 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
L654846 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ I want a full-scale investigation.
L654843 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years.  We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers.
L654842 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ Where's this coming from?
L654841 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ That doesn't make him a child rapist.  There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away...
L654838 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
L654837 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ Why?
L655362 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass.
L655361 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ The teeth, were they...
L655359 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door...  I think I looked away.  A split second. Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts a knee into my groin.  There was this coffee table between us and the wall.  She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could hear it breaking.  I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough.  Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice. I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think. In the chest.
L655358 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ You didn't cuff her?
L655357 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.
L655356 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom.
L655355 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ She bit you?
L655353 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder.  I did her rights.
L655352 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ Just tell us what happened.
L655351 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I fucked up.  I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do?
L655293 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.
L655292 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Kelly's next, Gloria.
L655209 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead...
L655208 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ Oh, Ray... no...
L655204 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
L655203 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
L655202 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
L655201 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ Are you crazy, Ray?
L654934 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ And what do they say?
L654933 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
L654932 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ What about witnesses?
L654931 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her.  That's bullshit.
L654840 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ The line I get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay.
L654839 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...
L655037 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ Your Honor... Please...
L655036 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed.
L655026 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ I'm sorry?
L655025 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ This wasn't my idea.
L655024 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ Ms. Toller.  I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?
L655023 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ I said he did.
L655022 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ Ms. Toller?
L655020 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Because... it was the biggest I've ever seen.  And I've seen a lot on their way through Jack's Fish Camp.
L655019 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
L655018 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
L654997 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?
L654996 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
L654995 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
L654994 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ What did you do then?
L654991 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ I wanna go home now.
L654990 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
L654989 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Yeah... okay... he did
L654988 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ You guess?  Did he or didn't he?
L654711 +++$+++ u8911 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Yeah.  But I got my bike.
L654710 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ A ride.  You want one?
L654709 +++$+++ u8911 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ What?
L654708 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
L654700 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hey, you're working for it.  Least you're supposed to be.
L654699 +++$+++ u8911 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class...  No way was my old man going to spring for the fees...
L654674 +++$+++ u8911 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate.
L654673 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Thank you, Jimmy.
L654672 +++$+++ u8911 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ No!
L654671 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?
L655277 +++$+++ u8911 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Yeah, but...
L655276 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
L655275 +++$+++ u8911 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
L655274 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I say something funny?
L655273 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Lombardo ever come out here?
L655272 +++$+++ u8911 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
L655271 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You and Suzie used to come out here together?
L655270 +++$+++ u8911 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ It's those rocks, up there.

L655234 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ I wanna live at the beach someday.
L655233 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I think we just need to get wasted.
L655232 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ I thought we were goin' to a movie.
L655231 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Nothing.
L655230 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ What are you looking at?
L655229 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ What brain?
L655228 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
L655195 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
L655194 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ You are.
L655193 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Oh, for Christ's sake.
L655192 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
L655174 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You can trust me.
L655173 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
L655172 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
L655145 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Man, I wanna smoke a joint.
L655144 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
L655143 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
L655142 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
L655253 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'm not on your property!
L655252 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Get off my property.
L655138 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Police -- God -- get a life.
L655137 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
L655136 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I've been a cop for a while, Kelly.  It's hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three.  And then there's the love angle.  I mean do you and Sam really want that little pill-head around, now that you have the money?
L655135 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You're out of your mind.
L655134 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.
L655133 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
L655132 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Excuse me?
L655130 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ About what?  How to improve your breast stroke?
L655129 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Curiosity, I guess.
L655128 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Is there some reason why you're here?
L655269 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ A friend of mine bought a boat.
L655268 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Where, the mall?
L655267 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
L655266 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
L655265 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
L654802 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Yes.  God, Mom...
L654801 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ He... Sam Lombardo?
