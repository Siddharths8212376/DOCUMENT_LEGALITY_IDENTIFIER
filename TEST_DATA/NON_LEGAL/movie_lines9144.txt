L290060 +++$+++ u1400 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ STUCKY +++$+++ Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
L290059 +++$+++ u1390 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ CAPT. SPAULDING +++$+++ I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
L290058 +++$+++ u1400 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ STUCKY +++$+++ Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
L290057 +++$+++ u1390 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ CAPT. SPAULDING +++$+++ Goddamn.
L290056 +++$+++ u1400 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ STUCKY +++$+++ Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
L290055 +++$+++ u1390 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ CAPT. SPAULDING +++$+++ I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
L290054 +++$+++ u1400 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ STUCKY +++$+++ Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just spins it around next to his eyeball.
L290053 +++$+++ u1390 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ CAPT. SPAULDING +++$+++ What?
L290052 +++$+++ u1400 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ STUCKY +++$+++ Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
L290051 +++$+++ u1390 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ CAPT. SPAULDING +++$+++ Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
L290050 +++$+++ u1400 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ STUCKY +++$+++ Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.
L290049 +++$+++ u1390 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ CAPT. SPAULDING +++$+++ Christ, ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat.

L290047 +++$+++ u1390 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ CAPT. SPAULDING +++$+++ Fascinating.
L290046 +++$+++ u1400 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ STUCKY +++$+++ Yeah, he's all hot on her after he found some of his dad's old nudie books hidden in the basement. He keeps 'em taped inside his school workbook.
L290045 +++$+++ u1390 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ CAPT. SPAULDING +++$+++ The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
L290044 +++$+++ u1400 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ STUCKY +++$+++ Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb.
L290043 +++$+++ u1390 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ CAPT. SPAULDING +++$+++ Hmmmmm.
L290042 +++$+++ u1400 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ STUCKY +++$+++ I... I got back a stack today. Some nice shots.  See, a good topless June Wilkinson... unfortunately she personalized it...  to Stucky, love June.
L290516 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ He tried to burn the house down, said it was possessed by the spirits. Tiny was sleeping in the basement where the fire started. I don't think Earl ever meant to harm us... but Tiny was badly burnt, his ears were destroyed and most of his skin.
L290515 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
L290514 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
L290513 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Oh.
L290512 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't hear so much.
L290508 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.
L290507 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ You sure you don't need any help in there?
L290492 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ How's he get around out here?
L290491 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle.
L290488 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ He should be back in a couple hours.
L290487 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ How long is that gonna take?
L290475 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Yeah, I guess I'll just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters.
L290474 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ That's nice.
L290473 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house...  ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down.
L290458 +++$+++ u1396 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.
L290457 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone?
L290882 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Help, help us.
L290881 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
L290880 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
L290879 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ That was good babe, just keep doing that.
L290878 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.
L290877 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
L290876 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
L290875 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ We've got get out of here, we got get out of here.
L290595 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Shhhhhh.
L290594 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ You gotta be kidding me. This chick is wasted.
L290581 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ This isn't funny, it's twisted.
L290580 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I don't know, I think he's funny.
L290579 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ What are you laughing at?
L290506 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Shhhhhh.
L290505 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
L290504 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Really, now is not the time to make waves.
L290499 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
L290498 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Thank you.
L290451 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Dude, your chick's a little high strung.
L290450 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
L290449 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
L290393 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ When you were outside with Bill.
L290392 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ When?
L290391 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
L290385 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
L290384 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
L290383 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
L290382 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ So what?
L290381 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
L290380 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Yeah?
L290379 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
L290378 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Why?
L290377 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
L290376 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ So.
L290375 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
L290374 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
L290373 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
L290372 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Oh, yeah.
L290371 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
L290370 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Fuck, it's freezing.
L290237 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ That seems likely.
L290236 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Hey, maybe she knows where this is?
L290217 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Fried chicken.  Anybody want some?
L290216 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Ugh, what's that smell?
L290182 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun.
L290181 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Aw, come on. It will be fun.
L290179 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ I don't want to see that.
L290178 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
L290177 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Tickets for what?
L290176 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.
L290131 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Grab Mary and come inside.
L290130 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Huh?
L290201 +++$+++ u1397 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MR. WILLIS +++$+++ Well, just promise me you'll be careful... alright, alright see ya soon... good-bye.
L290200 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home... yes, Dad I'm kidding.
L290199 +++$+++ u1397 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MR. WILLIS +++$+++ Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
L290198 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
L290197 +++$+++ u1397 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MR. WILLIS +++$+++ Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.
L290196 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.
L290195 +++$+++ u1397 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MR. WILLIS +++$+++ Hello...  ...hey Denise... what, what's wrong, did you break down?
L290524 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yeah, it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place.
L290523 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Don't be such a fucking smart ass.
L290490 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
L290489 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ A couple hours!
L290455 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
L290454 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
L290422 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
L290421 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Jesus Christ.
L290415 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there.
L290414 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I still don't.
L290413 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Shhhhhh, quiet.
L290412 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I don't hear anything.
L290410 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Wait... quiet. Turn off the radio.
L290409 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ What? I didn't hear anything.
L290408 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What was that?
L290407 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ I don't know... about half an hour.
L290406 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ How long has it been?
L290395 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Yeah, she said we looked queer.
L290394 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.
L290343 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ I can't believe...
L290342 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I think I'm going fucking crazy.
L290304 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ God damn it, I knew this witch-hunt was fucking bullshit.
L290303 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ You got to be fucking joking.
L290302 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Don't even say it.
L290242 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ She looks like she stinks.
L290241 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Stick her in the front, if you want to pick her up so bad. She's soaked.
L290229 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see anything now, it's too dark. Let's forget it.
L290228 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway.
L290211 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Maybe he's a cyborg.
L290210 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
L290209 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Geez, he never gets tired does he.
L290175 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Exactly... well, I guess a couple more photos won't kill me.
L290174 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Scattered, smothered and covered.
L290173 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl.
L290172 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.
L290171 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
L290170 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
L290169 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.
L290167 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's?
L290166 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
L290165 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Tell me about it.
L290164 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.
L290141 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Aw, shit...  I gotta pee anyway.
L290140 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
L290139 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
L290138 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
L290137 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I resign.
L290136 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
L290135 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No please, let me sit this one out.
L290134 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Rise and shine.
L290133 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Sleeping.
L290132 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.
L290726 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ Yep, I found something.
L290725 +++$+++ u1393 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ HUSTON +++$+++ You find something, Georgie?
L290724 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ God damn.
L290715 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ Yep, I suppose it is.
L290714 +++$+++ u1393 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ HUSTON +++$+++ That's the understatement of the year.
L290713 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
L290712 +++$+++ u1393 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ HUSTON +++$+++ Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.
L290711 +++$+++ u1401 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ WYDELL +++$+++ Not yet.
L290710 +++$+++ u1393 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ HUSTON +++$+++ Recover any bodies?
