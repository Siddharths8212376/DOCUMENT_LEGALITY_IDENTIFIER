L430711 +++$+++ u6943 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ HIM +++$+++ Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.
L430710 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Sure.
L430681 +++$+++ u6943 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ HIM +++$+++ It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.
L430680 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
L430679 +++$+++ u6943 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ HIM +++$+++ Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
L430678 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Yes?
L430677 +++$+++ u6943 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ HIM +++$+++ Wait.
L430676 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
L430675 +++$+++ u6943 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ HIM +++$+++ I'll look forward to it.
L430673 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You would?  Really?
L430672 +++$+++ u6943 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ HIM +++$+++ Sure.
L430671 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
L430670 +++$+++ u6943 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ HIM +++$+++ Well, not exactly...
L430669 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Any night.
L430668 +++$+++ u6943 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ HIM +++$+++ Tonight?
L430667 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
L430664 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I just got here, too.  Not yesterday.  But, just now.  Today. Just a few minutes ago.  Yeah, we just got here...  I mean, I just got here.  I'm single.
L430663 +++$+++ u6943 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ HIM +++$+++ Just since yesterday.
L430662 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Been here long?
L430661 +++$+++ u6943 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ HIM +++$+++ Sure is.
L430660 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Beautiful place...
L430659 +++$+++ u6943 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ HIM +++$+++ Hello.
L430647 +++$+++ u6943 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ HIM +++$+++ Uh huh.
L430646 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You're Damon Bradley?
L430941 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Larry, did you rent a car?
L430940 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
L430939 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?
L430840 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
L430839 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ What about Larry?
L430838 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ And Larry?...
L430837 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.
L430836 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Oh.
L430835 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
L430834 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
L430833 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I didn't expect you back so soon.
L430832 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Uh huh.
L430831 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Kate is that you?
L430816 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
L430815 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ So...
L430797 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ When you could've found one in America.
L430796 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
L430795 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Yup.
L430794 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
L430793 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Yes.  He is.
L430792 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ He's a jerk.
L430775 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
L430774 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
L430773 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
L430772 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Maybe I can change him.
L430769 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.
L430768 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ And he is living proof.
L430767 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ No one's perfect, Kate.
L430766 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says "nuculear" and "irregardless".
L430762 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
L430761 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
L430653 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Faith, I'm kidding.  Is this how you plan to get what you want from life?  When you finally find it, you turn and run away from it?
L430652 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ My God... you're right.
L430651 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
L430650 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ What if he doesn't like me?
L430649 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Whatareyoudoing?!
L430622 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Is Damon Bradley here?
L430621 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Joan Collins stayed here.
L430610 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
L430609 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Amazing...
L430608 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
L430607 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Peter found him?
L430554 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ I'll be back before you leave.
L430553 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.
L430552 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ You sure you'll be okay?
L430551 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ No.  No, you go ahead.
L430548 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ I'm just not ready to go home quite yet, that's all.
L430547 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ What?
L430546 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Who said I was going?
L430545 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
L430544 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
L430543 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ What about Peter?...
L430542 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be.  I've got forty-eight hours.  I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
L430541 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ ...and a fortune teller.
L430540 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ It was a ouija board, remember?
L430539 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ I know, but...
L430538 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
L430537 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ So you're just quitting?  Just like that?
L430536 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place?  Children are very impressionable, you know.
L430535 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Okay, a lot of bad luck.  But that means the odds are probably in your favor now.  This is no time to give up.
L430534 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ A little bad luck?
L430533 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ So, you've had a little bad luck.
L430532 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
L430531 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Why?
L430530 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Packing.
L430529 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
L430528 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Hi.  Where've you been?
L430527 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Hi-iii...
L430492 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Men have ways.
L430491 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ But how could he know?  He only just met me.
L430490 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Yeah.  Sociopaths.  They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
L430379 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
L430378 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ No... Like a psychiatrist.
L430377 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Like a detective.
L430376 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ I think it's time we got some professional help.
L430375 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I meant about my idea.
L430374 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ That was really sweet...
L430368 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him.
L430367 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ And then what, Faith?
L430366 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
L430365 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Well, nobody can say we didn't try.
L430363 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Good luck.
L430362 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ What?
L430361 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Faith--
L430360 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Right.  Okay...  It's meant to be right?  This is it.
L430359 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
L430358 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
L430354 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Nope.
L430353 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Is he looking at us?
L430352 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
L430351 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Oh my God.  Where?
L430350 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ He's heeeeeerrre...
L430349 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?
L430348 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
L430347 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Sure you did.
L430346 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ I never even got to be single.
L430345 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Because I'm the one who's single.
L430344 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
L430343 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I told you.  If he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think I'm here with another guy.  I just don't want to send any confusing signals.
L430342 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ So what's in a name?  I wanna join him.  I don't see why we can't join him.
L430335 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
L430334 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
L430331 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ You're right.  At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself.  Smile.
L430330 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous.  God, I hate blind dates.  Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America?
L430301 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ What's she saying?
L430300 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
L430299 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ What did you say to her?
L430292 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Right.  My brother.
L430291 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Her brother.
L430290 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know how happy I am to meet you.  You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--
L430262 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Polo.
L430261 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Larry bought himself cologne?
L430260 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day.  Did I tell you that?
L430258 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.
L430257 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ That was a long time ago.
L430254 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ You know, when Larry and I got married, I thought we were so lucky we found each other so early. People talk about spending their lives together, how many of them really get to?  But maybe I was wrong.  Maybe sooner or later everything wears out.
L430253 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ 'Course he does.
L430252 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ You think he misses me at all?
L430251 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
L430250 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
L430249 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Sorry.
L430248 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
L430247 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You expecting somebody you know?
L430244 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Nothing.
L430243 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ What's that supposed to mean?...
L430242 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
L430241 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ I'm hungry.
L430239 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Right.  So we should've been able to cover more of them.
L430238 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
L430237 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I told you a liter was less than a gallon.
L430235 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.
L430234 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Couldn't we just have taken a train?
L430227 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
L430226 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Your brother?
L430214 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Only, it's in Italian...
L430213 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Only what?
L430212 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ A phone message.  Only--
L430211 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ What is it?
L430210 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ We're saved!
L430208 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Oh.  Right.
L430207 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
L430206 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
L430205 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ A rich, possibly fat, slob.
L430204 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ A Butterfinger wrapper.
L430203 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ What'd you find?
L430202 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Ah ha!...
L430199 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
L430198 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ So?
L430197 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
L430196 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ I just got a dial tone--
L430194 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ I don't think he understood what you were saying.  What's the airport number?
L430193 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
L430192 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
L430187 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ He fell out.
L430186 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ What are you doing?
L430183 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
L430182 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
L430181 +++$+++ u6944 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
