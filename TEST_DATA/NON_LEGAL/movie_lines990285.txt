L500152 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
L500151 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ The man we know and love.
L500150 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ -- which is a hack.
L500149 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ -- which is --
L500148 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What I am.
L500147 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ -- instead of what he is --
L500146 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ It was you, Juliet, it was you --
L500145 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
L500142 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Not usually this drunk.
L500141 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I'm not usually drunk.
L500120 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ He even signs them, in his own name, can you believe it? I'd sign someone else's name. I'd sign his name. If I wrote them, that is. Which I don't.
L500119 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Alex.
L500118 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Aroused and inflamed.
L500117 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'
L500116 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ So we'll meet him, then?
L500108 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.
L500107 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Who was it?
L500101 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
L500100 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things.
L500060 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ -- I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't she?
L500059 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ -- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
L500058 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Well, she had problems --
L500057 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ She hated you --
L500056 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
L500055 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ For the flat.
L500054 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
L500053 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
L500052 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing.
L500051 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.
L500050 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ I thought you stopped going.
L500044 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Just serve.
L500043 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Did you know --
L500030 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love.
L500029 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are the sunshine of my life'?
L500024 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?
L500023 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear?
L500018 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
L500017 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?
L499990 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Really?
L499989 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Yes.
L499988 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Cameron?
L499987 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Cameron.
L500160 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ Yeah.
L500159 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Can you afford this place?
L500137 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Well, that's what I said, isn't it?
L500136 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ You mean I can have the room?
L500135 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ It's OK. There's no problem.
L500131 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What was I trying to say? Oh, yes, I think, we think, or at least I suppose we think -- am I right?
L500130 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ You were going to say something.
L500129 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What?
L500128 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ What?
L500127 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ So, uh...
L500123 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yeah, well, that's what she said. Interesting. That's why you're here, you see.
L500122 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ I see.
L500121 +++$+++ u7574 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Interesting.
L500626 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ That wasn't a question.
L500625 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yes.
L500624 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ You're sure of that.
L500623 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No, I've never seen them.
L500524 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yeah, that's right, that's it.
L500523 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Is this where no one stays?
L500522 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Someone lost the key.
L500521 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.
L500520 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
L500519 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
L500518 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
L500517 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
L500516 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I see.
L500513 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Take a note of that, Mitchell. Only three, rather than four. Write it down. You can use numbers or words, I have no preference. Which are you using?
L500512 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yes, absolutely.
L500511 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
L500510 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No, three. Who said there were four?
L500509 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
L500508 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Who said there were four?
L500507 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Two?
L500506 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ There are only two other people in the flat.
L500505 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
L500504 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Of course.
L500503 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
L500502 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No, nothing, sorry.
L500501 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
L500500 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
L500499 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ did you hear anything before he cries?
L500498 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.
L500497 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Can we come in?
L500496 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Of course.
L500495 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Downstairs.
L500494 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Burglary?
L500493 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ It's about the burglary.
L500492 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What about?
L500491 +++$+++ u7582 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
L500705 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.
L500704 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ It wasn't like that.
L500703 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.
L500701 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.
L500700 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ What?
L500699 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
L500698 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Eh, I don't know.
L500691 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ And you need your sleep.
L500690 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Yes.
L500673 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You and me?
L500672 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ So let's go.
L500588 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ It was on the television.
L500587 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ We already know. All about it.
L500576 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ I should hope so.
L500575 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L500562 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ With a face like this?
L500561 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I thought you'd gone to work.
L500546 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ If I think you're lying --
L500545 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ No one.
L500544 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Who have you talked to?
L500543 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ No one. I promise.
L500542 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
L500541 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ No.
L500540 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
L500539 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ What?
L500538 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Expecting anyone?
L500402 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet.
L500401 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ That's what it cost, David.
L500400 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You paid two hundred pounds for this?
L500399 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Two hundred pounds.
L500398 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Two hundred pounds?
L500397 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Two hundred.
L500374 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ That was stressful. I found that stressful.
L500373 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
L500372 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L500371 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
L500332 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Yes. They're my friends.
L500331 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Do you know many of these people?
L500320 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No.
L500319 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Would you like to talk about it?
L500318 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
L500317 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Are you all right?
L500213 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
L500212 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I've never seen a dead body before.
L500196 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Yes.
L500195 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Is this what they always look like?
L500133 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
L500132 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Just get on with it, Alex.
L500028 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Did you ever kill a man?
L500027 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
L500022 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
L500021 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not.
L500016 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Do you smoke?
L500015 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Why do you want a room here?
L500265 +++$+++ u7581 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ LUMSDEN +++$+++ Which is why I'm trusting you with this account.
L500264 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
L500263 +++$+++ u7581 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ LUMSDEN +++$+++ You get the job done.
L500262 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm boring?
L500261 +++$+++ u7581 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ LUMSDEN +++$+++ And that's why I think you fit in here.
L500260 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L500259 +++$+++ u7581 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ LUMSDEN +++$+++ Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
L500258 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm not sure --
L500257 +++$+++ u7581 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ LUMSDEN +++$+++ But they sneer, don't they?
L500256 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Eh --
L500255 +++$+++ u7581 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ LUMSDEN +++$+++ There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?
L500254 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Not any real sneering as such, no.
L500253 +++$+++ u7581 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ LUMSDEN +++$+++ -- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
L500252 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Exactly what I was --
L500251 +++$+++ u7581 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ LUMSDEN +++$+++ Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
L500250 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
L500249 +++$+++ u7581 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ LUMSDEN +++$+++ In this firm.
L500248 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Right here?
L500247 +++$+++ u7581 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ LUMSDEN +++$+++ Here.
L500246 +++$+++ u7576 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Sorry?
L500245 +++$+++ u7581 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ LUMSDEN +++$+++ What do we do here, David?
L500244 +++$+++ u7577 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ That's what I thought.
L500243 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Oh, him. Well, he died.
L500242 +++$+++ u7577 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
L500241 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Here?.
L500240 +++$+++ u7577 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ That one, last week.
L500239 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ What guy that died?
L500238 +++$+++ u7577 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ That guy, the one that died.
L500237 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ What guy?
L500236 +++$+++ u7577 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ What happened to that guy?
L500235 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Hello.
L500099 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ No, but like all novelists, I'm in search of the self.
L500098 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ And that's not the same thing?
L500097 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ I write about it?
L500096 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ You know about it?
L500095 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ The human condition.
L500094 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ A certain weakness.
L500093 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ For what?
L500092 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ No. But he needs treatment.
L500091 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ And he's a patient of yours?
L500090 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ I'm a doctor.
L500089 +++$+++ u7579 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ HUGO +++$+++ Working nights?
L500088 +++$+++ u7580 +++$+++ m512 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week.
