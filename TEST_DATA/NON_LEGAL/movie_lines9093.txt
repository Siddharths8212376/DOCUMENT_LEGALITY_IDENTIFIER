L239475 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ So far so good.
L239474 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.
L239473 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.
L239301 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.
L239300 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
L239245 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.  Dana?  The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
L239244 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
L239163 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
L239162 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ That's it?  "I'll be back?"
L239157 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.
L239156 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ "Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"
L238930 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ You need the exercise.
L238929 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ You were supposed to help me with this.
L238911 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ I knew that.
L238910 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ That's a thousand million electron volts.
L238899 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Finding something abnormal on the street shouldn't be too hard.
L238898 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
L238897 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ What now, Brainiac?
L238884 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?
L238883 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ I'd like to have a stool specimen
L238855 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ I don't even want to know where that is.
L238854 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
L238853 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
L238852 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ Hello, Venkman.
L238851 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Egon!
L239491 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Do it!  Just do it!
L239490 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!
L239431 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ Something good --
L239430 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
L239429 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ We need something that everyone can get behind, a symbol --
L239428 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
L239427 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
L239286 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.
L239285 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.
L239255 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ Nine feet -- ten --
L239254 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ That's it.  It's on the bottom.
L239253 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ Six feet -- seven -- eight --
L239161 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, "Death is but a door, time is but a window.  I'll be back."
L239160 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ No, not exactly a man of the people.  "Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."
L239052 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ And we're the ...
L239051 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ I'm Egon --
L238989 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
L238988 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
L238964 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ His nickname is "The Hammer."
L238963 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
L238941 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ What's the reading?
L238940 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
L238939 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
L238907 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
L238906 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Nothing.  Not a trace.
L238844 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ Good idea.
L238843 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
L238842 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
L238841 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
L238840 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ Who was that?
L239508 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ There's something very familiar about this painting.
L239507 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
L239297 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ And it's all flowing toward the museum.
L239296 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ Rivers of the stuff!
L239257 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ No, the slime is rising.
L239256 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ Is the line sinking?
L239196 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ I'd put my money on that Vigo character.
L239195 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ There's definitely something going on in that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red.
L239111 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
L239110 +++$+++ u1131 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ SPENGLER +++$+++ We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
L239535 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.
L239534 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ What's your story, Pete?
L239529 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall.  How about you, Winston?
L239528 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.
L239520 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.
L239519 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?
L239488 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.
L239487 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
L239480 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ She's new in town.
L239479 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ My Fault!
L239478 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
L239477 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
L239466 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Are you kidding?  We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th.  I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth.  Trust me, I used to drive a cab.
L239465 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.
L239450 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?
L239449 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
L239426 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
L239425 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
L239416 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ I hate Jello.
L239415 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ It looks like a giant Jello mold.
L239295 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ It's all over the city, Pete -- well, under it actually.
L239294 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
L239293 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ You should've been there, Venkman. Absolutely incredible!
L239249 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Okay, but you're missing all the fun.
L239248 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find out.
L239243 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Darn it!  I wish I'd known you were going. I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.
L239242 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
L239241 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
L239206 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
L239205 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ What happened?
L239186 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ I'll get one more reading.
L239185 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.
L239155 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:
L239154 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Did you find anything at Dana's?
L239116 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ You're not sleeping with this stuff, are you?
L239115 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
L239114 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ What kind of tests?
L239113 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
L239112 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Like a goat on garbage.
L239109 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ 'Mood slime.'  We ought to bottle this stuff and sell it.
L239108 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
L239107 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ This is what you do with your spare time?
L239102 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
L239101 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ And now you're going to eat it?
L239099 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
L239098 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
L239065 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
L239064 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
L239057 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ I guess so, Pete, because that's not all. Tell them what else we've got, Egon.
L239056 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
L239055 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Careful, Winston.  He's a mean one.  And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan.
L239050 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ I'm Peter --
L239049 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ I'm Ray --
L239034 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Okay, let's heat 'em up!
L239033 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
L238920 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Relax.  We're going to keep this whole thing nice and quiet, low key, no profile.
L238919 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
L238918 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to make some headlines with this one.
L238909 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.
L238908 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ What's that?
L238896 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.
L238895 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Well, Holmes, what do you think?
L238865 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Dana!  Dana Barrett!
L238864 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Who, Ray?
L238863 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
L238862 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Who?  Who?  Who?
L238861 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Oh, Ray --
L238860 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Who?  Just -- someone we know.
L238859 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Who?
L238858 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
L238857 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Great.  So what are you guys working on?
L238850 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.
L238849 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
L238848 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
L238847 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ So, no goat hooves, huh?
L238846 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Oh, hiya, Pete.
L238845 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.
L239494 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.
L239493 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
L239459 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk.
L239458 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ She's moving!
L239289 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
L239288 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
L239284 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.
L239283 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
L239282 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
L239281 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
L239208 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.
L239207 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ Are you all right?
L239202 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Well don't think!
L239201 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ No, I just thought --
L239200 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Are you telling me how to drive?
L239192 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for a second there.  Let's go.
L239191 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
L239190 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ What?  Yeah.
L239189 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ You finished here?
L239188 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Huh?  What?
L239187 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ Now that's one ugly dude.
L239171 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Now if you don't want to be the --  -- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock from a planar rift, I suggest you get down behind that desk and don't move until we give you the signal "Stabilize -- All Clear."
L239170 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ You got a flux and a half.
L239159 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.
L239158 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
L239119 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
L239118 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ Does it have any favorites?
L238771 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow.
L238770 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
L238769 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.
L238768 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year these kids won't even remember who we are.
L238767 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Come on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The holidays are coming up.  It's our best season.
L238766 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds.
L238755 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Then let's do it.
L238754 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ I'm ready.
L238753 +++$+++ u1132 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Ready?
L239531 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Miss Blue Blood?  Her family's been here since the year 12.
L239530 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ My people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man.  And there wasn't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them, either.  What are you, Dana?
L239463 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.
L239462 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.
L239447 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ If she's naked under that toga.  She's French, you know.
L239446 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ Wonder what?
L239445 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
L239433 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ And decent.
L239432 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ And pure --
L239374 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
L239373 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
L239340 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
L239339 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ Tell him about the toaster.
L239123 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ So we'll put a warning on the label.
L239122 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
L239121 +++$+++ u1133 +++$+++ m74 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.
L239796 +++$+++ u1136 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ BRIDE +++$+++ What's the matter, dear?
L239795 +++$+++ u1141 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ GROOM +++$+++ Uuuuuuugh!!
L239794 +++$+++ u1136 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ BRIDE +++$+++ Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!
L239792 +++$+++ u1136 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ BRIDE +++$+++ Have I done the right thing?
L239791 +++$+++ u1141 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ GROOM +++$+++ To the bathroom, where do you think?
L239790 +++$+++ u1136 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ BRIDE +++$+++ Now where are you going?
