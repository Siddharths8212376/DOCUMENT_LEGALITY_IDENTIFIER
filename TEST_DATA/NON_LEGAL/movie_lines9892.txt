L263183 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I am.  You-you made my day.
L263182 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Oh, God!
L263181 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed.
L263180 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Oh!
L263179 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
L263178 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Right.
L263177 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
L263176 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
L263175 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
L263174 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Oh, it just came to me one day.
L263173 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
L263172 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Really?
L263171 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
L263170 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think.
L263166 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I should have kept going.  I-I have a sneaking feeling, a nagging sensation I should've kept walking and...
L263165 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Oh, well.
L263164 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Well, what about me?
L263163 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Hmm.  I think it's lucky I ran into you.  Maybe.
L263162 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You must be joking.  I've been doing all my own reading since I was forty...you know.
L263161 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Come over tomorrow and read it to me?
L263160 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
L263159 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
L263158 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one.
L263157 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Really?
L263156 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Oh, no!  It wasn't anything bad. But she just... you know.  I don't know.
L263155 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Oh, well, God, I can imagine what you wrote.
L263154 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ ...Hannah read it, she got really angry, and... you know, then I felt badly, so I--
L263153 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Yeah.
L263152 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...
L263151 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Hmm.
L263150 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script.
L263149 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.
L263148 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
L263147 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
L263146 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Oh, I'm fine.
L263145 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
L263144 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ You're okay, though, huh?
L263143 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...which is a long, dull story and I won't get into it.  But--
L263142 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Oh.  Oh.
L263141 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year...
L263140 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I've done no television whatsoever. No.
L263139 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ You're kidding me.
L263138 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
L263137 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
L263136 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You have.
L263135 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ No, I haven't.
L263134 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You've always hated my taste in the past.
L263133 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ No, the reason I ask is--
L263132 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.
L263131 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?
L263130 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Really?
L263129 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Nobody ever said it.
L263128 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
L263127 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ No, I am.  I am.
L263126 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Come on.
L263125 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ No, you can tell me.
L263124 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
L263123 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
L263122 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Yeah.
L263121 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Have you?
L263120 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ No, well...I've been trying to write.
L263119 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Are you, are you out of work or something?
L263118 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Probably not.
L263117 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?
L263116 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ ...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
L263115 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Well...
L263114 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Oh, nothing much.  You know...
L263113 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
L263112 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ I'm okay.
L263111 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ So how are you?
L263110 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...namely a personality.
L263109 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
L263108 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
L263107 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Well, I hope you've changed.
L263106 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ People change...you know.
L263105 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
L263104 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
L263103 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...in a really horrible way.
L263102 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ I'd never do that.
L263101 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Remember slamming the cab door in my face and..  you know, it came very dangerously close to emasculating my nose in a... 
L263100 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Yeah, it was.
L263099 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ It was a terrible evening.
L263098 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Yeah?
L263097 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
L263096 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Oh, no.
L263095 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You look wonderful.
L263094 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ I'm fine.
L263093 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Good.  How are you?
L263092 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ How are you?
L263091 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots.
L263090 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ We didn't hit it off.
L263089 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
L263088 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Yeah.
L263087 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I was walking past and I saw you in here...
L263086 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ I recall you.
L263085 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Yes, you do recall, right?
L263084 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ I remember you.
L263083 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.
L262744 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials.
L262743 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ God!
L262742 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
L262741 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
L262740 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Yeah.  Me, too.
L262739 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
L262738 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Jesus...  I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people.  Really.
L262737 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
L262736 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
L262735 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ At least I'm open to new concepts!
L262734 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!
L262733 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ I was so bored!
L262732 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
L262731 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Thanks for a swell time.
L262726 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Now come on, you're be--, 'cause you're being angry at me.
L262725 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
L262724 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
L262723 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
L262722 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
L262721 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
L262720 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
L262718 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ My--uh...
L262717 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ No!
L262716 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Can we, can we go?
L262715 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ But, no, you've been doing that all night!  You're gonna...you're gonna burn a hole in your... You're gonna develop a third nostril!  Really,  don't, please.
L262714 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Come on, Mickey.  Come on.
L262711 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ You want some?
L262710 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Don't, no, please.  Will you-- No, don't...
L262708 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Look, can't you feel the energy? It's tangible energy!  The room's alive with positive vibrations!
L262707 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
L262706 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Listen, you are witnessing genius!
L262705 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I can't hear you.  I can't hear anything.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear!  I'm--
L262704 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Oh, why are you making those faces?
L262971 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while!  I'm just suffocating. 
L262970 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Why are you so upset?
L262953 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ I just want a salad.  You really think I'm a loser, don't you?
L262952 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Boy...Holly...Holly.
L262951 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?
L262950 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
L262936 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Hmm.
L262935 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.

L262991 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.
