L575193 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
L575192 +++$+++ u8132 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ FEATHER +++$+++ Of the deal, man.
L575191 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ All of what?
L575190 +++$+++ u8132 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ FEATHER +++$+++ He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
L575189 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
L575188 +++$+++ u8132 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ FEATHER +++$+++ Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
L575187 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Eh?
L575186 +++$+++ u8132 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ FEATHER +++$+++ It was you.  Downtown.
L575185 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
L575184 +++$+++ u8132 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ FEATHER +++$+++ So what's your beef, pal?
L575183 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
L575182 +++$+++ u8132 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ FEATHER +++$+++ That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
L575181 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
L575180 +++$+++ u8132 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ FEATHER +++$+++ Yeah, I guess you are.
L575179 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
L575178 +++$+++ u8132 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ FEATHER +++$+++ But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
L575177 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
L575176 +++$+++ u8132 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ FEATHER +++$+++ Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.
L575175 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.
L575174 +++$+++ u8132 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ FEATHER +++$+++ There's one thing I don't understand.  The thing I don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.
L575220 +++$+++ u8133 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ FIELDING +++$+++ He had urgent business in the north.
L575219 +++$+++ u8134 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ GRAMMS +++$+++ Where is he now?
L575218 +++$+++ u8133 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ FIELDING +++$+++ He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
L575217 +++$+++ u8134 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ GRAMMS +++$+++ So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
L575216 +++$+++ u8133 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ FIELDING +++$+++ My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
L575215 +++$+++ u8134 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ GRAMMS +++$+++ Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
L575214 +++$+++ u8133 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ FIELDING +++$+++ Deals?  My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific.
L575213 +++$+++ u8134 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ GRAMMS +++$+++ A <u>statement</u>?  I wouldn't mind getting a statement.  You see, <u>my</u> client -- the United States Government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client.
L575212 +++$+++ u8133 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ FIELDING +++$+++ My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
L575211 +++$+++ u8134 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ GRAMMS +++$+++ Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
L574979 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Yeah.  Cheers, mate.
L574978 +++$+++ u8135 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
L574977 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
L574976 +++$+++ u8135 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
L574975 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ No kidding.
L574974 +++$+++ u8135 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
L574973 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Yeah?
L574972 +++$+++ u8135 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ That's too bad.  Ian's got a good thing going over there.
L574971 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Unless I'm not who I think I am.
L574970 +++$+++ u8135 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ You sure?
L574969 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Sorry.  Wasn't me.
L574968 +++$+++ u8135 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
L574967 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Ian?
L574966 +++$+++ u8135 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ Don't you work with Ian?
L575380 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Yeah.
L575379 +++$+++ u8136 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ LADY +++$+++ The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
L575378 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ But first I gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking.
L575377 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Could do, yeah.
L575376 +++$+++ u8136 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ LADY +++$+++ Sounds like you need a rest.
L575375 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
L575374 +++$+++ u8136 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ LADY +++$+++ But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
L575373 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
L575372 +++$+++ u8136 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ LADY +++$+++ Nine years?  Is that legal?
L575371 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.
L575370 +++$+++ u8136 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ LADY +++$+++ Where else?
L575369 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Been away a lot.
L575368 +++$+++ u8136 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ LADY +++$+++ No rest for the wicked.
L575367 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
L575366 +++$+++ u8136 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ LADY +++$+++ You'll be looking forward to getting back, then.
L575364 +++$+++ u8136 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ LADY +++$+++ You're a reluctant traveller, then.
L575363 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ I would have preferred staying home, me.
L575362 +++$+++ u8136 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ LADY +++$+++ I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
L575361 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Yeah, that's right.
L575263 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
L575262 +++$+++ u8140 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ UNCLE JOHN +++$+++ How we gonna get that lucky?
L575261 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
L575260 +++$+++ u8140 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ UNCLE JOHN +++$+++ What's in it?
L575259 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
L575258 +++$+++ u8140 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ UNCLE JOHN +++$+++ I don't get it.
L575257 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ "He ain't wrong."  Listen, I know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  <u>That's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
L575256 +++$+++ u8140 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ UNCLE JOHN +++$+++ Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.
L575255 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
L575254 +++$+++ u8140 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ UNCLE JOHN +++$+++ Like what.
L575253 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ You bet.
L575252 +++$+++ u8140 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ UNCLE JOHN +++$+++ You do?
L575251 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
L575250 +++$+++ u8140 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ UNCLE JOHN +++$+++ What?
L575249 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Something's on.
L575248 +++$+++ u8140 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ UNCLE JOHN +++$+++ There is?
L575247 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ There's more than a measly few grand in this.
L575246 +++$+++ u8140 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ UNCLE JOHN +++$+++ We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
L575202 +++$+++ u8140 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ UNCLE JOHN +++$+++ Lemme break.
L575201 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Straight rotation, no shit, call your shot.
L575137 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Any happier than any other asshole in life.
L575136 +++$+++ u8140 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ UNCLE JOHN +++$+++ What d'you mean, any happier?
L575135 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
L575134 +++$+++ u8140 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ UNCLE JOHN +++$+++ I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.
L575133 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ So what.
L575132 +++$+++ u8140 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ UNCLE JOHN +++$+++ She's nice lookin'.
L575131 +++$+++ u8140 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ UNCLE JOHN +++$+++ That don't mean nothin'.
L575130 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
L575129 +++$+++ u8140 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ UNCLE JOHN +++$+++ Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.
L575119 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ The L.A.P.D.
L575118 +++$+++ u8140 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ UNCLE JOHN +++$+++ I don't know.
L575117 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
L575116 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
L575115 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
L575114 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
L575113 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ ... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
L575112 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
L575111 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
L575110 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Good luck.
L575109 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow.
L575065 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ The forever kind.
L575064 +++$+++ u8140 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ UNCLE JOHN +++$+++ Which kind?
L575063 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Yeah.
L575062 +++$+++ u8140 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ UNCLE JOHN +++$+++ Makin' trouble for someone?
L575061 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ I got half.
L575060 +++$+++ u8140 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ UNCLE JOHN +++$+++ Hey.
L575059 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Five thousand.
L575058 +++$+++ u8140 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ UNCLE JOHN +++$+++ How much.
L574741 +++$+++ u8138 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ SUPERVISOR +++$+++ Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
L574740 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Where is he, then?
L574739 +++$+++ u8138 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ SUPERVISOR +++$+++ What do you think?
L574738 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Is Valentine here?
L574737 +++$+++ u8138 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ SUPERVISOR +++$+++ Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now.
L574736 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ You know her?
L574735 +++$+++ u8138 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ SUPERVISOR +++$+++ Jennifer Wilson.
L574734 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
L574733 +++$+++ u8138 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ SUPERVISOR +++$+++ So why would he want to see you.
L574732 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ I doubt it.
L574731 +++$+++ u8138 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ SUPERVISOR +++$+++ He's expecting you?
L574730 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him?
L574729 +++$+++ u8138 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ SUPERVISOR +++$+++ You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
L574728 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Walked.
L574727 +++$+++ u8138 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ SUPERVISOR +++$+++ How'd you get in here.
L575301 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
L575300 +++$+++ u8139 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
L575299 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Go now.
L575298 +++$+++ u8139 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Who's looking for you?
L575297 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ In a couple of days this whole thing --
L575296 +++$+++ u8139 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Are you finished?
L575295 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp --
L575294 +++$+++ u8139 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You know I don't live with him.
L575293 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Is he here?
L575292 +++$+++ u8139 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ -- You know his name is Frank.
L575291 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
L575288 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Susan.
L575287 +++$+++ u8139 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
L575286 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ No trouble.
L575285 +++$+++ u8139 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ What kind of trouble are you in?
L575284 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Sure you do.
L575283 +++$+++ u8139 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I don't want you here, Terry.
L575282 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ You've made it ... brighter.
L575281 +++$+++ u8139 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ They're at college.  Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.
L575280 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ I miss my kids.
L575279 +++$+++ u8139 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Since when?
L575278 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Exercising my visitation rights.
L575277 +++$+++ u8139 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L575276 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Hello there.
L575355 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ <u>Why</u> then.  Why did you do it!
L575354 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ She could've had the deal!  I would've handed it to her if she wanted.  I would have given her everything.
L575352 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ About Jenny.  Tell me about Jenny.  About the <u>deal</u>.  Whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard.
L575351 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Tell you ...
L575350 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Tell me.
L575349 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ What.
L575000 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Be seein' you.
L574999 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Thanks.  You, too.
L574995 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Oh, I think a shake-up was in order. Definitely.  Otherwise, people get lazy, don't they?  Forgetful.  Start thinking they can get away with things.  Gotta shake 'em up now and again, make 'em pay attention.
L574994 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
L574993 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
L574992 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ I don't.
L574991 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ You must know Ian.
L574990 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Ah.
L574989 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
L574988 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
L574987 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Pleasure.
L575849 +++$+++ u8143 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again.
L575848 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?
L575847 +++$+++ u8143 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. They try to limit it, and--
L575846 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Ann--
L575845 +++$+++ u8143 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
L575844 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Ann--
L575843 +++$+++ u8143 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
L575842 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...Yes?
L575841 +++$+++ u8143 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ We went camping last summer. In Eugene, Oregon. *Outside* of Eugene, Ed.
L575840 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yes?
L575838 +++$+++ u8143 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ And you should tell Doris...

L575836 +++$+++ u8143 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came to tell you...
L575835 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Of course, you know, Doris had nothing to do with it. Nothing at all.
L575834 +++$+++ u8143 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yes. Thank you.

L576087 +++$+++ u8144 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ BIRDY +++$+++ Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please--
L576086 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...No, please.
L576083 +++$+++ u8144 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ BIRDY +++$+++ It's OK...
L576082 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Birdy--
L576081 +++$+++ u8144 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ BIRDY +++$+++ ...I wanted to make you happy.

L576079 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...I guess I've been all wet.
L576078 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
L576077 +++$+++ u8144 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ BIRDY +++$+++ You're an enthusiast.
L576076 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Huh.
L576075 +++$+++ u8144 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ BIRDY +++$+++ I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
L576074 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Ah... it's nothing.
L576073 +++$+++ u8144 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ BIRDY +++$+++ I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
L576072 +++$+++ u8150 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ...Uh-huh.
L576071 +++$+++ u8144 +++$+++ m553 +++$+++ BIRDY +++$+++ ...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.
