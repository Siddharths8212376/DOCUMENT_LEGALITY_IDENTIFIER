L566823 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
L566822 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ ...Shut up, Sue...
L566821 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
L566820 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ ...Sue...
L566815 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ ...Oh yeah, like "Cypress Hill" was gonna do anything...
L566814 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
L566813 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ ...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K- car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat.
L566810 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ ...Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey.
L566809 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ ...Anaheim...
L566804 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ What'd you want me to do? Back down? He called me a bitch. We kept our rep.
L566803 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ You dick.
L566791 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Don't listen to him. You call whenever it feels right to you.
L566790 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party.
L566786 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
L566785 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ ...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
L566784 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ ...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
L566783 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard...
L566780 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ ...Yeah.
L566779 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ ...Tomorrow, then a day.
L566772 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.
L566771 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ You're money.
L566770 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Now go over there and get those digits.
L566769 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ ...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
L566768 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ ...you're money...
L566767 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ ...honestly...
L566764 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ ...you're like a big bear.
L566763 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ ...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
L566762 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ ...and you got big claws and fangs...
L566761 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ ...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
L566760 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ ...You're just poking at it...
L566759 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ ...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
L566758 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ ...shivering...
L566757 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ ...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
L566756 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ ...and big fuckin' teeth...
L566755 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
L566754 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ ...we're not...
L566751 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ That's what I keep trying to tell him.  You're so money, you don't even know...
L566750 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ You are so money, and you don't even know it...
L566749 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Baby, don't talk that way, baby...
L566717 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ True.
L566716 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ ...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
L566715 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ ...double diamond...
L566714 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
L566713 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ You think?
L566712 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ It's on.
L566700 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ What was cold about it?
L566699 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ That was pretty cold, dude.
L566678 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Damn. Now I gotta go in early.
L566677 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Yes she did.
L566667 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ See, baby?
L566666 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
L566665 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Is she looking now?
L566664 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ No.
L566663 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Now?
L566662 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ No.
L566661 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Is she looking at me, baby?
L566645 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ ...It's on.
L566644 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Oh, it's on, baby...
L566567 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ ...How novel.
L566566 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ What a surprise...
L566551 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ ...Is he brown?
L566550 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Is he cute? Ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail!
L566540 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Yeah... If you hit them hard their heads bleed all over the ice and their legs convulse.
L566539 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ You could make their heads bleed, though.
L566538 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
L566531 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
L566530 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
L566529 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ They're a finesse team...
L566528 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ ...against the computer.
L566525 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
L566524 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Because he's a bitch.
L566521 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Chelios to Roenick...!
L566520 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Bitch... You little bitch!
L566342 +++$+++ u3093 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ I'll be back with the coffee.
L566341 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
L566340 +++$+++ u3093 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ And you?
L566328 +++$+++ u3093 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ Six.
L566327 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Beautiful. What time are you off...  ...Christy?
L566326 +++$+++ u3093 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
L566325 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ ...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.
L593445 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ You owe the Don a service.  He has no doubt that you will repay it.
L593444 +++$+++ u3094 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ BONASERA +++$+++ Yes, I understand I'm listening.
L593443 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.
L593425 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Yes. 
L593424 +++$+++ u3094 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ BONASERA +++$+++ The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
L593423 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Good.  He never doubted you.
L593422 +++$+++ u3094 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ BONASERA +++$+++ Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
L593421 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ You owe the Don a service.  In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  Be there to greet him.  If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him.
L593420 +++$+++ u3094 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ BONASERA +++$+++ Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.
L593432 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ I want you to use all your powers, all your skill, as you love me.  I do not want his mother to see him as he is.
L593431 +++$+++ u3094 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ BONASERA +++$+++ What do you wish me to do?
L592864 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ Some day, and that day may never come, I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return.
L592863 +++$+++ u3094 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ BONASERA +++$+++ Godfather.
L592862 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
L592861 +++$+++ u3094 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ BONASERA +++$+++ Be my friend.
L592860 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ Then take the justice from the judge, the bitter with the sweet, Bonasera.  But if you come to me with your friendship, your loyalty, then your enemies become my enemies, and then, believe me, they would fear you...
L592859 +++$+++ u3094 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ BONASERA +++$+++ America has been good to me...
L592858 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ You never think to protect yourself with real friends.  You think it's enough to be an American.  All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship.  And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.
L592857 +++$+++ u3094 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ BONASERA +++$+++ Then make them suffer as she suffers.  How much shall I pay you.
L592856 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ But your daughter is still alive.
L592855 +++$+++ u3094 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ BONASERA +++$+++ An eye for an eye!
L592854 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ The Court gave you justice.
L592853 +++$+++ u3094 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ BONASERA +++$+++ I ask for Justice.
L592852 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ No.  You ask for too much.
L592851 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ And what is that Bonasera?
L592850 +++$+++ u3094 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ BONASERA +++$+++ What do you want of me?  I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask!
L592849 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ Bonasera, we know each other for years, but this is the first time you come to me for help.  I don't remember the last time you invited me to your house for coffee...even though our wives are friends.
L593724 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Good, good.  Leave now; there's a car waiting to take you to the airport.
L593723 +++$+++ u3095 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CARLO +++$+++ Barzini.
L593722 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Don't be frightened.  Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you think I'd make your children fatherless?  After all, I'm Godfather to your son.  No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business.  I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there.  I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.  Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini?
L593721 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Barzini is dead.  So is Philip Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo and Moe Greene...I want to square all the family accounts tonight. So don't tell me you're innocent; admit what you did.
L593720 +++$+++ u3095 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CARLO +++$+++ I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent.  Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!
L593719 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people.  That little farce you played out with my sister.  Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone?
L593718 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You have to answer for Santino.
L593717 +++$+++ u3095 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CARLO +++$+++ Godfather!
L593704 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Go back to your house and wait for me...
L593703 +++$+++ u3095 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CARLO +++$+++ Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...
L593638 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'll come to you when I need you.
L593637 +++$+++ u3095 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CARLO +++$+++ Understood.  I just wish I was doing more to help out.
L593408 +++$+++ u3097 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ Like hell I will.
L593407 +++$+++ u3095 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CARLO +++$+++ You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.
L593406 +++$+++ u3097 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ BA FA GOULE YOU!
L593405 +++$+++ u3095 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CARLO +++$+++ Ba Fa Goulle.
L593404 +++$+++ u3097 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ Eat it, it's on the table.
L593403 +++$+++ u3095 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CARLO +++$+++ I'm not hungry yet.
L593402 +++$+++ u3097 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ The food is on the table.
L593401 +++$+++ u3095 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CARLO +++$+++ OK, OK.  You gonna make me something to eat at least?
L593400 +++$+++ u3097 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ You're staying home.  You're not going out.
L593398 +++$+++ u3097 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ Your girl friend.  She says she can't make it tonight.  You lousy bastard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number. I'll kill you, you bastard!
L593397 +++$+++ u3095 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CARLO +++$+++ What was that?
L593381 +++$+++ u3095 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CARLO +++$+++ Shut up.
L593380 +++$+++ u3097 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ What's the matter, Carlo?
L593327 +++$+++ u3096 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++ We gotta move...
L593326 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
L593325 +++$+++ u3096 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++ The gun will be there.
L593324 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun.  I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.
L593235 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ OK, but be careful.
L593234 +++$+++ u3096 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++ Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.
L593229 +++$+++ u3096 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++ You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's sick for good this winter.
L593228 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ You take care of Paulie?
L593185 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Okay, now you can move your men into the Mall, replace Tessio's people.  Mike, tomorrow you take a couple of Clemenza's people and go to Luca's apartment and wait for him to show.  That crazy bastard might be going after Sollozzo right now if he's heard the news.
L593184 +++$+++ u3096 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++ Understood.
L593183 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood?
L593099 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ No, just you and Paulie.
L593098 +++$+++ u3096 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++ That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
L593097 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
L593096 +++$+++ u3096 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++ Maybe three, four times.  I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
L593095 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
L593094 +++$+++ u3096 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++ Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
L593093 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
L593092 +++$+++ u3096 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++ The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
L593091 +++$+++ u3112 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Yeah.
L593090 +++$+++ u3096 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++ You heard about your father?
L593628 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Maybe less...
L593627 +++$+++ u3096 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++ Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
L593626 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.  No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it.  Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.
L593620 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.
L593619 +++$+++ u3096 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++ We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.
L593312 +++$+++ u3096 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++ Probably all the other families will line up against us.  But, it's alright.  These things have to happen once every ten years or so...gets rid of the bad blood. You gotta stop 'em at the beginning. Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at Munich, they shoulda never let him get away with that, they were just asking for big trouble...
L593311 +++$+++ u3105 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ How bad will it be?
L593310 +++$+++ u3096 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++ Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light.  Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.
L593209 +++$+++ u3109 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ PAULIE +++$+++ Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.
L593208 +++$+++ u3096 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++ Maybe, or you gotta know now.
L593207 +++$+++ u3109 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ PAULIE +++$+++ You think we'll go for that last place?
L593202 +++$+++ u3096 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++ OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose to call when I found somethin'.
L593201 +++$+++ u3109 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ PAULIE +++$+++ Good for ten men...
L593199 +++$+++ u3096 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++ Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
L593198 +++$+++ u3109 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ PAULIE +++$+++ I'll think about it.
L593182 +++$+++ u3109 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ PAULIE +++$+++ Sure.
L593181 +++$+++ u3096 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++ Outside.
L593176 +++$+++ u3109 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ PAULIE +++$+++ The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package...
L593175 +++$+++ u3096 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++ I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...
L592872 +++$+++ u3096 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ CLEMENZA +++$+++ What are you, a dance judge?  Go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood... see everything is okay.
L592871 +++$+++ u3109 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ PAULIE +++$+++ You look terrif on the floor!
L593025 +++$+++ u3111 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SOLLOZZO +++$+++ The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
L593024 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ No.
L593023 +++$+++ u3111 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SOLLOZZO +++$+++ Are you worried about security for your million?
L593022 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ No...how a man makes his living is none of my business.  But this proposition of yours is too risky. All the people in my family lived well the last ten years, I won't risk that out of greed.
L593019 +++$+++ u3111 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SOLLOZZO +++$+++ If you think two million dollars in cash is just finance, I congratulate you Don Corleone.
L593018 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ So.  I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.  No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
L593017 +++$+++ u3111 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SOLLOZZO +++$+++ My compliments.  I'll take care of them from my share.
L593016 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?
L593015 +++$+++ u3111 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SOLLOZZO +++$+++ Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
L593014 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ What percentages for my family?
L593013 +++$+++ u3111 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SOLLOZZO +++$+++ I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend.
L593012 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity?
L593011 +++$+++ u3111 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ SOLLOZZO +++$+++ My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production.  My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss.  The risk is nothing, the profits enormous.
L592971 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
L592970 +++$+++ u3103 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
L592969 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ You look terrible.  I want you to eat well, to rest.  And spend time with your family.  And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.
L592968 +++$+++ u3103 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Sure.
L592967 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ You take care of your family?
L592966 +++$+++ u3103 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ He owns the studio.  Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller.  And the main character is a guy just like me.  I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself.
L592965 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.
L592957 +++$+++ u3103 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ I'm not rich anymore, Godfather, and...my career, I'm almost washed up...
L592956 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
L592955 +++$+++ u3103 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ I kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy.  When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather.
L593651 +++$+++ u3102 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ HAGEN +++$+++ Maybe I can help.
L593650 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace.  He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune.  Michael has all my confidence, as you do.  For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen.
L593461 +++$+++ u3098 +++$+++ m203 +++$+++ DON CORLEONE +++$+++ Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could never have outfought Santino.  But I wasn't sure until this day.  No, it was Barzini all along.
