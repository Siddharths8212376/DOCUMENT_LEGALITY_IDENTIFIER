L377575 +++$+++ u6568 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone who'll listen. "Remember Sammy Jankis, remember Sammy Jankis". Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember?
L377574 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ He knew about Sammy. Why would I tell him about Sammy?							  *

L377486 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Why?
L377478 +++$+++ u6568 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.

L377291 +++$+++ u6568 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.

L377289 +++$+++ u6568 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.
L377288 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -
L377287 +++$+++ u6568 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
L377286 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.

L377280 +++$+++ u6568 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
L377279 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ What sort of questions?
L377278 +++$+++ u6568 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
L377277 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Why?
L377276 +++$+++ u6568 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ I won't be happy until you leave town.

L377274 +++$+++ u6568 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ I'm trying to help you. I knew she'd get her claws into you. She doesn't know anything about your investigation, so when she offers to help you, it'll be for her own reasons. Why would I lie? Do not go back to her. Take out a pen, write yourself a note, do not trust her.
L377273 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Why are you following me?

L377268 +++$+++ u6568 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.

L377168 +++$+++ u6568 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson.
L377166 +++$+++ u6568 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ Fucking hope not.
L377165 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
L377161 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ I don't know.
L377160 +++$+++ u6568 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
L377159 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
L377158 +++$+++ u6568 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.

L377142 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ I might have fallen asleep before I did.
L377141 +++$+++ u6568 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
L377140 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ I don't think so.
L377139 +++$+++ u6568 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ No! Should I?
L377138 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ You don't know him?
L377137 +++$+++ u6568 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes.
L377136 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Why are you here?
L377050 +++$+++ u6568 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ Probably left it in your room.
L377049 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
L377047 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have.
L377046 +++$+++ u6568 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ You're living.
L377045 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
L377044 +++$+++ u6568 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ You really want to find this guy?
L377040 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Why?
L377039 +++$+++ u6568 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
L377038 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
L377037 +++$+++ u6568 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
L377036 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Why?
L377035 +++$+++ u6568 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right?
L377034 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Who?
L377033 +++$+++ u6568 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?
L377032 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
L377031 +++$+++ u6568 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ You don't have to remember to be hungry.
L377030 +++$+++ u6563 +++$+++ m436 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts.

L380037 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Yeah.
L380546 +++$+++ u6570 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CASTILLO +++$+++ Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?
L380545 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Just came in.  She's still alive.
L380536 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ You can't.
L380535 +++$+++ u6570 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CASTILLO +++$+++ Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
L380534 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ It's a rip and a hit.
L380533 +++$+++ u6570 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CASTILLO +++$+++ What do you think?
L380532 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...
L380531 +++$+++ u6570 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CASTILLO +++$+++ Where's the new drop point...?
L380530 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ José Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
L380529 +++$+++ u6570 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CASTILLO +++$+++ Yeah?
L380092 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Three wakes off the back of those boats.  Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull?
L380091 +++$+++ u6570 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CASTILLO +++$+++ Okay.  What'd you spot...?
L380089 +++$+++ u6570 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CASTILLO +++$+++ Good.
L380088 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ He is fine.  And we know the jokes. When it gets vengeful, things get messy.  When they get messy the wrong people die...  Everybody gets it.
L380062 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Recruit us to do what?
L380061 +++$+++ u6570 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CASTILLO +++$+++ ...I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement.  We don't know who's straight up, who's not...
L380391 +++$+++ u6570 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CASTILLO +++$+++ No, you don't, Jim.  'Cause if I close this down, you got nothing to make a phone call about.  And my guys don't have a week for a Feeb bureaucratic process.  Every hour longer they're in there, they risk exposure.  So, right here, right now, they're back in or I pull them out and close you down.  What's it going to be?
L380390 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ I got to talk to my ADO...
L380389 +++$+++ u6570 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CASTILLO +++$+++ Yes you do...
L380388 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ I don't know.
L380082 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ Of course.  From my side, I don't WANT to know anything about what you're doing or how you do it...  So let me know if we're on...
L380081 +++$+++ u6570 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CASTILLO +++$+++ I mean <u>full</u> disclosure.
L380080 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ Sure.
