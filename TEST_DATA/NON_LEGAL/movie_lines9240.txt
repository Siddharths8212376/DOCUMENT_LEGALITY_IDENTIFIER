L386484 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ I don't want John Anderton hurt.
L386483 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
L386482 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ He's my subordinate!
L386481 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.
L386480 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ None of your damn business.
L386479 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
L386478 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
L386477 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
L386476 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
L386475 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
L386870 +++$+++ u1929 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ RUFUS +++$+++ Get the hell outta here.  You sick bastard.
L386869 +++$+++ u1920 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ CUSTOMER +++$+++ No, I wanna kill my boss!
L386868 +++$+++ u1929 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ RUFUS +++$+++ Uh, yeah, being concert master of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra is one of our most popular choices...
L386866 +++$+++ u1929 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ RUFUS +++$+++ Good.  What I can do is set you up down in the --
L386865 +++$+++ u1920 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ CUSTOMER +++$+++ Right here.
L386864 +++$+++ u1929 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ RUFUS +++$+++ Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
L386863 +++$+++ u1920 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ CUSTOMER +++$+++ I wanna kill my boss.
L386862 +++$+++ u1929 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ RUFUS +++$+++ Near Death's real popular right now, which includes everything from getting hit by a car, to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush, you come out the other side without a heart attack.
L387047 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ None.  This was arranged.
L387046 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ How many?
L387045 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?
L387044 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.
L387043 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
L387042 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ What kind of cop were you before this?
L387041 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
L387040 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
L387039 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ I don't know, why?
L387038 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ There a maid in this hotel?
L386858 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ No.  He can't...
L386857 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
L386856 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ He's trying to prove his innocence.
L386820 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ She's in the room with him when he kills Crow.  She's already a part of his future.
L386819 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ We can stop him.
L386818 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ It doesn't matter.  He wins.
L386768 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ Two?
L386767 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
L386604 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Because he thinks he's innocent.
L386603 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
L386602 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket.  There's fewer consumers down there, which means fewer scanners to target him.
L386600 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ They're everywhere.
L386599 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ There's thousands of units like this one.
L386598 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
L386496 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Yes, I know.
L386495 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.
L386473 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ What?!
L386472 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
L386471 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
L386239 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Somehow, I don't think that was Walt Whitman.
L386238 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ Because of the nature of murder.  "There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another".
L386221 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
L386220 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
L386110 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ People have gotten the message.  Gum?
L386109 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
L386108 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ That's the Red Ball Alarm.
L386107 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Can't they shut that off?
L386103 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.
L386102 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.
L386098 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Nice to meet you.  Gum?
L386097 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ This is Evanna, the team pilot.
L387238 +++$+++ u1927 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ KNOTT +++$+++ You "friend's" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  Six years, not one damn murder...
L387237 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ John Anderton was my friend!
L387236 +++$+++ u1927 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ KNOTT +++$+++ Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.
L387235 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ Why don't I feel like celebrating?
L386741 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ Knott!
L386740 +++$+++ u1927 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ KNOTT +++$+++ People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
L386729 +++$+++ u1927 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ KNOTT +++$+++ It's not at all that you don't trust me to be alone with the Chief.  That you think I might, you know, fuck with him, if I had the chance...
L386728 +++$+++ u1922 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ FLETCHER +++$+++ I think you're swell company, Knott.
L386727 +++$+++ u1927 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ KNOTT +++$+++ That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie, isn't it?
L386154 +++$+++ u1924 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ HOWARD +++$+++ I forgot my glasses.
L386153 +++$+++ u1930 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Howard --
L386120 +++$+++ u1924 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ HOWARD +++$+++ Sure.  Raincheck.
L386119 +++$+++ u1930 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Raincheck?
L386118 +++$+++ u1924 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ HOWARD +++$+++ Ah.  That must be why you look so nice.
L386117 +++$+++ u1930 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
L386116 +++$+++ u1924 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ HOWARD +++$+++ We could have lunch together.
L386114 +++$+++ u1924 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ HOWARD +++$+++ I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.
L386113 +++$+++ u1930 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ What about your meeting?
L386065 +++$+++ u1930 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ How can you even tell?  You know how blind you are without your glasses.
L386064 +++$+++ u1924 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ HOWARD +++$+++ The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
L386063 +++$+++ u1930 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Who?
L386062 +++$+++ u1924 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ HOWARD +++$+++ He looks familiar.
L386692 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
L386691 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ I haven't seen him in two years.
L386690 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
L386689 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ To what?  Trap him?
L386688 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ You know I need to use you.
L386687 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.
L386686 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
L386685 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Not very well, I'm sure.  I'd probably start doping myself.  Or maybe I'd...
L386684 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
L386683 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
L386682 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
L386681 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ What was it then?
L386680 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
L386679 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
L386678 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ Yes.
L386677 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ But John was with him at the pool?
L386676 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ It was nobody's fault.
L386675 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ You mean after he lost your son.
L386674 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ Since right after we lost our son.
L386671 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Have you been there recently?
L386670 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ That was our apartment.
L386669 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ So you haven't seen his apartment?
L386668 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
L386667 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
L386666 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ No.
L386665 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
L386664 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ I don't have any sugar either.
L386662 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ He's not here now, is he?
L386661 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ We used to, every summer.
L386660 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
L386659 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
L386658 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Cream and sugar.
L386657 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
L386656 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ I like it.
L386655 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ Yes.
L386654 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ This your work?
L386653 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ I know who you are.
L386652 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
L386815 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Jesus...
L386814 +++$+++ u1933 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female, she's the key.  She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.
L386813 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
L386812 +++$+++ u1933 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
L386811 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Wally, the other two can still function, right?
L386810 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ But there's still the other two.
L386809 +++$+++ u1933 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
L386808 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ What does he want with a precog?
L386807 +++$+++ u1933 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ They've never been separated before.
L386260 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Tell me how all this works.
L386259 +++$+++ u1933 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Shhh!  They're sleeping.
L386258 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Nice to meet you, Wally.
L360354 +++$+++ u1935 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ Good luck.
L360353 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
L360352 +++$+++ u1935 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
L360351 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ They were grabbing her fucking ass --
L360350 +++$+++ u1935 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
L360349 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L360348 +++$+++ u1935 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ Look, Bobby, I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know what happened, but something's up.
L360362 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No, thank you. I'm good. Thanks.
L360361 +++$+++ u1936 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ You sure? I just made it.
L360360 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No thank you.
L360359 +++$+++ u1936 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?
L360358 +++$+++ u1936 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
L360357 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah.
L360356 +++$+++ u1936 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ You're Bobby, right?
L360355 +++$+++ u1940 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben.
L360292 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ Then put my Martel's in a snifter.
L360291 +++$+++ u1937 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ We have snifters
L360290 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
L360289 +++$+++ u1937 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ When served warm --
L360288 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
L360287 +++$+++ u1937 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ Snifter are for warm drinks --
L360286 +++$+++ u1947 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ HORRACE +++$+++ Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
L360689 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ See you later.
L360688 +++$+++ u1938 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BELLMAN +++$+++ It's on West Broadway.
L360687 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
L360686 +++$+++ u1938 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BELLMAN +++$+++ I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
L360685 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
L360684 +++$+++ u1938 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BELLMAN +++$+++ Women?
L360683 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
L360682 +++$+++ u1938 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BELLMAN +++$+++ As far as...?
L360681 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Where's the place to go tonight?
L360680 +++$+++ u1938 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BELLMAN +++$+++ Thank you, sir.
L360679 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
L360678 +++$+++ u1938 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BELLMAN +++$+++ It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
L360677 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ What if I gave you forty?
L360676 +++$+++ u1938 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BELLMAN +++$+++ Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
L360675 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
L360674 +++$+++ u1938 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BELLMAN +++$+++ All the suites are about the same.
L360673 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Is it the good room?
L360672 +++$+++ u1938 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BELLMAN +++$+++ What, sir?
L360671 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ So?
L360670 +++$+++ u1938 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BELLMAN +++$+++ Thank you very much, sir.
L360669 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Yeah. Take it.
L360668 +++$+++ u1938 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BELLMAN +++$+++ Are you sure?
L360667 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
L360666 +++$+++ u1938 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ BELLMAN +++$+++ Not on me, sir.
L360665 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?

L360956 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Look at, ladies. I could sit here and take turns throwing skittles at your ass all night. But I feel what you guys are putting out there. I'm only a mirror reflecting what I'm getting from you. And I'm saying yes to it. I'm shaking hands with it. I see the road that you're pointing down and I'm saying I'll ride shotgun. And when your foot slams on the accelerator, I won't get scared. I'll stand up and let the wind blow through my long blonde hair. With my summer dress clinging to my bosom yelling 'Faster, Billy! Faster! Drive faster! Faster yet -- !'
