L140662 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What happened to you?
L140661 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Get with it.  Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us.  Lost in space.  The universe doesn't care.  The cop, you, me?  Who notices?
L140660 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ ...indifferent.
L140659 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Then what are you?
L140658 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ That's the "why."  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die.
L140657 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ That's the reason?
L140656 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ How do I know?  But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me.  Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  I dunno.
L140655 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What'd they do?
L140654 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ And you believe me...?
L140653 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ That's what you said...
L140652 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ <u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
L140651 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You're full of shit.
L140650 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ You're too good.  We're in this together.  Fates intertwined.  Cosmic coincidence and all that crap...
L140649 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Whyn't you kill me and find another cab.
L140648 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ There you go...!
L140647 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ One more.
L140646 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
L140645 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What's at Union Station?
L140644 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Head towards Union Station.
L140643 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Some living.
L140642 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ It's what I do for a living.
L140641 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
L140640 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Yeah, that.
L140639 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ No, not just that.
L140638 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
L140637 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
L140636 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Who's Heller?
L140635 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You had to kill Heller?!
L140634 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Good.  Blood, urine and death get to you? Try deep breathing.  Or remember we all die anyway...
L140611 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ It's not what you owe <u>me.</u> Time is so fleeting.  One day it's gone.  You make it out of this alive, Max, you really should call her.  That's what I think.
L140610 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
L140609 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
L140608 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I don't know.
L140607 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Your lady friend.  The one who gave you her business card.  Think she was just being polite?
L140606 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Who?
L140605 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Would you have called her?
L140586 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ You do impress me, Max.  That you do.
L140585 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
L140584 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Washington and Holt.  Dance club called "Fever." Know it?
L140583 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Makes two of us.
L140582 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.
L140518 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ You tell me to start a union, I'm blowing your head off.  Quit stalling and get out of the cab.
L140517 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Paid sick leave?
L140516 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ No.
L140515 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You get benefits?
L140514 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
L140513 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ In case he asks.
L140512 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Why?
L140511 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ How long have you been a hit man?
L140510 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ We've both run out of options.  If it helps, take comfort in knowing you never had a choice.
L140509 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Vincent.  Don't make me do this. Don't make me get people killed.
L140508 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ That's jazz, my friend.  You said it yourself.  So don't tell me you don't know how to play between the notes.
L140507 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I...I wasn't thinking.  I just did it.
L140506 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Max.  You threw my briefcase in the river.  You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
L140505 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ No.  No way.  I can't do this.
L140504 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.
L140503 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
L140502 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
L140501 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Why me?  Why don't <u>you</u> do it?
L140500 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ You're gonna be me.  You're gonna go in, and you're gonna get the info on the remaining two hits.
L140499 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I don't get it.
L140498 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ The man who hired me for this contract.
L140497 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Dmitri?
L140496 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Our friends in Little Russia.  Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri.
L140495 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ In case <u>who</u> checks?
L140494 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ I'll just hold onto it for you.  In case they check.
L140493 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Why?
L140492 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Gimme your wallet.
L140490 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Good excuse.  How many others you got?
L140489 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Doesn't cover everything.
L140488 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ What, no insurance?
L140487 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
L140486 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
L140485 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I told you I don't like to talk about it.
L140484 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Yeah?  Like what?  Limos?
L140483 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...
L140482 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
L140481 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ It's not bullshit.
L140480 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
L140479 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L140478 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ I killed him.  When I was 15.  He was my first.  Nah, wishful thinking.  Liver cancer.
L140477 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What happened?
L140476 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
L140475 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yeah?  What happened?
L140474 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.
L140473 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
L140472 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
L140471 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
L140470 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
L140469 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Don't start.
L140468 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Limos, huh?
L140454 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Jazz.
L140453 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ What the fuck was <u>that?</u>
L140446 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You'd do her a favor.
L140445 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ You take one more step, I'll kill her.
L140435 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Oh, I'm captivated.
L140434 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Mom, Vincent's not interested.
L140395 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ There's no way I'm taking you to see my mother!
L140394 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention.  That's bad.  And that's not good...
L140393 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What difference does it make?
L140392 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ You go every night?
L140391 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ She's in the hospital.
L140390 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Show up for <u>what?</u>
L140388 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?
L140387 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Show up for what?
L140374 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Sure?  Like you didn't play him? String him along?  If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go?
L140373 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
L140372 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
L140371 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
L140370 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ <u>I don't wanna know you!</u>
L140369 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Don't even think you're walking away from me.
L140368 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Leave me alone.
L140367 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Max?  What are you doing?
L140366 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm done.  Find another cab.
L140365 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ What you mean, no?
L140364 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ No.
L140363 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Let's go.
L140347 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Jazz?  That's funny, coming from you.  Okay, some jazz for the jazz man. How's this?  I'll ask a question.
L140346 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow.  You like the man, you like the way he plays.  How about a little jazz, huh?
L140345 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ You mind?  I'm working here.
L140344 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Let him go, Vincent.
L140313 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ That's the point.  You play <u>between</u> the notes, you dance <u>around</u> the structure, you improvise.  Some people know where they're going to be ten years from now.  Same job, same neighbors, same shit over and over.  That's not living.  That's dying a little every day.  Not me, pal.  It's not knowing what's around the corner that makes like worth living.  That's jazz.  That guy up there, he knows what I'm talking about.  Hell, it's the same thing <u>he's</u> talking about, if you just open your ears.  You can hear it in the conversation he's having with that trumpet...
L140312 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm not catching a melody.
L140311 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
L140310 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ That what we're doing?  Flowing?
L140309 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
L140308 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I never learned jazz.
L140307 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ ...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening.  Awesome.  What do you think?
L140278 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Friend of mine told me about this great place in South Central.  Says it's like the birthplace of West Coast bebop.  Bird.  Dexter Gordon. Thelonious Monk.  Chet Baker.  I'll buy you a drink.  Expand your horizons...
L140277 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I listen to classical.
L140276 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Jazz.  Music.
L140275 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm...what?  Sorry?
L140274 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ But, hey, some good news.  This last one put me way ahead of schedule. We've actually got some time to kill.  Jazz?  You like jazz?
L140272 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Am I collateral?
L140271 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Yes, Max?
L140270 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Vincent?
L140269 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ People in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Draws attention, which is something you avoid in my line of work.  And for <u>you?</u> You attract attention, you're gonna get people killed who don't need to be.
L140268 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I don't understand...
L140267 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Collateral damage.
L140266 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What?
L140265 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Another collateral.
L140263 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yeah.
L140262 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes.  Where's the button?  Under the dash?
L140243 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Next time you pull any shit, I'm gonna kick your fat ass.
L140242 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
L140241 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Lenny?  You're an asshole.
L140232 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ No you don't.
L140231 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I need the job.
L140230 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ So what?
L140229 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
L140228 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Don't take that.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.
L140226 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ It was an accident.  I'm not liable.
L140225 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ It was an accident.  You're not liable.  Tell him.
L140213 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Lenny, my dispatcher.
L140212 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Who's that?
L140209 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Because I have a gun and I say so.
L140208 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Why?
L140207 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Hands on the wheel.  Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed.
L140180 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'll deal with it.  I will, I will...
L140179 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ That one's probably married.  Think of his kids.  His wife's pregnant...
L140178 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Good luck.  You think they got families?
L140177 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them.
L140176 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Believe it.
L140175 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I can't believe this.
L140174 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space.
L140173 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Please.  Don't do anything.
L140172 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ You're a cabby.  Like talk yourself out of a ticket?
L140171 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ How?
L140170 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Get rid of 'em.
L140169 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Yeah, like that...  But, anyway, nobody gets out of this alive.  Even if we quit smoking and cut out red meat.  Everybody dies.
L140168 +++$+++ u4584 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Oh, it's okay, then.  'Cause you're just taking out the garbage...
L140167 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.

L140161 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?

L140159 +++$+++ u4587 +++$+++ m302 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Nothing.  I only met him the one time.

But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max.  Improvise.  Life is that way.  Adapt to your environment.  Survive.  Darwin.  "Shit happens."  The I Ching.  Whatever. Roll with it.
