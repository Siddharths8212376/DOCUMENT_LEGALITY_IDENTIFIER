L439747 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You don't understand--
L439746 +++$+++ u2463 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ PASCOW +++$+++ The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
L439624 +++$+++ u2463 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ PASCOW +++$+++ Remember.
L439623 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Leave me alone!
L439622 +++$+++ u2463 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ PASCOW +++$+++ The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
L439621 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
L439620 +++$+++ u2463 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ PASCOW +++$+++ The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know.
L439619 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I--
L439890 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I'm sure.
L439889 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Louis, are you sure?
L439888 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
L439887 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
L439886 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You better get going, hon.
L439819 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You're doing fine.
L439818 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I'm going to try to do better.
L439817 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yes, I guess I do.
L439816 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
L439815 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ That's forgotten.
L439814 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard.
L439811 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ That's not true. The subject scares me. Because of Zelda.
L439810 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
L439809 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I heard you tonight.
L439627 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Good d--
L439626 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I got eggs down here!
L439625 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Getting there.
L439586 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her.
L439585 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Thank you, Louis.
L439583 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise.
L439582 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Well, honey...you know that...
L439581 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ And Church will be fine.
L439580 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face.
L439579 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place.
L439578 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I just said--
L439577 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ That's enough of that kind of talk!
L439576 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks.
L439575 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.
L439565 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die.
L439564 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
L439563 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
L439562 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
L439561 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ She's finally asleep.
L439524 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
L439523 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I think it's rather extraordinary.
L439508 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ It's beautiful!
L439507 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ My God!
L439483 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Did you see his shirt?
L439482 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ ---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
L439481 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
L439480 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?
L439477 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw the house, this field was under four feet of snow.
L439476 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
L439475 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ The movers--
L439458 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
L439457 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Thank you. Thank you so much.
L439454 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Jesus, the road!
L439453 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Gage's gone!
L439443 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Come on--let's parole 'em.
L439442 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ And Buckaroo Banzai.
L439440 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Louis, the house is beautiful.
L439439 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Let her go. It's cool.
L442427 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Mr. Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail -- you and Cotton.  I want every inch of the Pearl spic-and- span and ship-shape!
L442426 +++$+++ u2465 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ANAMARIA +++$+++ Aye, aye, sir!
L442425 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
L442088 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ They'll be anchored on the lee side.  Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island --
L442087 +++$+++ u2465 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ANAMARIA +++$+++ How does he do that?
L442020 +++$+++ u2465 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ANAMARIA +++$+++ I will.
L442019 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You'll get it back.  Or one better.
L442018 +++$+++ u2465 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ANAMARIA +++$+++ That boat is my livelihood!
L442017 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
L442016 +++$+++ u2465 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ANAMARIA +++$+++ My dory.  The Jolly Mon.  Where is it?
L442014 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
L442013 +++$+++ u2465 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ANAMARIA +++$+++ You stole my boat.
L442403 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ He didn't waste it.
L442402 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ Hah.  Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot.
L442214 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.  Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free.  I didn't when ... nor where.
L442213 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No!  You gave your word!
L442208 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ Eh?  You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.
L442207 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You must swear by the Holy Bible.
L442204 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ And Jack.  And the crew.  Free and unharmed.  If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.
L442203 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ We got that part.  Anything else?
L442202 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Elizabeth goes free!
L442201 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ Enough of that!  Name your terms.
L442194 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You can't.  I can.
L442193 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
L442192 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ She.  Goes.  Free.
L442191 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ What's in your head, boy?
L442400 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Or you could surrender.
L442399 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ So what now, Jack Sparrow?  Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?
L442394 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
L442393 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ Just so you know, Jack -- I don't think you're that clever.  I think you're a fool.  A mortal fool.
L442375 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ Aye, for us there is.
L442374 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ There's ... another exit?
L442372 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ Men!  Are you up for it?
L442371 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?
L442369 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Aye.  See, after you're done with the Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There you'll be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do?  Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who's to argue?  The Dauntless a first- rate ship-of-line, and with it, you can rule the seas.  But if you're Captain of the Dauntless, who's left for the Black Pearl?
L442368 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ That so?
L442367 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ The situation has changed.
L442366 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
L442365 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Like after you've killed ... Every ... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.
L442363 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ What're you suggesting?
L442362 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.
L442357 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.
L442356 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ Why don't I want to do this?
L442355 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ All right then.
L442354 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ No, I really think I do.
L442226 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ That's fair.
L442225 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You can go to your grave not knowing.
L442224 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ So how did you get off that island, anyway?
L442219 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ The last time you do this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.
L442218 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ You'd best take a swim, Jack.
L442217 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Someone needs to cut these bonds, then.
L442216 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ Now, Jack.  That reef is less than a league distant.  It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.
L442215 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime.  No good can come of it.
L442164 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ Bosun!  Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect, of course.
L442163 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'll watch my back.
L442162 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
L442161 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What -- you don't have the medallion?
L442159 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ You're playing this as close to the edge as any man, I'll give you that.  We might just have to sign articles, you and I.  Jack, you're a pirate at heart, that's certain.
L442158 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
L442157 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.
L442155 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ Track you down and --
L442154 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
L442153 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
L442152 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Wait as long as you like.
L442151 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.
L442150 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do?
L442149 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ I'll torture it out of you.
L442148 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse.  Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice.
L442146 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ I'm supposed to ... trust you?
L442145 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ That's right.
L442144 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ That's your offer?  You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?
L442143 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
L442142 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
L442141 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything.
L442140 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
L442137 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No you won't.
L442136 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ Say the name, or I slit your throat.
L442135 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
L442361 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ No.  But him I believe.  He us genuinely angry.
L442360 +++$+++ u2474 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ PINTEL +++$+++ Do you believe him?
L442339 +++$+++ u2474 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ PINTEL +++$+++ I guess there is a reason to fret.
L442338 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.
L442337 +++$+++ u2474 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ PINTEL +++$+++ No reason to fret.  It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
L442221 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
L442220 +++$+++ u2474 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ PINTEL +++$+++ That's proper, sir, according to the code.
L442200 +++$+++ u2474 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ PINTEL +++$+++ And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!
L442199 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
L442139 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ Now.  No, don't kill him.
L442138 +++$+++ u2474 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ PINTEL +++$+++ Now?
L442206 +++$+++ u2467 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Will -- you can't trust him.
L442205 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ Agreed.  You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --
L442090 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ Aye.  And not a bit of it any use to us, only hoarded.  But it will drive us no longer.
L442089 +++$+++ u2467 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ The curse drove you to gather this?
L441974 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ It's a piece of the treasure of Isla de Muerta.
L441973 +++$+++ u2467 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ It's a pirate medallion.
L441972 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ Do you not know what this is, then?
L441971 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ Would that I could.
L441970 +++$+++ u2467 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Then why aren't you eating?
L441969 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.
L441964 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ Now, none of that.  Please dig in.
L441963 +++$+++ u2467 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
L441962 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ Maid or not, it fits you.
L441862 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ It's you who invoked the parlay! Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand it over, now ... or these be the last friendly words you'll hear!
L441861 +++$+++ u2467 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Can I trust you?
L441860 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
L441859 +++$+++ u2467 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
L441858 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?
L441857 +++$+++ u2467 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Thank you, sir.
L441856 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ You've got sand, for a maid.
L441855 +++$+++ u2467 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
L441854 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ You have a name, missy?
L441851 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ Did you, now?
L441850 +++$+++ u2467 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
L441849 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
L441848 +++$+++ u2467 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I'll drop it!
L441847 +++$+++ u2467 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Very well.
L441846 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.  Means 'No.'
L441845 +++$+++ u2467 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I want you to leave.  And never come back.
L441844 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.  What is it you want?
L441843 +++$+++ u2467 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
L441842 +++$+++ u2466 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ BARBOSSA +++$+++ My apologies, miss.  As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
L442309 +++$+++ u2467 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Well, I am not going to stay hidden in some cabin, or I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage!
L442308 +++$+++ u2473 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ NORRINGTON +++$+++ That would hardly be proper.
L442307 +++$+++ u2467 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Then I can wear men's clothing.
L442306 +++$+++ u2473 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ NORRINGTON +++$+++ You may seclude yourself in my cabin.  I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
L442304 +++$+++ u2473 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ NORRINGTON +++$+++ I know where your heart truly lies.
L442303 +++$+++ u2467 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ What?
L442302 +++$+++ u2473 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ NORRINGTON +++$+++ Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.
L442299 +++$+++ u2467 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Not as a condition -- a request.
L442298 +++$+++ u2473 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ NORRINGTON +++$+++ I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
L442297 +++$+++ u2467 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.
L442294 +++$+++ u2467 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Commodore, please!
L442293 +++$+++ u2473 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ NORRINGTON +++$+++ Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
L442292 +++$+++ u2467 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ No.  The pirates have taken Will --
L442289 +++$+++ u2467 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
L442288 +++$+++ u2473 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ NORRINGTON +++$+++ You're speaking up for him again?
L442287 +++$+++ u2467 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Commodore, you can't do that!
L442286 +++$+++ u2473 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ NORRINGTON +++$+++ Elizabeth, I'm relieved you're safe.  Clap him in irons.  And behind his back this time.
L441758 +++$+++ u2467 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine!  Go capture him.
L441757 +++$+++ u2473 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ NORRINGTON +++$+++ On his heels!  Gillette, bring a squad down from the fort!  Elizabeth, are you --
